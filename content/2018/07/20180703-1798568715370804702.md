**19. 西****诺联****手****谢****健生要做掉****赵****岩，至少要卸掉****赵****岩的几****个胳****膊腿**


**Colluding with XIE Jiansheng to get rid of ZHAO Yan, or at least give him a severe wound.**


西诺最恨赵岩。西诺几次同谢健生通电话，让谢健生帮他除掉这个心头之患。谢健生向西诺保证说，只要赵岩再次进入港澳台或东南亚一带，谢健生一定会找人做掉赵岩，至少要卸掉赵岩的几个胳膊腿。西诺让几个人了解赵岩的行踪，随时发现赵岩出入美国的准确时间，以便实现他做掉赵岩的机会。


Sino hates ZHAO Yan the most. He called XIE Jiansheng many times and ask him to get rid of ZHAO Yan, his biggest enemy. XIE Jiansheng promised to Sino that he would find some people to get rid of ZHAO Yan so long as ZHAO re-enter Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan or any country in South East Asia, at least give ZHAO a severe wound. Sino sought many people to get ZHAO Yan’s whereabouts, his accurate information of departure/arrival of U.S. to realize the purpose of getting rid of ZHAO Yan.


**20. BBG作****证**


**BBG Testimony**


2017年11月初，我了解到BBG在15日将会有一次季度董事会，我14日便在网上登记了到这次BBG会上发言。西诺也让我帮助他登记。登记后，西诺跟我说他不会用英文讲演，请求我帮助他准备一份英文讲稿。我随手就给他准备了一份讲稿。西诺拿到讲稿后，就开始反复地朗读训练。

At beginning of Nov. 2017, I understand that on 15th, there would be a quarterly BBG board meeting. I therefore registered to testify on this BBG meeting. Sino also asked me to help him for the registration. Afterwards, he asked me to help him with an English lecture note as he told me he was not able to give English speech. I improvised a lecture note for him, after which he began to read it again and again. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXnZFnpvaV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXnZFnpvaV8)





[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9-o6Iro8og](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9-o6Iro8og)


回来后，西诺立即将我们在BBG的演讲录像等资料发给谢健生及中国公安，谢健生和郑介甫看了这个录像后，提出让西诺前往美国国会游说美国议员来砸掉郭文贵的政治庇护，并分头给西诺寄来大笔美金。


When the BBG meeting is over, Sino send the video clips and other documents of our speeches in BBG back to XIE Jiansheng and Chinese Police. After viewing these videos, XIE Jiansheng and ZHENG Jiepu proposed Sino to go to the Hills and lobby senators to destroy the political asylum application of GUO Wengui, they ever wired a big sum of money separately. 随后，西诺几次要我陪同他去美国国会。到了国会山，西诺就依次在各个议员或参议员的门口摆个Pose照相。我跟他说如此摆姿势造像过于做作。西诺竟然说这些照片都是摆个姿势骗骗谢健生和老共的，说老共警察根本就不懂美国国会，看到这种照片，就会以为你对美国国会有影响力，就会给提供活动经费了。


Later, Sino asked myself to go to the Hills many times, where Sino took pictures at the office of difference senators. I told him that these pictures are too artificial, while he said these pictures are made to show to XIE Jiansheng and the communist Party. He said Chinese Communist Party Police doesn’t know how U.S. Congress operates, with this sort of pictures, they would think you have some influencing power on U.S. congress and provide funds accordingly. 

西诺的BBG演讲不过就是跟着我去念了一下我的讲稿，就拿这个讲稿向中国公安讨要大笔经费。西诺还跟我说要给我分一半。我当然知道西诺又是在耍我玩。西诺后来要我跟他每个月至少去国会一次，说谢健生那些人见到这种照片就会出钱。我一口回绝西诺，拒绝陪西诺去国会山上演这种丑剧。






Sino’s BBG speech is nothing more than reading my improvised note, with that he can get big sum of fund from Chinese Police. Of course, he said he would split half to me, certainly I know he was playing me around again. Later Sino asked me to go to the Hills at least once a month, saying XIE Jiansheng and his folks would pay for these pictures. I rejected him. I didn’t like such kind of staged farce.

上面是西诺在2017年11月8日发在推特上的推文，也是谢建生立即转发的推文。这两张照片都是我给西诺拍摄的。西诺在那天里一个议员都不曾见到，也不曾见到什么办公室主任。进到这些议员办公室，我同坐在门口的助理交谈了几句，有些助理就要求我留下地址姓名，填一张表格，说明事由，或者是让我跟议员助理打电话联络约好会见时间。西诺连我们在说什么都不知道。西诺只是站在各个门口让我帮他拍照。


Above is Sino’s twitter on Nov. 8, 2017, which XIE Jiansheng re-twittered. I took these 2 pictures for Sino. On that day, Sino didn’t meet any senator, or any senator office administrator. We went to senators’ office, I had some conversation with assistants, some asked me to leave my address/name, fill a form and specify why we were there, or, I was asked to call assistants of senators to set an arrangement. Sino didn’t even know what we were talking about, all he was doing is standing at different doors and asking me to take pictures for him.

西诺将这些照片都发给谢建生。谢建生就向中国情报部门汇报说西诺已经说服美国国会议员帮助他们遣返郭文贵。看看上面西诺的推文，完全就是摆拍的照片，编造的故事。竟有中国情报部门相信西诺编造的这种低级故事！西诺自称是记者。我看他就是人民日报或环球时报记者嘛。也只有中共喉舌记者才会编造如此低级劣等新闻！


Sino send these pictures to XIE Jiansheng, while XIE reported these to China intelligence agency that Sino already convinced American senators to help to repatriate GUO Wengui. Look at the above twitters of Sino with staged picture, and fabricated stories. It’s funny that Chinese intelligence would believe such low-end fabricated stories. XI NUO claimed that he is a reporter, I would agree he is the reporter of the People’s Daily, or of the Global Times, because only reporters of Chinese Communist Party can fabricate such funny news.

Maloney议员是我好友，曾多次去我家。上面是在2009年她参加我主办“墙倒众人推”画展的照片。


Senator Maloney is my good friends, she visited my home many times. This picture was taken in 2009, when she attended an art show(*Push the Falling Wall*) that was organized by myself.

我本想带西诺去拜见Maloney议员，但Maloney议员不在。西诺居然就在门口摆拍几张照片，然后还发出新闻稿。这就是《博讯》记者的职业道德！也就会制造这种垃圾假新闻！


I was planning to visit Maloney with XI NUO, however, she was not around. Sino took several pictures, then released his news in BO XUN – this is the integrity of the reporter of BO XUN, specialized in fabricating garbage news!


**21. 路****见****不平一****声****吼！**


**Voice-Up aloud in response to unfairness!**


有人说我砸锅，为何又揭露砸锅大将西诺啊？问我到底是什么立场。


People may say that since I am opposing GUO Wengui, what are the reasons I oppose Sino, who is a leading opponent of GUO Wengui, and ask me which side I am with?

我就不明白了，问这种话的人为何要以郭文贵为参照系甚至是坐标原点啊？


I just don’t get it, if you ask me this question, why do you take GUO Wengui as the benchmark or reference point?当年，胡平、王军涛、刘青等十三大佬都算作是我的朋友。但当他们联名对王炳章落井下石之际，我挺身而出为王炳章辩诬，愤怒谴责胡平等十三大佬。见链接：
Years ago, HU Ping, Wang Juntao, LIU Qing and all the so-called 13 big men were all my friends. But when they jointly opposed WANG Bingzhang, I stood out and defend Mr. WANG by furiously condemning HU Ping and the so-called 13 big men. See address:

王炳章、杨建利等人被中共关押期间，我曾经多次发起联名信，要求中共释放王炳章、杨建利，见链接：

当郭文贵极其恶毒地诅咒胡平之际，我又发文棒喝郭文贵：

当李洪宽频繁发视频操郭文贵的娘和女儿时，我同样挺身而出谴责李洪宽:

[http://jasmine-action.blogspot.com/2018/06/blog-post.html](http://jasmine-action.blogspot.com/2018/06/blog-post.html)
当郭文贵诅咒要送西诺进监狱的时候，我义无反顾地为西诺辩护。


When GUO Wengui swore to send XI NUO to jail, I also defended Sino.

如今，当我发现西诺动用中共公安力量对郭文贵发起超限战之际，我依旧会全力揭露西诺的恶行。





TODAY, when I realized that Sino is waging an all-scale war against GUO Wengui, I will, as always, do my best to disclose Sino’s evil behaviors. 

我没有主人，没有朋友，没有永恒的敌人。朋友作恶事，我会象痛击敌人那样予以无情揭露。敌人被无端构陷或超限战，我也会为敌人挡子弹。





I work for nobody, I have no friends, I don’t have permanent enemies. When friend does evil, I will attack and disclose him as enemy. When enemy is being set up or trapped by all-scale war, I will take the bullet and cover my him.这就是我的一贯立场！


This is my standpoint as always.刘刚


LIU Gang, Jun 27, 2018
2018年6月27日





**西****诺****、****韦****石等人的回****应****推文**


**Replies by XI NUO and WEI Shi via twitter.**
西诺 @sinofreedom：刘刚先生刚刚搬离了我的住所，他希望有一个独立的空间。我也很珍惜我们将近10个月的友谊。既然有缘分能住在一起，就要好聚好散，没有必要成为敌人。我惊讶地看到刘先生将我再一次打成共特。我只能告诉公众，他说的不是真的。我并不后悔在刘最困难的时候我接纳了他，他需要同情，尽管他把同情视为粪土。


Sino @Sinofreedom: Mr. LIU Gang just moved out from my apartment, hoping for an independent space. I do cherish our 10-month-long friendship. We were lucky to meet and live together, we shall separate peacefully for the sake of our luck and there is no reason of turning each other into enemies. However, I am surprised to see that Mr. LIU once again alleges that I am the spy of CCP. I have to tell the public that all his words were not true. I didn’t regret for taking care of him during his most difficult times – he needed compassion, though eventually he treats my compassion as shit.


刘刚：请西诺将租房子的合同晒出来。看看究竟是谁租的？


LIU Gang: Sino, please show the house rental contract, so we need know indeed who was renting the apartment.


西诺的政治庇护被移民局拒绝，他早知道他无法通过政治庇护活动美国绿卡。早就说过他要同一个来自北京的名叫May的中老年妇女结婚，用结婚的名义再申请绿卡。最近，西诺说他会搬出去。我请西诺早日兑现诺言。





Sino’s own political asylum application was rejected by immigration bureau – he should have known it in advance clearly that U.S. green card cannot be applied thru political asylum application. I heard that he was going to marry Madam May from Beijing, a middle-late age lady, and then apply green card. Recently, Sino said he would move out, I hope he will realize his promise ASAP.

另外西诺用我及另外一位朋友的名义注册了名为“MeToo Chinese”的非盈利机构。西诺随后不同另外两位注册人商议，就以这个机构的名义贩卖所谓的“义工证”，并用这些义工证作为那些人申请政治庇护的证据材料。西诺给人造假政治庇护，初次面谈填表收受至少600美金，随后的移民局面谈收受2千美金，而西诺给人出具的发票却都是给我们机构的“捐款”收据。





I have to mention another thing, Sino established/registered a Non-profit organization named MeTooChinese, under the name of myself and another friend of mine. Without prior agreement with us (as registers), XI NUO began to sell so-called Volunteer Social Worker Certificate thru this Non-profit-Organization, these certificates later were taken as supporting documents to apply political asylum. Every time Sino handles fake political asylum application, he charges at least US$600 only for the initial interview/form completion, and another US$2,000 for arrangement of interviewing with immigration. All the receipts/invoices given to these applicants were under the name of this organization as donation.

我几次要求西诺停止这种做法，不得给他人发放所谓的义工证，停止盗用“MeToo Chinese”的名义给他人办理政治庇护。


I asked Sino to stop such practices several times and stop issuing such so-called Volunteer Social Worker Certificate and using the name of “MeTooChinese” for the purpose of political asylum application.

西诺早在两个月前就说要取消这个机构，同意不再用这个机构的名义办理政治庇护。但是，就在上周，西诺跟我说，他已经将这个机构由非盈利机构更改成盈利机构，这个机构与我无关了。





2 months ago, Sino told me that he was going to dissolve this organization, agreed to discontinue the use of the organization for political asylum application. However, 2 weeks ago, I was told by Sino that he has turned this organization to a for-profit organization, and this organization is no longer related with me at all.这他妈的就是在拿我当小孩子耍吗。请西诺讲述一下他说通过何种方式将这个非营利机构改成营利机构的？他又是通过何种方式将我除名的？我同另一注册人多次商讨如何制止西诺用我们的名义大搞造假庇护。最后才发现只能采取法律手段来制止西诺盗用我们的名义来兜售“义工证”和造假政治庇护。





Is he seriously playing me around as a kid? I would like to hear from him, how could he transform this non-profit organization to a for-profit one, how could he remove my name from the organization? I have been discussing with the other register of this organization on how to prevent Sino from beefing up his fake political asylum business under the name of this organization. Eventually we realized that litigation is our final resort to prevent Sino from selling Volunteer Social Worker Certificate and engaging his fake political asylum businesses under the name of the organization. 

公开西诺的违法犯罪行为，这是我们制止西诺将我们的机构变成一个违法犯罪团伙的必要措施，我们别无选择。


Disclosing Sino’s criminal misconducts is an imperative measure for us to prevent our organization from evolving into a criminal gang, we don’t have other options.  韦石 @wmeng8：精神困难，值得同情
WEI Shi@Wmeng8: (LIU Gang is) worthy of caring for (his) mental difficulties.  刘刚：韦石，你如果想为西诺背书，请将你的话说明白些。


我请你们公开辩论。如果韦石是说我精神困难，那么请直说。我也就对韦石不客气了。请韦石大胆地为西诺站台背书，不妨大胆地承认那次2·18会议是你韦石接受欠款并一手操办的。同西诺一道造假的人，包括萧姓医生，会计师，常斌，谢健生，等等，相信他们都会受到应有的法律制裁。请韦石也积极争取成为西诺的同伙帮凶！





LIU Gang: WEI Shi, please speak out explicitly if you want to endorse Sino.


I would like to ask you to debate in public. If WEI Shi said I am with mental difficulties, please speak out clearly. Please endorse XI NUO with courage, please admit that the meeting on Feb 18 organized by you is actually a result of taking money. All those who are making fake stuffs, inclusive Dr. XIAO, accountant, CHANG Bin, XIE Jiansheng, and more, I believe they all will receive deserved legal punishment. Please, Mr. WEI Shi, become XI NUO’s accomplice, quickly. **[以下****红****色部分****与****上面****内****容重****复****]**


**Repeat the following in red**

公开西诺的违法犯罪行为，这是我们制止西诺将我们的机构变成一个违法犯罪团伙的必要措施，我们别无选择。
既然西诺如此信口胡诌，我就一个一个地亮出西诺让我帮助翻译的大量文件，以及他欠我的费用。





Since Sino has fabricated so many fake stories, I have to released the documents that I have translated for him one by one and also disclose how much money he owns to me.

我到西诺家里同住，是说好我帮他翻译文件，特别是翻译那些政治庇护申请的相关文件。西诺同我的约定是我只管翻译，他负责收费和联络客户。所得收入他同我对半分。从2017年10月到2018年1月的三个月时间里，我给他翻译的这中政治庇护申请共有将近六十份。每份至少表格收取600美金，这些人还要另外交消费等等，拿到社安号时，至少收800美金。准备面试材料，收2000美金。今年一月份，有大量的人要到移民局面试，西诺让我帮助准备面试材料。西诺坚持要按他的方式准备面试材料，包括必须有萧医生出具的医生报告，有报税单，有受洗证，有他开具的“义工证”。我告诉西诺说，这都属于欺骗移民局的造假行为，是犯罪。我不同意按照这种方式准备面试材料。我只是同意翻译政庇申请人准备的中文材料。

西诺于是就自己去按照他的方式去收费和准备面试材料。我还警告他不得给人进行移民局面试培训，那都属于违法犯罪。


Reason of moving to Sino’s apartment, as was agreed with him, was to help him on document translation, esp. those documents related to political asylum application. What have been agreed was that I would be responsible for translation only, while he would responsible for collecting fees and contacting clients. It has also been agreed that all the fees collected would split half to myself. From Oct. 2017 to Jan 2018, 3 months period, I have translated about 60 political asylum application related documents for him. Every application of form would be charged at least US$600, plus tips, and when social security number approved and released, another minimum US$800. Preparing interviewing material, another US$2,000 charge per person. In Jan 2018, there were a big number of people going to immigration for interview and I was asked to prepare relevant documents and he insisted that I need to prepare the interview documents as per his approach, which must include medical report by Dr. XIAO, Tax Report, Baptism Paper, and Volunteer Social Worker Certificate issued by him. I told him that all these are defrauding and may subject to criminal charges and I didn’t agree to prepare interview documents in this way and I only agree to translate the Chinese document provided by these applicants.


但西诺就是一意孤行，对每个去移民局面试的人都请到家里至少培训三次，就是一句一句的传授那些申请人如何欺骗移民局的面试。就在上个月，有位名为刘娟的人要去移民局面试，面试前，西诺给刘娟训练了三次。西诺让我也给刘娟培训，我断然拒绝。


However, Sino continue his way, asking every applicant who were going to immigration interviews for at least 3 times training, to teach them on how to defraud during every step of the interview. Last month, there was an applicant (LIU Juan) going to immigration interview, she has received 3 trainings by Sino. Sino asked myself to deliver the training for LIU Juan and I rejected.


在三个月里，我给西诺翻译的政庇材料有60份。西诺自己还私下里做了很多这种政治庇护材料。西诺单独做的，全部归他自己。我翻译的六十个，西诺几次说过我们每人一半，去掉房租水电，西诺说他一定会按照约定给我应得的那一半。


Over the 3 months, I have translated 60 political asylum related documents for Sino. Without informing me, he has prepared a lot of similar political asylum documents alone. He took the money exclusively from those documents he worked alone. As for the 60 I have translated, he said several times that he would give me half of it, after deduction of house rental and utilities, as per what we have agreed before.


但是，西诺就是只说不做。甚至用各种谎言来搪塞我提出的不许盗用我和我们的非营利机构的名义去搞造假政治庇护。既然西诺如此不仁，我会将那60个西诺造假政庇的材料悉数公开，并指出西诺在这些政庇材料的造假之处。


Nevertheless, the way he walked is different from what he was talking. He fabricated endless lies to evade my disagreement of using the non-profit organization for fake political asylum application. In response to his untruthfulness, I will disclose those 60 fake political asylum application documents and indicate where did Sino make frauds in these documents.

这是西诺给刘娟造假政治庇护的首页截屏。刘娟在六月初刚刚去移民局面试。在这个申请表中，所用的申请人地址是西诺伪造的，根本就不是刘娟的住址。这个地址只是西诺租用的一个可以收发信件的地址。西诺给政治庇护的大多数人都是用的这个地址！


This is the page one screenshot of LIU Juan’s fake asylum application document. LIU Juan just finished her immigration interview at the beginning of June. In this form, address of applicant was fake, which is not LIU’s at all. This address is what Sino rented for mail correspondence purpose only, this address was used for most of Sino’s political asylum application clients.


常老板的事情被移民局调查后，西诺就将这些申请人的地址都修改成我新租用的房子的地址，每更换这样的一个地址，西诺收费至少一百美金！我几次规劝西诺不得用我的住所来作为给他人政治庇护的住址，可西诺就是一意孤行。对这种违法犯罪行为，以及盗用我名义、住址、公司的卑鄙行为，不揭露行吗？





After the immigration bureau launched the investigation against Mr. CHANG, Sino changed the applicants’ address to the address of my newly rented apartment, and Sino charged at least US$100 per person for this single address change. I urged him many times to not use my apartment address as his political asylum clients’ address. He chose to ignore my words. For all his criminal behaviors, and despicable doings of pirating my name, my address, my organization, shouldn't I disclose him?
