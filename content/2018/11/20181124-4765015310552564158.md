战友之声啸天分享



以下为郭文贵先生的第一人称叙述：



Before<br>we go into talking about Wang Jian，perhaps<br>we can first learn a bit more about HNA, Where he had been the chairman of the<br>board 在我们谈王健之前， 或许我们应该先了解一下他曾担任董事会主 席海航。



It<br>was also a vital core of the news I broke last year. 这也是我去年爆料的重要核心



HNA<br>was previously Hainan airlines Holdings Company limited in corporated in 1998



海航前身是成立于 1998 年的海南航空控股有限公司



Its<br>principal business lies in air transportation industry completed with the<br>integration of airport services industry. 其主要业务在于航空运输业, 同时它也完成了机场服务业的整合



After<br>constant expansion，HNA has business<br>in various industries including hotel, tourism, Retail, logistic, financial<br>services and others



经过不断的扩张，海航在各个行业都有业务，包括酒店，旅游，零 售，物流，金融服务等 With the<br>developments lasted more than 2 decades，HNA group has transformed from a 10<br>million state funding Startup into a private enterprise with over a trillion<br>asset 随着 20年的持续发展，海航集团已经从一个 1000 万的国企转变 为拥有超过一万亿资产的私营企业



In<br>2017 HNA was listed NO 170 among the world tops 500 companies ranked by fortune<br>magazine



2017年，海航在“财富”杂志评选的全球 500 强企业中名列第 170 位



There<br>was a figure behind the impetuous expansion of HNA that we must not overlook.<br>That is Wang Qishan



在海航大肆扩张的背后有一个我们不能忽视的人物，他就是王岐山



The<br>first time Wang Qishan working together with Chen Feng. Wang Qishan was the<br>general manager of china rural trust Investment Company



王岐山与陈峰的第一次合作是在他担任中国农村信托投资公司的总 经理。



At<br>that time, Chen Feng resigned from his job In the civil aviation administration<br>in  china ( CAAC) And went to assist Wang<br>Qishan in  china rural trust



那时陈峰辞去了中国民航总局的职务，转投王岐山协助他在中国农 村信托基金的工作。



His<br>primary responsibility was to get funding from the World Bank, Later, Chen Feng<br>granted a 300 million us dollars loan from the World Bank for the procurement<br>project of chemical fertilizer. He often mentioned this anecdote when he had<br>press interviews in the early years 他的主要工作就是申请来之世界银行的。陈峰曾经获得一笔 3 亿美 元的世界银行的贷款用来资助一项化肥采购项目。他早年接受媒体 采访时津津乐道此事。



He<br>also claimed that there was not another subsequent case acquiring load in such<br>way



Owing<br>to that, Chen Feng at the time was quite well-known



他还声称因为这他当时小有名气，因为这之后再没有人以这种方式 获得贷款，



In<br>1998 Hainan officially became a province，The Provincial governor wanted to<br>establish its own airline company 1998 年海南正式成为中国的一个省，当时的省长想成立一家海南 自己的航空公司。



And<br>so he found Chen Feng who was not only graduated from the institute of<br>transport administration He also had working experiences in CAAC，



他找到了陈峰，因为陈峰不仅毕业于运输管理学院，而且还在民航 总局工作过。



It<br>was how Chen Feng became the assistant to the Hainan Provincial governor in the<br>air transport affair office mainly he was responsible for the organization，And establishment of an airline company<br>for Hainan province. 陈峰就这样成为海南省省长的助手 并在航空运输事务办公室任 职，主要负责组织为海南省成立航空公司。



Wang<br>Jian also participated in the preparatory work at the time. Finally in 1993<br>Hainan airline opened up its first air route from Haikou to Beijing.



王建也参与了当时的准备工作。终于在 1993 年，海南航空公司开 通了从海口到北京的第一条航线。



Let’s<br>take a look again at Wang Qishan. The several years subsequent to his departure<br>from china rural trust. He has assumed positions as president of china<br>construction bank. President of people’s bank of china. Member of Guangdong<br>province provincial committee and others。



让我们再来看看王岐山。他离开中国农村信托后的几年。曾担任中 国建设银行行长，中国人民银行主席，广东省委委员等职务。



In<br>2002 he became secretary to the provincial committee of Hainan province。 This is the second time that Wang Qishan<br>crossed path with Chen Feng。  2002 年王岐山成为海南省省委书记，这是王岐山与陈峰人生第二 次的交集。



In<br>the same period of time, under the leadership of Chen Feng and Wang Jian.<br>Hainan airline completed its preparatory work on the organization.



同一时期，在陈峰和王健的领导下。海南航空公司完成了它组织成 立的筹备工作。



Within a year it completed the number of<br>M&A including Haikou Melian international airport. Air chang an, Xinhua airlines<br>and Shan xi airline



一年之内，它完成了包括海口梅联国际机场，长安航空，新华航空 公司和山西航空公司 在内的多项并购活动。



We<br>can also observe along that the development of HNA. And Wang Qishan’s career in<br>the government are closely correlated.



我们还可以发现海航的发展是与王岐山在政府中的职业生涯息息相 关的。



After<br>Wang Qishan left Hainan, he then held the position of mayor of Beijing, he<br>prepared and organized the Beijing Olympics. Soon afterward his career is like<br>a high noon sun.



王岐山离开海南后，他担任了北京市市长，组织并举办了北京奥运 会。从那之后，王岐山的仕途如日中天。



HNA<br>asset value at this point has multiplied. By using different methods like<br>financing expansion, asset and equity mortgage. 这一时期的海航资产通过融资扩张，资产和股权抵押，系统内的资 金流动以及信托和基金融资等方式成倍增长。



Money<br>flow within system and trust and fund financing. The initial $10 million has<br>turned into a total asset value of rmb 55.3 billion at the end of 2009. 由最初的 1000 万美元变成 2009 年底总资产价值人民币 553 亿 元。



This<br>was only the beginning in 2012 Wang Qishan was elected as member of the central<br>politburo standing committee. He was responsible for central committee of<br>discipline inspection. 这只是开始。2012年王岐山当选为中央政治局常委。负责主管中 央纪律检查委员会。



In<br>the following years there were at least 1.2 million of government officials<br>national fallen from their positions. Anti-malfeasant, crime crackdown.<br>Certainly it is necessary within Chinese communist party. 在这之后的几年里，至少有 120 万名政府官员因为男女不正当关 系，涉嫌犯罪而落马。当然，这一切在中国共产党内部看起来是清 党所必须的。



However<br>the anti-corruption campaign led by Wang Qishan without a sound of a sign has<br>turned its course becoming an exclusionary political struggle.



然而，王岐山领导的反腐运动已然成为一场有针对性的党内政治斗 争和对异己的清洗。



Among<br>the fallen officials, there were Zhou Yongkang and Ling Jihua such big time<br>corrupt leaders. And also those who had offended Wang Qishan during the Liu<br>Zhihua investigation。 Their fate is<br>doomed。 在这些落马的官员中，既有周永康和令计划这样的大老虎， 还有 那些在刘志华案调查中得罪王岐山的官员，注定他们也是要被清算 的。



In<br>addition there were Ma Jian previously from ministry of public security and<br>Meng Huiqing from CCDI and others were shuang guied and sentenced successively.



此外还有原公安部部长马健和来自中纪委的孟慧卿等人先后被双规 和判刑。



CCDI<br>under the leadership of Wang Qishan and the ministry of public security under<br>the leadership of Meng Jianzhu worked together like hands in gloves.



这时候王岐山领导下的中纪委和孟建柱领导下的公安部更是左右开 弓密切配合着这场反腐运动。



To<br>say that they have unstrained power is an understatement in the name of<br>anti-corruption.



可以说“纪委加公安，权力大过天”。



Dig<br>up “heicai liao” of political opponents. Plunder possessions, feather their own<br>nests. Rid of any hindrance ahead for the business aligned with self-interest.<br>Green light on policies and funding all the way. They are aptly named True<br>kleptocrats as they cleaned out grafts with grafts, with police. 通过揭底政治对手的所谓“黑材料”，掠夺他们的财产，剿檄对手党 羽，从而为利己的政策和资金流动清除阻碍，大开绿灯。他们名副 其实成为以贪反贪，以警反贪的盗国集团。



Meanwhile<br>HNA’s expansion is undaunted and triumphant. In 2015 HNA total assets has<br>jumped directly up to $ 500 billion. 10 times of $ 50 billion odd that was 6<br>years ago. It has 10 public companies which were either share holding companies<br>or subsidiaries, 与此同时海航的扩张更是一路高歌。 2015 年，海航总资产巨增至 5000 亿美元。这是 6 年前 500 亿资产的 10 倍。拥有 10 家上市控 股公司或子公司。



While<br>Wang Qishan’s position continuously strengthened and solidified. His deterrent<br>force in the official circle mounting.



王岐山的地位也不断加强和巩固，在中共权力高层中的威慑力越来 越大。



HNA’<br>expansion oversees is close to be frantic. We can chart it in simple way from<br>2013 to 2017. From the news describing HNA overseas M&A. we can arrive at a<br>conclusion very easily. 海航的海外扩张更是接近疯狂。我们用从 2013 年到 2017 关于海 航海外并购的的新闻绘制一个简单的图表， 就可以得出这样的结 论。



For<br>instance February 2013 HNA acquired 20% equity interest of a Spanish hotel. May<br>2015 HNA subsidiary acquired 6.2 % equity interest. South African Comair<br>airline with $ 13 million USD. In July RMB 17.5 billion acquired 100% equity<br>interest of a Swiss firm. In September a subsidiary invested $ 2.555 billion<br>USD acquiring an aircraft financial leasing company. In November acquiring<br>23.7% equity interest in Brazil airline with $ 1.05 billion USD. 例如 2013 年 2 月，海航收购了西班牙酒店 20％的股权。 2015 年 5 月，海航子公司收购了南非 Comair 航空公司，价值 1300 万美元 6.2％的股权。7 月，人民币 175 亿元收购了一家瑞士公司的 100％ 股权。 9 月，一家子公司投资 25.55 亿美元收购了一家飞机融资租 赁公司。11 月以 10.5 亿美元收购巴西航空公司 23.7％的股权。



















These<br>HNA M&A abroad happened after Wang Qishan first took up. His position in<br>CCDI.  In the course of 2-3 years. HNA’s<br>M&A abroad also became extravagant and unscrupulous.



我们可以看到这些海航的海外并购是发生在王岐山掌管中纪委之后 的 2-3 年内，并购的规模之大速度之快令人瞠目结舌。



In<br>2016 more than 10 major M&A that were executed or reached consensus.<br>Including in January 18th, HNA acquired the world’s largest IP product.<br>Distributor Ingram micro with $ 6 billion. In April 12th acquired Swiss Arline<br>catering firm with $ 1.5 billion. In July 6th acquired an aircraft financial<br>leasing. Company with $ 1.975 billion in cash. In oct 8th acquired US aircraft<br>financial leasing company with $ 10 billion. In Oct 24th acquired 25% equity<br>interest of Hilton hotel from Blackstone with $ 6.5 billion.



Entering<br>into 2017 HNA impetuous M&A spree has not halted. In January 19th acquired<br>managerial ownership of hedge fund Company funded by scraramucci with $ 200<br>million. In April 3rd acquired 51% of the petroleum storage business from<br>glencore pic with $ 775 million in cash. In may twice increase share holding to<br>9.92%. in Deutsched bank become major shareholder. 在 2016 年，就执行和达成 10多项主要并购交易共识。包括 1 月 18 日，海航完成全球最大的 IP 产品。分销商 ingram micro60 亿美 元的收购。 4 月 12 日以 15亿美元的价格收购瑞士 arline 餐饮公 司。 7 月 6 日收购飞机融资租赁。公司现金 19.75 亿美元。在 8 月 8 日，以 100 亿美元收购了美国飞机融资租赁公司。 10 月 24日， 从黑石集团以 65 亿美元的价格收购了希尔顿酒店 25％的股权。 进 入 2017 年，HNA 大肆的并购狂潮并没有停止。 1 月 19日收购了 由 scraramucci 以 2 亿美元资助的对冲基金公司的管理所有权。 4 月 3 日以 7.57 亿美元现金从 Glencore pic 手中收购了 51％的石油 储存业务。并在两次增持的德意志银行股票份额至 9.92％成为其大 股东。







We<br>only listed the more significant cases. For smaller cases there were countless<br>to be found. 我们这里列举的是那些大事件。小规模的并购案例更不胜枚举。



















After<br>June HNA’s expansion halted abruptly on the contrary, some information showed<br>that even certain M&A projects.  That<br>had reached agreement was also put on hold. In fact international markets<br>started to feel alarmed with way of HNA expansion. 2017 年 6 月海航集团的扩张突然停止，一些达成协议的并购项目 也被搁置了。事实上，国际市场开始对海航扩张的方式感到震惊。



What<br>caused all this to happen?  We need to<br>start looking at the news I exposed. I just mentioned that I started to appear<br>in interviews in January 2017. After close to 6 months’ time, my news breaking<br>and my story captured A lot of attention from the Chinese communities<br>domestically in china and abroad. As well as from the international<br>Medias.



大家想想看造成这一切的原因是什么？这就要从我最初的曝料开始 讲起。我在 2017 年 1 月开始接受采访，在这之后接近 6 个月的时 间里，我的爆料开始被国内外华人以及国际媒体密切关注。



This<br>also pressured the kleptocrats using CCP official media for cleaning work. 这也迫使盗国贼们利用中共官媒进行一系列的洗地宣传。



For<br>examples last year I revealed partially of the flying record of Wang Qishan’s<br>family private jet. In these records there are names of Yao Mingshan and Yao<br>Qing and others, frequently flew together with the senior officers of HNA.



比如我去年透露了王岐山家族私人飞机的飞行记录。这里面有有姚 明姗和姚庆等人经常与海航的高级官员一起飞行的记录。



Moreover<br>after becoming member of CCDI Wang Qishan’s private jet has changed to the<br>Boeing 787 Dreamliner which was purchased. By HNA and the cost to fly is USD 74k per hour. The luxurious customized<br>design of the interior of the aircraft was all done by the family of Wang<br>Qishan. 另外王岐山掌管中纪委后，他的私人飞机也变波音 787 梦想飞机。 这架 787 的飞行成本为每小时 74,000 美元。飞机内部的豪华设计 是由王岐山家族成员私家定制的。



Although<br>from the news on CCTV they described this is a commercial flight not a private<br>jet of any individual.  Anyone can rent<br>it for use.



虽然中央电视台的新闻把这家飞机描述商用而不是私家飞机，声称 何人都可以租用它。















However<br>it showed on the flying record that this 787 aircraft only served the family of<br>Wang Qishan. Why would that be? There was never any record of anyone else<br>renting it using it. Not once. 然而它的飞行记录显示，这架 787 飞机只被用来服务王岐山的家 族。为什么会这样？而且没有任何人使用它租用它的记录， 一次 也没有。



Isn’t<br>it already demonstrated clearly the connection between HNA group and wang<br>qishan and family?



这不是就已经清楚地证明了海航集团与王岐山及其家人之间的联 系？



Not<br>only background information was exposed .July 16th while I was interviewed by<br>the mirror TV. Revealed those who claimed to be “one needs to be hard and tough<br>to be the blacksmith”. And as member of CCDI Wang Qishan in fact an “naked<br>official” 我在 2017 年 7 月 16 号接受明镜电视采访的时候， 就爆料了王岐 山与海航之间的这种关系内幕。王作为中纪委书记，他在内部的讲 话口口声称“打铁还需自身硬”，而他自己却是一位名副其实的裸 官。



I<br>also brought the information to the open such as the names of his family. Yao<br>mingshan, Yao mingduan, Sun fengshan , Sun yao, Liu chengjie and Guan jun and<br>others as well as their us passports，US social security numbers and the addresses of their US residence.



我当时还把王岐山在美国的家人信息公布出来，包括姚明山，姚明 端，孙凤山，孙瑶，刘成杰，贯军等人以及他们的美国护照，美国 社会安全号码和美国居住地址。



In<br>July 17th I revealed the overseas bank account numbers of HNA’s Chen feng.  And Wang jian and others together with the<br>balance carried in those accounts.as well as the connection between HNA and<br>Wang qishan and family.  For that the<br>mysterious shareholding structure of HNA. And the major shareholder Guan Jun<br>surface. 在 7 月 17日视频直播中，我又爆料了海航陈峰，王健等人的海外 银行账号，和这些账号中的资产。以及海航与王岐山和家人之间的



关系。这其中就涉及到海航内部股权中的神秘大股东，他就是贯 君。



It<br>generated great public interest.  July 17<br>the same day I revealed all that German media reported that European central<br>bank regulatory authorities were going to review deutsche bank’s Chinese and<br>Qatar shareholders information.  这次爆料引起公众极大的兴趣。就在 7 月 17号同一天德国媒体报 道欧洲央行监管当局将审查德意志银行的中国和卡塔尔股东信息。



Gradually<br>HNA’s mysterious shareholding structure led to failure in various M&A<br>exercise.  There were even news about<br>being prosecuted for providing false information. While the world is watching,<br>all these became the center of attention.



海航的神秘股权结构的爆料逐渐发酵，最终导致海航各种并购活动 失败。海航甚至被报道称因提供虚假信息而可能被起诉的消息。就 这样海航的一切再一次成为全世界关注的焦点。



In<br>the end HNA issued a written statement. In which it stated that it is a private<br>enterprise. So it has no obligation to disclose shareholding structure. However<br>it respected and agreed with the requirement of information transparency.



最终海航被迫发表了书面声明，声称海航是一家私营企业。因此没 有义务对外披露股权结构。但它尊重并同意信息透明度的要求



HNA<br>reluctantly published its shareholding structure.  This is ci Hang foundation owned more than<br>50% shares.  The remaining 47.5% belonged<br>to 12 natural persons including Chen feng, Wang jian and others.



海航最终非常不情愿地公布了其股权结构。其中慈航基金拥有超过 50％的股份。陈峰，王健等共计 12 人拥有其余的 47.5％的股份。



There<br>were words showed that if any of these shareholders die or leave office.  Their shares would be automatically donated<br>to ci hang foundation. That is to say that Wang jian’s family would not be able<br>to gain a penny from Wang jian’s some 15% shares after his death. 股权协议中还规定了如果这些股东中的任何一方死亡或离职， 他 们持有的股票将自动捐赠给慈航基金。这就意味了王健的家人在其 死后不能从王健拥有的 15％股份中拿到一分一毛.



















On<br>this list the mysterious shareholder Guan jun who owned 30% of HNA shares<br>disappeared. it appears that his 600 billion worth of shares was donated to the<br>US Ci hang foundation.  贯君作为曾经拥有 30％海航股份的一位神秘的股份持有人，他的 名字也竟然从这份公开的名单上消失了。与此同时他拥有的价值 6000 亿的股票被捐赠给了美国慈航基金。



Although<br>I can foresee the course of actions adopted by the kleptocrats. When I saw that<br>they were so blantly openly directly transferred the money to the US. I could<br>hardly contain my rage.



虽然我可以预料到盗贼所采取的行动。但当看到他们如此公然将钱 转移到美国的时候。我几乎无法控制自己的愤怒。



Two<br>days after HNA published that news. I illustrated clearly in detail in my live<br>streaming that why would the kleptocrats want to do that?  Also explained that Ci hang foundation was<br>not a foundation engaging in charity works. It is a private foundation.



海航发布该消息两天后。我在直播视频中详细说明了盗窃贼为什么 想要那样做？还解释了慈航基金并不是用于慈善事业的基金，它只 是一个私人家族基金。



I<br>also revealed that the ultimate beneficiary of the foundation is Wang qishan<br>family trust foundation.  我还指出这个慈航基金的最终受益者是王岐山家族的信托基金。



With<br>the publication of HNA’s shareholder structure. And guan jun’s great shift of<br>tens of billions.  The world learnt of<br>how abnormal the way HNA grew their business. How dangerous to enter into<br>business with HNA.  HNA’s business expansion<br>model I repetition of acquisition, mortgage and loan and then acquisition<br>again. Mortgage again and loan again.



在海航股东结构的公布后，贯君这个神秘的股东悄悄转移了数百亿 股份。世界意识到海航发展业务的方式有多么不正常。与海航集团 开展业务有多大风险。海航的业务扩张模式就是重复收购，抵押和 贷款，然后再次收购。抵押贷款再次贷款。



Once<br>there is no more credibility when it lost trust of international market.  Chain of funding will definitely be broken.<br>It is the fact that after I made the revelation about the connection between<br>HNA and wang qishan. HNA’s frantic overseas expansion ground to a halt.



而海航一旦失去了国际市场的信任它就没有了可信度。资金链肯定 会断裂。事实上，在我揭露了海航与王岐山之间的关系后，海航的 海外疯狂扩张就陷入停滞。



The<br>same fate befallen to Wang Qishan during the 19th national congress that he<br>retired from government completely without any positions ( luo tui).   而王岐山也在19 大以后彻底卸任一切官职。



After<br>Wang qishan’s  luo tui, negative news of<br>HNA slowly came to light. Chain of funding is broken. Significant layoffs,<br>delinquent aviation fuel payment. Rental fee overdue.



王岐山裸退后，海航的负面新闻开始慢慢曝光。资金链断裂，重大 裁员，拖欠航空燃油费，逾期缴纳租金。



All<br>kinds of news came out one after another.  各种坏消息接踵而来。



Ultimately<br>HNA only sell off asset, shares and stocks to cash out. In order to resolve<br>liquidity problem.



最终，海航只能通过出售资产，股权和股票来兑现以解决资金问题 流动。



In<br>January 2018, facing media. Chen feng first time admitted. HNA was confronted<br>with risk because the funding chain was broken. HNA needed to sell off certain<br>relevant assets.  2018 年 1 月，面向媒体陈峰第一次承认。由于资金链断裂，海航 面临风险，需要出售某些相关资产。



HNA<br>from the frantic past that was to buy and buy buy， Changed nowadays it is to carve pieces<br>for mass selling. HNA 从过去疯狂买买买，变成现在抛售资产卖卖卖。



In<br>January 26 HNA sold its office building located in Sydney Australia to<br>blackstone for $250 million Austrian dollars. Between Februarys to march it<br>sold off 3 parcels of land, Hongkong returning $ 22.3 billion Hongkong dollars<br>to the business within a month. In April 24th HNA sold the 26.1% equity in<br>Hilton hotel for $ 5.9 billion.



2018年 1 月 26 日，海航将其位于澳大利亚悉尼的写字楼以 2.5 亿 澳元出售给黑石公司。在 2 月至 3 月期间，它卖掉了香港 3 块土地 向该公司返还了 223 亿港元。 4 月 24 日，海航以 59 亿美元的价格 出售希尔顿酒店 26.1％的股权。



It<br>also reduced its holding of deutsche bank shares in batches. From the height of<br>9.92% reduced to 7.9%. 它还将德意志银行股份从 9.92％减持到7.9％。



It<br>even borrowed from their own employees by sell investment products to them.<br>Even with all these measures, various loan maturity required repayment and high<br>interest rate.



海航甚至通过向他们自己员工出售投资产品来借钱。即使采取了所 有这些措施，海航还是被要求偿还贷款和高额利息。



Still<br>cast a great shadow over HNA. We also witness the kleptocrats taking great pain<br>to protect their own assets.



这一切都成为笼罩着海航的阴影。同时我们还看到盗国贼们竭尽全 力保护自己的资产。



After<br>Wang qishan’s luo tui during the 19th national congress. In the thirteem plenum<br>of the following year. He without any such precedent, was put into the position<br>of the VP. 王岐山在第 19 大裸退后，在次年的十三届人大上史无前例又当选 国家副主席。



Simultaneously<br>he used his own power of influence. So that the 8 major banks would rally for<br>HNA showing that they were willing to assist in the development of HNA. 王岐山再次恢复权力影响的同时，更有 8 大银行发声协助海航发展 并提供支持，帮它度过难关。



Senior<br>level in the CCP also showed the attitude that they would lend a hand in<br>rescuing HNA. Even so would that truly be able to revive HNA?  中共高层也表态愿意伸手拯救海航。



We<br>saw the HNA’s model of expansion. Should we to not ask that where did HNA’s<br>money come from?  We saw Guan jun how<br>easily donated $ 600 billion RMB from china to the US. Should we to not ask<br>that how did they achieve that?



我们看到海航扩张模式的同时，难道不应该问问海航的资金来自哪 里？我们看到贯君如此轻松地将 6000 亿元人民币从中国捐赠到美 国，不应该问问他们是怎么做到的吗？



There<br>are other equally great corporates in china such as wan da and An bang. They<br>met the same problems. Why it was that CCP could be so completely different in<br>their attitudes? 在中国除了海航， 还有像万达和安邦这样大企业，他们遇到了同 样的问题。为什么中共的态度会如此不同？



The answer is if we were just to give them a<br>thought. HNA group frantic expansion and successful career of wang qishan . The<br>concurrency of these two series of events. All these was not a<br>coincidence.



我们想想，海航集团的疯狂扩张和王岐山官场上的成功，看似独立 的两个事件，难道仅仅就是巧合吗？



Just<br>as that my new breaking on Wang qishan and family the HNA group.  Following with the reaction towards HNA group<br>in the international market space. That, was not a coincidence either.  Wang jian being the white gloves (middleman<br>for corruptor) of Wang qishan. Being the forwarding carrier of the assets for<br>the kleptocrats was his death in provence. Truly just a coincidence?  我对王岐山家族和海航集团家族爆料之后， 国际市场也立刻对海 航集团给出反应， 这也绝不是巧合。王健作为帮助王岐山和背后 的盗国贼向海外转移资产的白手套，他在普罗旺斯的惨死，这真的 是一个巧合吗？
