  Well, the virus is now kill more than a hundred people in China and new cases have been confirmed around the world.You need to prepare for and americans to avoid all not essential travel to China.Australia Canada and body and on the list goes on of the officials are investigate ING more than a hundred possible cases in the USA.

  A man has a contract to divorce and we can not let the Japan bus driver and can try to the virus.Has killed more than 100 people there. And in fact it more than forty 500. We have to prepare for the worst always because if you don&#39;t and the worst.War room and m. Here&#39;s your host Stephen cave man. Welcome to the world.I can this is another one of her on going special. The cc PS the Chinese communist parties, Information war against the America.

  So much has been breaking over the last couple of days. Gentleman almost seems like is constant Information war and I&#39;m going to talk about John button.John button the John button book. But I want to go to what&#39;s been happening. R about this Information war, as we know. In my guest r.Or do you get to get the two Jack magazine Jack the book from one America is a good enough to join us Jack the sofa is everybody knows. The watch is so for more intelligent.The officer and fluent in major in we&#39;re going to have later in the show. Miles grow to talk about this. But we are you go.

  Our class book, all these books. It was this kind of March. On Facebook is even admitted you two guys have been at the fore front of what this Information.Now global particular in the United States about the 50 cent army, we saw the Michael pach a long term car log is now gone.On over the voice of American art to clear House. Walk as soon we talk Information world let me start with you and we are good when we talk about Information war, in the context of.

  And respect of warfare, Information economic war and can eat, what we talk about planes to the what&#39;s the first rule of fair. There are rules and.So the Information war rose out everything that we have known in every frame work by which we operate ID with for four decades of no centuries of what we are saying here now.Is an incredible complex and convolution strategy put into place by the Chinese Communist Party and all of its different.Now that those can be media outlets days can be arms length media outlets such as sent as in London where they run things through it can be the digital.

  Side of things the way I are me the 50 cent r me which is real people will pay the time out of money proposed to go and attack certain issues. And we talked about.This war and before and only very recently the Stanford internet observ atory actually came out with the report day to June 17 2020 they should walk through.How the digital before we get to the airport before you can bring a Jack the so big and you probably know as well as anybody you were over in your crayon.For the modern revolution in the streets, you no Information war that was coming from Eastern Europe and from Russia in the whole year of it all back.

  Back in 2012 thirteen. And you just said this is complex compare and contrast what was going on then of which had you know the meeting in the nice day.It&#39;s so worked up about trump and trump campaign and and and each and all that compared to what you&#39;re seeing with the pl a ministry.State security in the ccp today. At the time this goes back to 2013 at the time and I look to what was going on between the European Union.Russia and with you in the middle you had the act of which with the guys who really want to break the rain away from the Russian servant.

  And take it into the European Union. And converse had the administration in you at the time who try to do it at the time. What was going on there seemed very complex and.And and convolution, but actually looking at your seven years later with all of this in my I mean the magnet ride of of complex ity.What I hear is may be a thousand times of us that we can exercise your saying everything you saw in the EU all these issues with your crayon the invasion.Innovation in the different space as it was supposed to be, they were supposed to be so far ahead of the west is so complicated. You&#39;re saying you think this is a thousand times more complex.

  For this way, if you had to have a set of hearing about this like you had hearing about your crayon, the heroes for this and to go through line by line.I think it&#39;s been going on whether it&#39;s media Information, digital Information, real life, this Information, any of that it would take your years of hearing to go through.I want to go to the sorry, but you are in the reason we love having on the show besides that you speak man, your neighbor Intelligence officer. This is your special day. Right? People know you are there at this.Was your special as a professional is for him, right? Is the levels of the station they&#39;ve got in Information warfare a thousand times that we were what we actually saw, what the Russian with.

  People around the rain in this thing that caused the big fire storm in 2016 and beyond. That&#39;s right. So what you&#39;re saying now is a program that is China has.And building for in some cases 10 years now you could go back for the than that even look at the traditional comes to use of propagand a since the 19 20 19 30. But.What you&#39;re seeing is something that I track in the Intelligence community is far back is 20 1020 12, r the first really broke forward this problem.From external with the South China sea issue. And you would see this in the Philip ens you would see this in Malaysia you will see this in Vietnam ut Chinese Information operation.

  Talking about the nine dash wine spreading these pictures around trying to make it seem as though it was norm alized they were at end to normal ize the idea.That this area of international water space was actually part of part of the Chinese sovereign. Of course, not true.They would make it seem as though people in the Philip ens were saying that that make it seems that people in Vietnam were saying that etc at the same time China was flex ING it.National muscles in the United States and in the west primarily from an economic stand point that all so then turned very quickly into an academic.

  B ona campaign, which also focus on propriet ary Information from the business community, as well as from our military on the navy side are number one issue.In terms of SB of cyber and physical was China stealing all of our programs, whether it be for our on vehicle.Whether it be for the rail gun will be for our new some of the class of everything that the us military is putting together. In terms of that I can&#39;t go.Too much in the detail on all of that. But uh let&#39;s just say that if you&#39;ve ever read blind man block the Evil that the summer in the cold war.

  Let&#39;s just say that not much has changed only in stead of the soviet union. Now is the person you guys are both experts in and tea for you also and expert in the mor.Cultural Marks the side of be a Lamb and how these things united is the Chinese Communist Party in what they are doing in their social media platform? Are they.A driving message in global it that also includes and tea for b lm another operations in Europe and beyond. Both over the angle.So one of the things that this Stanford report actually did was going on show not just how the CPU is our own platform domestic.

  Platform is like you tube do that, but also do you things like take talk just for this message and one of the things one of the platform that we&#39;ve been used time and time again throughout this anti fur and b.Lm up rising in recent months is the use of tik Top masters of take talk to spread the message is the other part of it is that over, they actually have this.While Twitter is band in China they have their spoken, whether it&#39;s a global times editor in chief or I&#39;m back to the Chinese ambassador all around the world pushing message into the English.In world into the western world and specifically in recent months and compare ING the Hong Kong democracy protest as to what&#39;s happening with black lives matter and also.

  Thank you. Actually we might even invite black lives matter and tea for representatives to China to have a with us. Also.Its kind of both legitim ising ba lemon tea for 2 a way for a global audience and also attempted to dealer jitter mize Hong Kong democracy protest.I want to get to the two Jack stock of max, you only get a couple of minutes left here, but I want to get to be okay in the Michael pach of it all we&#39;ve had we had voices of distance more money and many others hear about.For long gone the week as the underground House questions to bet on business. President trump historical hasn&#39;t really put people in place have gone and clean out.

  Operation is recorded probably in the first of dnI. The selection of Michael pach how surprising was and how surprising to you who is covered the daily that he stepped in Italy starting at.Well, not only was it&#39;s surprising it was really great to see him going there with the Broad sword and swing it around the office, you know. I mean these are the kind of.But was that we need and one of the things that I love you mentioned Richard green, right? This guy is one of my heroes at this point. And let&#39;s also remember he is the most high.A rang a person of you know, or let&#39;s be a person to be like a cat.

  Be better. You know you want to change that you don&#39;t need la you need to put more guys like Richard green to change the we got about a man is voice of America how important.Is that in using the how important is is using platform is like voice of America and how shock to you as a shock to you as a never laugh sir. That.Shock to you as a novel of the voice of America has been allowed to kind of creep over the kind of having soft ccp program Steven.That&#39;s actually quite shock ING because the voice of America is intended to be the voice of America strategic interests throughout the world. I mean they should be something that doesn&#39;t necessarily strategic communication.

  Yes, and so they shouldn&#39;t necessarily be anything that takes one side political e within the United States whether that the republican democrat which side is to send in us politics. But it should.What they speak to you, s interest, strategic communications around the globe, and should always have that Pro us fast moving forward and stick to whatever the line is the.Is coming out of the state department and not really go far beyond that on the run it shouldn&#39;t be Free Lance ING in there there shouldn&#39;t be taken Broad sides against the American citizens.In some cases or and as we&#39;re now seen again see her can present I wouldn&#39;t expect to see you think they turned you think they turned you never trump. I think there&#39;s been a bias.

  Is the sort of new revolution ary is that have been cree ping in through the number of different institutions in America and since they found the way to be as well you you are an expert in in got your child.In Europe and particularly Eastern Europe and and and the whole conflict between the EU Russia and in in the United Kingdom, radio Free Europe during a good time was at.Absolute central, the hope that you&#39;re ready for Europe with critical time when you have now shift the last couple of years and focus now on the global threat of China. Is it.

  Talking to you to see how soft radio Free Asia and voice of America because of it&#39;s historical man date of what it did as real in the car.Very in call for freedom and democracy and became of the central things that bring down the soviet union will remember that the British Broad casting company was found to.Most the British government&#39;s position both at home and overseas and people knew it as that. Over time is sort of more independent script in you saw.For the BBC become flood in the pen is that everything is of tax for money of course. He can&#39;t have that the baby will never survive commercial it is rely on.

  Contact my money and by the way you can go to jail if you do not pay for television license in the United Kingdom but instead of represent ING what the UK thinks and believe on and having a diverse view point.From all across the United Kingdom of the BBC does is the type a represent London liberal arts and we now seeing that we have now seen that with voice of America as well. One of the things.Is that you have also the national and down for democracy in the United States is another one of these organizations which has been used by the sort of cultural Mark is left. And we have to get our heads around.The fact that at once again, the world is at war with communism, we actually just don&#39;t have the same weapons we have lost when you say culture and markets this the time that we use a lot, what do you mean by that? Because its.

  It sounds like an explosive termin people are saying and of Steve court is getting it not a lit up to day by an post on our books used the terms of cultural market is in relation to be.Nt. This is this is look the belief that the cold war was 1 I believe in in correct reading of history.Was a differ的fight against communism。It was it was a winning the battle not winning the war and cultural Marks and was really the means by which to implement communist idea。And values and destroy a capital ists and market driven economy from the inside, out and that&#39;s what culture of boxes in the show OK we don&#39;t take.

  To take a short commercial break in return miles going to be onto on like this more about the voice of America and also the cc PS Information war against the night.对此。War room. And with Stephen cave and we cannot let this team and hide.

  Yccp, 100% the people in America.在修车吧country America.Now the deep power in the black time you need quickly wake up c CPU.This is the country strategy American strategy one choice. Die and fight back.

  Thank you. Die or fight back OK I want to pick it now. Ii r as I more talk about the study&#39;s goal is going on.OK Twitter YouTube Facebook on and on and they say, hey, you know that smile while his hair is on fire, he&#39;s like Steve is on.If I was something Stanford actually comes out in and us and assessment at least part of this and I want you to give the pull the camera back or give the bigger picture.Give your lesson of Stanford they will bring miles back in. So I want to put the other graphic from Stanford on the if you put the.

  It&#39;s of their right now and you can see the Stanford report. Old sock puppy t&#39;s been covered the yards and analysis of prc at the June 2020.Take them now this is so important I want to this cover again, this is not one American news. This is not Bright park, this is not national post.And this is not warm, this is Stanford university and there the official guys are officially desert to monitor this correct. This is his porn.Official partner observ atory that goes through all of these things and like you say this is just a snap shot, because they actually do this every so often on this occasion they focus on.

  Very limited period of time, but they did it last year as well. I just want to bring out some of the ki critical elements, especially with what the matter was saying that not just about take talk which is.As we know, is controlled by a Chinese company, but also the domestic use of of YouTube Facebook all these other things. Now this the level of interview.And we are saying it makes any quite Russian interference that we saw in 2016 completely look completely like a minute the scale that we&#39;re talking about.It&#39;s completely different. On 11 of June 2020 Twitter announced to take down of a collection of 23750 account, a trip to the people&#39;s republic.

  China with technical indicate is link in the operation to the same to responsible for the network of 200000 accounts previously suspected in August 2019.Remember when they said that Russia inter vene and they said that Russia and to be in the breaks as well they were talking about five hundreds of thousands of account we are talking about.Nearly 250000 and count in this that this will take you many orders of magnet you&#39;d better than what Russia ever did.And that what they ever did relate to trump in 2016, but because the activity here and so we showed on screen a second a girl explain.

  Because the activity here is talk to Hong Kong protest as Taiwan 19 and Moscow, you don&#39;t see this on.And then you don&#39;t see this on c nbc you don&#39;t see on on on the front page of the New York times, but you can go through this your self and I commit this to people to look into because you.She only need to go through about the first six or seven ages to get the full story and then it goes the rest of it is is the evidence behind and you can go into that to. But it&#39;s what to make clear for.The the full cream tea cat is that we see the&#39;s account the see see people account interview is Hong Kong.

  I want 19 and what they could go, go ong square. He saw his green is just a second to go. Now it goes into some and Alice about.How the accounts work, the percentage of that which that he used and what they actually show, and then she goes into a distinction between where the what the Top.Things that it used to spread Chinese this Information. Quote of the Top domain shared by the network YouTube was by far the most share 12005.For the times that is a Google company the same Google that recently set up the China center the same Google whose lead on the China center is now on the.

  This book on the Twitter advise report, excuse me. Most of the other said by the network has a small a audience with the video share in the data set from these channel.What a bout Hong Kong and covered 19 the majority of the content on the small a channels was take talk videos, unbelievable and now I want to go to.I want to turn back the things I haven&#39;t shown you that you might be interested in inside the Stanford report.Yours truly not one of my better ones. Miles I want to bring you in now and this was independent assessment of the guys are hard to do.

  Is at Stanford university the observ atory. They came up with if it&#39;s Hong Kong protest cover 19 a month ago, this was the book, this is coming.The mouse. You&#39;ve been attacked by the sea cp, right? And then the same is the original figure etc. But you see when you actually do the analysis.认识that a big dog of these attacks in this miss Information campaign is target to you. The question with the audience.Take the United States. Mouse, why is the ccp so target ID u, why is it we get about two minutes for you got go to commercial break, but in two minutes.

  I has the sea cp. Target you want social media is so strongly.In the race the and make the report is the best the only one small voice can talk the truth about me about with the movement. I really appreciate.The this report but not the true. CC at the last three years never get one guy is talk to cct the truth.Also never have the one is the people is talk and American with the cct make any the blood to the truth. I before I called you.

  And with you together to have many times. T have the gold tiger take the America. This is ycct worry me.Before in the China I know see see the inside the truth and not just with blue, I know that everything is below.I am inside before no many cp the truth. That&#39;s why for and 99 in the way I talk to America and the voice.忘记删ha of the China and turn in the America can buy a lot of America。

  Make American standard. So this is my school now more the truth. And.Jack ma and in the America how many spy system now how many people.We&#39;re going to take a short commercial break will return in the couple of minutes of miles grow in the rest of the room cc PS war against the America.War room.
