Dear XXXXXXX （收信人名字）




I’m writing to draw your attention to the situation of Mr. Guo Wengui, also known as Miles Guo, and further to express my concern regarding some so-called Chinese dissidents living in<br>the U.S., campaigning against Mr. Guo Wengui, , accusing him of being a Chinese<br>government agent, and his mission here in the U.S. to destroy and disrupt the<br>Chinese democracy movement overseas.





Mr. Guo is a self-exiled Chinese businessman currently living in New<br>York who is seeking asylum in the U.S. and is<br>exposing the corruption of Chinese national figures including Vice President<br>Wang Qishan, President [Xi Jinping's right-hand man](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Only-Wang-Qishan-knew-what-Xi-Jinping-was-going-to-do) and, until last year, his anti-corruption czar.<br>Mr. Guo says he has a wealth of evidence of corruption among China’s state<br>leaders. In early 2017, Guo fired his first<br>salvos against China’s ruling elite through a handful of Chinese-language media<br>outlets based in the United States i.e. Mingjing News and the Voice of America<br>— a live event that was cut short by the producers, leading to speculation that<br>V.O.A. had caved in to Chinese government pressure. In October 2017, The<br>Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, under<br>pressure from China, canceled the first pre-arranged public meeting with Guo<br>Wengui—one day before the event was to be held. David Tell, chief<br>spokesman for Hudson, has acknowledged the institute has been under pressure<br>from China. Tell also said The Hudson Institute website was the target of a<br>major cyber-attack traced to Shanghai. Mr. Guo has released some documents that<br>purport to reveal Beijing’s controversial foreign policies in a news conference<br>last year, including a document that shows<br>orders by China's government to secretly dispatch agents to the U.S. The papers<br>were verified as genuine by, among others, the U.S. Federal Bureau of<br>Investigation.





I’m<br>not surprised to see a barrage of counter accusations which began pouring in<br>against Mr. Guo, mostly published in the pages of the state-run Chinese media.<br>Warrants for his arrest were issued on charges of corruption, bribery and even<br>rape. China asked Interpol to issue a Red Notice calling for Guo’s arrest and<br>extradition. He was running out of money, it was reported. In September 2017,<br>two of Guo’s former employees had been detained, and their family members were<br>threatening suicide. Two of his brothers and his niece had been prosecuted and<br>sentenced since then. The CCP government has also filed criminal<br>charges against him in the U.S. that were politically motivated and requested<br>American authorities to cancel his visa.


However, what astonishes me is that there are so called Chinese<br>dissidents, people who might seem<br>like Guo’s natural allies who,<br>instead of supporting Mr. Guo, are posting fake documents and video clips which were produced and used by<br>the CCP government, trying to smear Mr. Guo and sabotage his application for political asylum. These<br>so-called Chinese dissidents, are the receivers of The National Endowment for<br>Democracy (NED) funds. There is evidence showing that some of these people are lawyers, paralegals, interpreters and<br>even church volunteers. They are helping hundreds of Chinese immigrants apply for<br>asylum using false tales of persecution, for financial profit.





Finally, I and those like me, appeal to you to support our desire for<br>liberty, rule of law, and freedom of expression in China, by supporting Mr. Guo<br>Wengui, a genuine fighter for our cause.





Your sincerely,





XXXXXXXXXXXX （你的名字）
