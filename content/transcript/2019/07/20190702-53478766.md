I like this.

  Beautiful summer afternoon in Washington DC the thunder storm come on the.So just about every day we have a like this.This is what happens when the rise as it was 95 year.哦。

  This is a part in the White House.This is freedom.现在因为他China the.We have a big river in the middle of.

  It is the first Chinese in America. First time is that is the famous people in the finger in the public.People when is the in the social media time is it it&#39;s a federal court in the United States of America.That is right or not. County court they&#39;re not state courts are not a little city court of course this is the highest.The best is the best rules of the beginning is pretty.

  I would like to have that every day.Every body talk you need you can not too much for some people in the family. You know in the.Sorry and family in the black. Just because my reputation of the dark.But today is I was caught in my recommendation. Federal.

  I don&#39;t think people appreciate raising the level of making your public figure for you know any politicians.We hear that love was very hard the same to you, particularly the beauty of this day with my House that the first moment is.Now for the United States are you can say a lot of stuff about any person we have strong like right there. And that&#39;s where there is there are there you have.O just as saying you know everybody the White House is the bush Obama every day the so we believe in the freedom of.

  If people believe that the Chinese ccpI would allow this to happen in Hong Kong they would have你。The white Hong Kong is the people look at the west side. You know what the opinion.For the Chinese people to have the rule of law was the right the greatest of you have the Chinese people rule of law with the Singapore Taiwan.On the United States there, but they need to rule the other is just wrong of the week. I really really.

  To the honor is always the system is the jury of your fears that bass e get someone by the court and around of thing every.Y can have it from the highest to the lowest everybody to cities and goes into the pool. You sit there and then you selected you have people to you know about different.Wipe the race is religion, gender, sexual presence. That&#39;s that&#39;s what the American system is that it&#39;s what the kids in Hong Kong or fighting.They don&#39;t want I want they don&#39;t want to black hand of the day we make up the they want to be the.

  Two days ago we have broken in the in the new, everybody say why? Every time is the 3rd.王岐山。You have to come to federal.
