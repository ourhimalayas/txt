***The #FakeNews Will Not Report This***

**For CHINA, Is<br>GUO Wengui More Important Than A State Level Ally?**

***TIBET & the DALAI<br>LAMA***

In Dec 2013, as instructed by MENG Jianzhu(then Head of CCP<br>Police Force), GUO Wengui, as an intermediary, using his connections arranged a<br>Television interview to the Dalai Lama by Chief Reporter (ZHENG Hao) from<br>Phoenix TV (Japan Branch). The videoclip of the interview was submitted to<br>President XI Jinping afterwards.

*(Note:<br>Phoenix TV is de facto being controlled by MENG Jianzhu and other CCP Ruling<br>elites, therefore, its reporters are essentially CCP agents and/or Spyies).*

Together with this interview, the Dalai Lama himself wrote a<br>letter to XI Jinping, in which the Dalai Lama has re-iterated and/or clarified<br>his views as regarding Tibet since 1979, which are


1.      The Dalai Lama has ***given up the pursuit of Tibet<br>Independence since 1974***, since then been seeking he has been seeking<br>Autonomy of Tibet within the frame of Chinese Constitution;


2.      Confirmation and Clarification that Dalai Lama<br>hasn’t use the ***concept of the “BIG Tibet***” (the alleged “Big Tibet” is inclusive<br>of huge areas in the Provinces of Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai and probably Yunnan,<br>which is almost double the area of Tibet).


3.      The Dalai Lama has NEVER raised the request of “***High<br>Degree of Autonomy***” in Tibet;


4.      (the Dalai Lama’s) Seeking Tibet’s Independence<br>and (afterwards) Deportation of Han Chinese ***thru “the third way (or the<br>middle approach, raised by the Dalai Lama since 1979 since DENG Xiaoping Era)***”<br>is ungrounded allegations;


5.      Whether Dalai Lama would reincarnate or not,<br>should be decided by Tibetans;


6.      The Dalai Lama ***doesn’t recognize and would not<br>support self-burnings*** committed by Tibetans;

The letter was prepared in Duplicate, one copy was kept by<br>GUO Wengui. Once received the letter from GUO Wengui, MENG Jianzhu told GUO<br>Wengui, that (we) won’t allow him to return by all means, GUO would receive<br>top, State Reward if GUO “has the ‘Fucking Monk’(秃驴) killed”.

***The disclosed videoclip of Dalai Lama’s Interview by Phoenix, together<br>with the Dalai Lama’s letter to XI Jinping, clearly shows that CCP has been<br>lying to the whole world for decades, including Tibetans in China, blaming that<br>Dalai Lama is the obstacle of the Tibet issue – seeking Tibet Independence and<br>encouraging Tibetan self-burning sacrifices.***


***NORTH KOREA, KIM JUNG UN REGIME & GUO WENGUI***

On May 21, 2017, in Elliot Broidy email (GUO Wengui<br>disclosed the retyped email with Chinese translation during the livestreaming)<br>to then Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in the name of “Improve Law Enforcement<br>Relations between the US and China”, China would cooperate “to deliver major<br>assistance with regard to North Korea”, for example, bank accounts and assets<br>of Kim Jong-Un and many of his family members in Macau and China. In return,<br>the US need to extradite GUO Wengui, a fugitive Chinese billionaire who was<br>waging a war against CCP.

In July 2017, when SUN Lijun, then vice minister of CCP<br>Public Security, was visiting the US, the abovementioned bank accounts and<br>assets info were provided, the biologic information of Kim Jong-Un was<br>requested by the US. In the following CHINA visits made by Kim Jong-Un, the<br>biologic information (inclusive of finger print) of Kim Jong-Un and his<br>retinues were acquired and then submitted to the US. In Sept. 2018, more<br>information about Kim Jong-Un was provided to the US.

Doing all of these, plus many more $ that they are willing<br>to pay, the ruling elites of CCP the CCP, or to be more specifically, CCP<br>kleptocrats, have only ONE request – revoke of GUO Wengui’s Visa and sending<br>him back to CHINA.

In another words, CCP ruling elites (Gang of WANG Qishan)<br>would rather sell North Korea(its closest state ally) out for the return of a<br>single person – GUO Wengui, the CCP’s biggest opponent of the world.


***DOWN OF HONG KONG and “One-Country, Two System”***

***CCP Law Enforcement in Hong Kong (illegal)***

In about July 2017, CCP Central National Security Council<br>released a series of highly confidential directions (GUO Wengui disclosed at<br>least 2 original documents during the livestreaming) to Ministry of Public<br>Security, Ministry of National Security and CCP Hong Kong and Macau Affair<br>Office (HMO), to suppress Anti-CCP movements in Hong Kong. To facilitate this (illegal)initiative:


1.      National Security law enforcement personnel<br>would be sent to Hong Kong/Macau;


2.      These national security personnel’s presence in<br>Hong Kong/Macau should be HIGHLY confidential (therefore, no entry/exit records<br>at borders? Therefore, kidnapping of “suspects” and transferring to mainland<br>would not be recorded, no mention reported?).


3.      HMO need to “supervise” Government of HKSAR to<br>make it happening;


4.      Any law enforcement staff of HKSAR does not<br>fully cooperate with this (illegal initiative), should receive appropriate<br>warning, transfer to other department, removal from duties and, “in case of<br>serious situation”, criminal charges as punishment to send strong signals to<br>others;


5.      Target of this initiatives were those<br>“participated illegal organization in the past 5 years” and “participated in<br>major anti-CCP events, such as ‘9.28 Occupation of Central’”.


***Establish CCP Economic Dominance in Hong Kong – Business is Politics***

In 2017, The CCP General Office released a direction (File<br>Number 2017- 039), clearly indicated that all parties should work together to<br>make sure Chinese Companies (especially state-owned-enterprises) can establish<br>economic dominance in Hong Kong.

Given the fact that the Chief Executive of HKSAR is under<br>the supervision of HMO and its branch in Hong Kong (LOCPG – Liaison Office of<br>the Central People’s Government in HKSAR), there is no surprise that the<br>government of HKSAR will spare no efforts on this initiative.


***INTERVENTION & INFILTRATION OF TAIWAN POLITICS***

Jan 2016, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the general<br>election, CCP established a special team to evaluate DPP’s stands with regards<br>to “1992 Consensus” and approaches of handling Taiwan Independence issue from<br>May 20, 2016 to May 21, 2017.

During the livestreaming, GUO Wengui released one classified<br>document and decided to put the rest 2 documents on-hold (after receiving<br>information from others?). However, below factual information disclosed by GUO<br>Wengui are far beyond shocking.

1.      CCP or CCP elites doesn’t worry about MA<br>Ying-jeou, instead, it worries more about Tsai Ing-wen with regard the<br>acknowledgement of “1992 Consensus”. (Has MA Ying-jeou been compromised by CCP<br>already?)


2.      Most of the Kuomintang (KMT) (senior) officials<br>have been compromised (BGYed) by CCP, they are acting as what CCP requests;


3.      A big team of CCP special (secret) personnel<br>were send to Taiwan by May 19, 2017, in a bid to conduct its BGY campaign<br>toward DPP officials.
