8/3/2022 Miles Guo: Intelligence will lose its value and become useless if it is used at a wrong time; The U.S. military is not almighty, and there are so many factors the U.S. has to consider prior to forming a military alliance with Japan and Australia in order to jointly project Taiwan; If the Taiwanese military can hold out for three hours against the invasion, Taiwan will be winning; if they can further attack back the CCP by firing missiles at the places outlined on the map we provide, Taiwan will be winning for sure!

8/3/2022 文贵直播：如果情报在不恰当的时间被使用就会失去它的价值而无用武之地；美军并非全能，和日本、澳大利亚形成军事同盟保护台湾要考虑许多因素；若台军在开战后能坚持三小时就会赢，如果能进一步按我们提供的地图袭击中共的目标，那就赢定了。
