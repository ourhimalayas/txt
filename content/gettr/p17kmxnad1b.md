4/28/2022 Miles Guo: When you come abroad, you should not keep the same way of thinking as you were in Communist China. Speculation will cost you a lot; the disasters of 2022 and 2023 will be even more tragic than what happened in Wuhan and Shanghai. Be prepared for the worst moment to come!

4/28/2022 文贵直播: 人在海外就不要心在中共国，投机会令你损失惨重；2022和2023年的灾难会比武汉和上海发生的悲剧更为惨烈。要做好最坏时刻到来的准备！
