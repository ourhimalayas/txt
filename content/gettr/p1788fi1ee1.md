4/26/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The Chinese Communist Party believes that the Chinese people have a tremendous amount of resilience and tendency to forget. So, the CCP has got ready for its long-term plan to let the Chinese people live like the North Koreans, living a life that’s worse than an animal’s. As long as the CCP still exists, there will be only two tiers in China - the imperial tier and the slave tier. I hope our fellow Chinese take good care of yourselves and deal with the upcoming disasters in a sensible way. Only the New Federal State of China can bring you hopes, opportunities, and dignities.

4/26/2022 文贵盖特：共产党深信中国人的耐性和忘性无限大，所以中共已做好让中国进入北朝鲜模式、让中国人长期活在猪狗不如的生活中的准备；只要中共存在，中国只有皇级和奴隶极；希望国内的同胞们照顾好自己，理性看待未来的灾难，唯有新中国联邦能带来希望、机会与尊严
