7/22/2022 Miles Guo: For the first time in the US, the judge considered the trustee and his law firm separately in terms of whether the trustee has conflicts of interest at yesterday's court hearing. The judge will decide whether or not to grant our request for a discovery regarding Ms. Holley Claiborn and to approve Luc Despins as the trustee at the court session on August 1st. In response, we can take a series of actions such as appealing or filing new motions.

7/22/2022 文贵直播：昨天的庭审中，美国首次有法官就受托人是否有利益冲突的问题上，把受托人及其所在的律所分开考虑！法官将在8月1日的开庭中再决定是否同意我方要求的对Holley女士的调查以及是否批准卢克为受托人；对此，我方可以采取上诉或发起新动议等一系列行动
