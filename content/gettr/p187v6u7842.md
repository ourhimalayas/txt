5/3/2022 Miles Guo: The very first thing that the Whistleblowers' Movement should do is to oppose the cult of personality, which is the foundation of the dictatorship's propaganda, brainwashing, and fabrication of lies and heresies. May 3, 1991 was the day I was released from the Qingfeng Detention Center. I am a human being rather than a god. Without the people in these old photos, I wouldn’t have been who I am today.

5/3/2022 文贵直播：爆料革命要做的第一件事就是反对个人崇拜，独裁的宣传洗脑和编造邪说的基础就是个人崇拜；1991年5月3日是文贵离开清丰看守所的日子；文贵是人而不是神，没有这些老照片上的人，就没有今天的文贵
