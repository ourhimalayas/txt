7/24/2022 Miles Guo: The fact that the SEC regulates Coinbase and has categorized 9 crypto assets as securities is great news for the Himalaya Exchange, which serves as the reference for the world's regulatory authorities. Unlike other crypto exchanges that are speculative, non-compliant, risk-taking, and bogus, the Himalaya Exchange and the Himalaya Coin are the cleanest, most compliant, and most secure in the world.

7/24/2022 文贵直播：美国证监会(SEC)对Coinbase监管并将9种加密资产认定为证券，这对喜联储是天大的好事；喜联储是全球监管机构的参考标准，而其他数字货币交易所的投机、违规、冒险和虚假，反衬出喜联储和喜币是全球最干净、最合规、最安全的！
