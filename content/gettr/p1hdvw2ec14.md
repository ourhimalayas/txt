1 billion population data leaked means the critical moment to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) 
A hacker recently claimed to have acquired more than 23 TB data from Shanghai public security system, including sensitive personal information of one billion citizens, billions of police reports and other information.
On July 5th, Miles said: Regarding the CCP's data stolen by hackers, the content and its meanings are extremely important. Fellow fighters shall examine them carefully to own the weapon to eliminate the CCP. Someone in Hainan told Miles that Zeng Qinghong was in bad shape. Miles responded that you should not underestimate Zeng but have more contact with him. Zeng, Wang, Meng, Jiang will surely destroy Xi, resulting in the elimination of the CCP.
