7/28/2022 Miles Guo's GETTR: Fu Zhenghua stands trial in a court in Northeast China, but the trial is not open to the public. Why is that? Fu Zhenghua was so arrogant back then, he wanted to destroy me and my whole family. Even now he is still manipulating the CCP. No one can exemplify the CCP better than he does!

7/28/2022 文贵盖特：傅政华案在东北开庭为什么不敢公开审理？傅政华当时多狂啊，不但要灭了文贵全家，直到现在还能把共产党玩得团团转，不愧为共产党的最佳代表!
