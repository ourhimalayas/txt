7/14/2022 Miles Guo: Every year the CCP spends $30 billion, or even hundreds of billions of dollars on attorney fees in the U.S., so that they could attract the senior officials of NASDAQ and DOJ to work for big law firms, which are the best channel for the CCP to infiltrate the U.S. DOJ. The trustee replacement incident will expose the evil backstage manipulator in the DOJ, as well as all the corrupt organizations in the U.S. that have been colluding with the CCP!

7/14/2022 文贵直播：中共在美国每年付300亿甚至上千亿美元律师费，以此吸引了美国纳斯达克、司法部的高官纷纷下海到律师事务所工作，这是中共打入美国司法部的一个最好桥梁。更换受托人一案把美国司法部的幕后黑手和黑组织都亮了出来！
