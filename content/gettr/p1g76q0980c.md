6/28/2022 Miles Guo: Even if the HK dollar decoupled with the US dollar, it would be possible for Hong Kong to have a "rebound". Because Hong Kong facilitates the CCP's money laundry and wealth storage, bridging the communication between the CCP and the rest of the world. The CCP is seeking advice from people around the world to revive the economies of Hong Kong and the mainland. However, please keep these two points in mind: 1) whoever didn't take the COVID shots are going to be the winners; and 2) because of the Whistleblowers' Movement and me, the CCP will be eliminated for sure.

6/28/2022 文贵直播：即使港币和美元脱钩，香港还有可能进入“小阳春”，因为香港有助于中共洗钱藏钱且是其对外沟通的桥梁；中共正在世界各地找人支招以重振香港和内地的经济；但请大家记住两点：1）没打疫苗就是人生赢家 2）因为有爆料革命和文贵，中共一定会消失！
