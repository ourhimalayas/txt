6/10/2022 Miles Guo: As for the money we spent on the delicious food and fancy drinks enjoyed by the fellow fighters at the celebration of the 2nd anniversary of the New Federal State of China, not a dime came from Communist China. This shows that we can live much better without the CCP! I was able to attend our celebration on site, meaning that I not only can let go of the safety of my life, but I also put my trust in the fellow fighters above all else, and I believe I can handle the situation.

6/10/2022 文贵直播：战友们在新中国联邦两周年庆典上享受的美食和美酒没有一分钱来自中共国，这说明没了中共，我们能活得更好！文贵能到场意味着文贵不仅是能放下自己生命的安危，而且文贵对战友的信任高于一切，并相信自己能控制住局面
