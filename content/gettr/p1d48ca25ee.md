6/7/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The Taiwanese, Japanese, and other foreign businesspersons who set up factories in Qingdao, Shanghai, Henan, and other places have recently experienced the same tricks of the CCP - first, the CCP would ingratiate itself with them and persuade them not to withdraw their factories, and then the CCP would threaten them. You will be treated like their grandpa when the CCP wants to take advantage of you, and you will be taken out when they no longer use you. Can you trust the CCP’s words?

6/7/2022 文贵盖特：在青岛、上海、河南等地开厂的台商、日商和外商最近都经历了中共同样的套路 - 先跪舔求他们不撤走、再威胁；用你的时候你是爷爷，不用就弄死你，中共的话能信吗？
