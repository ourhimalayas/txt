【Miles Grand Live】6/22/2022: The case of Beijing International Trust is a big deal, which is like what had happened to the Ping An Group back then. The shareholders of Beijing International Trust are either the Standing Committee members of the CCP's Beijing Municipal Committee or the members of the CCP's Politburo Standing Committee. Wang Qishan has been manipulating Beijing International Trust, which ended up in his own hands. Wang has hundreds of billions of dollars in guarantees that have not yet gone bust. No wonder Wang Qishan has the nickname "Guiziliu" (a cunning and wicked guy).

【文贵大直播】6/22/2022：北京信托的事之大，相当于当年的平安集团；北京信托的股东不是北京市委常委就是中央政治局常委；王岐山玩弄北京信托，玩来玩去最后回到了他自己手上，他还玩了几千亿美元的担保却还没暴雷，不愧是鬼子六！
