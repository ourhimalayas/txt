8/82022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: No one in the CCP dares to mention my name, because they don’t want the West to know what a big threat the Whistleblowers’ Movement and the New Federal State of China is to the CCP; our fellow fighters within Communist China should learn to protect themselves and try to avoid unnecessary detainment; what our fellow fighters have done make me feel that all my endeavor is worthwhile!

8/8/2022 文贵盖特：中共内部无人敢提文贵的名字，因为他们不想让西方知道爆料革命和新中国联邦对中共的巨大威胁；国内的战友要学会保护自己、避免无谓的被抓；战友们让文贵感到一切付出都是值得的！
