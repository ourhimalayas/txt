6/3/2022 Miles Guo: If the CCP exists, China will eventually break into many independent territories, followed by refugee crisis and famine; only when the CCP is taken down and a federalism system is established in China, will Chinese people be able to create their own wealth and civilization, and live in peace with the rest of the world; a federalism China will best suit the interest of the US, and will be best prospect for Chinese people and the world.

6/3/2022 文贵直播：如果中共不灭，中国将四分五裂并导致饥荒和难民潮；只有消灭共产党，建立联邦制，中国人才能真正创造自己的文明和财富，并与世界和平共处；联邦制的中国最符合美国的利益，也是中国人和全世界最好的希望。
