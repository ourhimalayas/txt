6/9/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: More family members of our fellow fighters inside Communist China have been diagnosed of cancer due the COVID vaccines; In a small county near Wenzhou, the “white guards” could beat up anyone they wanted, and even a kid was not spared; In Shanghai during the lockdown, some families had to kill their pet dogs to feed themselves. Yet the CCP claimed that the Shanghainese voluntarily quarantined themselves; I probably know the true nature of the CCP better than anyone else in the world, but I still underestimated the evilness of the CCP!

6/9/2022 文贵盖特：更多国内战友的家人因为打疫苗患癌；在温州的小县城，大白随便打人，连孩子都不放过；上海隔离的家庭因为没吃的杀了自己的宠物狗充饥，而中共却谎称他们是自愿隔离；文贵自以为是最了解中共的人，却仍然低估了共产党的邪恶！
