8/2/2022 Miles Guo: In all the events happening around the world including Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, the NFSC people have been playing a critical role in them as unsung heroes. The successful landing of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in Taiwan and her coming meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen has unveiled the CCP’s true face of a paper tiger. Taiwan concern is no longer a Chinese internal affair as what the CCP has claimed, and it has indeed become an international matter. Right at this moment, the demise of the CCP is announced.

8/2/2022  文贵直播：当前世界发生的各种大事，包括佩洛西访台，新中国联邦人都是幕后英雄。佩洛西议长成功落地台湾且即将和蔡英文总统的会面已将中共打回纸老虎的原型，台湾问题不再是中共声称的内政，而是实实在在的世界问题。这一刻，中共已被宣布灭亡！
