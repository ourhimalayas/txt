8/5/2022 Miles Guo: If the U.S. and Europe fail to take the initiative to decouple from the CCP in the areas of technology, finance and internet, they will be unable to protect themselves once the economic meltdown takes place. The only option left for the U.S. and the West is to fight back by cutting off the economic ties with the CCP while carrying out military operations to destroy the CCP, otherwise, the U.S. and the West will suffer tremendously.

8/5/2022  文贵直播：如果美国和欧洲在科技、金融、互联网等各领域不主动与中共脱钩，一旦经济危机迅速爆发，它们将无法防范。当下美国和西方的唯一选择是反击，在经济上和中共彻底切割的同时，在军事上实施消灭式打击。若不这样做，美国和西方将面临着巨大灾难。
