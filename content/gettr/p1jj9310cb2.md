7/23/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP kleptocrats have spent the hard-earned money of the Chinese Lao Baixing purchasing properties in Manhattan, which is the most expensive place in the world. The average monthly property management fees for a property equals the total of the incomes of dozens of Chinese people. The people’s lives are regarded as worthless in Communist China, and the CCP is so cruel that it does not allow the Chinese people to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the 2021 floods in Henan.

7/23/2022 文贵直播：中共盗国贼们用老百姓的血汗钱在全世界最繁华的曼哈顿买房置产，他们一个月的物业管理费是几十个老百姓一年收入的总和！在中共国人命轻如鸿毛，中共冷血到甚至不允许人们悼念2021年在河南水灾中丧生的人。
