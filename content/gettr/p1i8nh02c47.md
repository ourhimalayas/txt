7/13/2022 Miles Guo: Paul Hastings has set off a shock wave across the US media, judicial community, and the political arena. The strategy of the Whistleblowers’ Movement to take down the CCP by the United States, by Law, and by the CCP itself has been fully played out in the trustee appointment for my bankruptcy case. Paul Hastings’ conflicts of interest have nothing to do with how much revenue was generated from their representing PAG. The recordings of the hearings held by Hon. Manning, and the documents of O’Melveny and Paul Hastings are the best evidence.

7/13/2022 文贵直播：普衡这次在美国媒体、司法界、政治体系掀起了惊涛骇浪；爆料革命的以美灭共、以法灭共、以共灭共之策略在普衡受托人一案中得到了充分体现；普衡的利益冲突跟它从PAG获得的收入无关；曼宁法官听证会的录音、美迈斯律所和普衡律所的文件是最好的证据
