7/3/2022 Miles Guo: The essence of the 20th Party Congress is that Xi is going to stay in power, and this is why it should be called "the 20th demise of the CCP". The CCP's 20th Party Congress was already doomed during the 19th Party Congress, and Zeng Qinghong said, "From today onwards, there will be no more CCP". Meng Jianzhu declined Xi's offer of the position of the Honorary Vice President, so he was considered anti-Xi and was arrested. Xi himself announced that 5 million CCP members had been thrown to jail.

7/3/2022 文贵直播：20大就是习的连任，叫"中共的第20次灭亡"；中共20大早在开19大的时候就已没了！曾庆红说: "从即日起, 再无共产党 ！" ；孟建柱未接受习给他的名誉副主席的职位，因此被认为反习被抓；习自己宣布已抓了500万党员！
