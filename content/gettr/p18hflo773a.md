5/5/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: As long a s the CCP still exists, the Sino-US relationship will never improve. Only by destroying the CCP can the economy of the US and the West sustain. The Americans’ talk of canceling the tariffs imposed on the CCP is based on its internal political and economic concerns. The economic collapse, the enslavement of the CCP’s devilish regime, and the disasters caused by the CCP virus and COVID vaccines are the three major threats to the Chinese people, who have no choice but to take down the CCP.

5/5/2022 文贵盖特：只要中共存在，中美关系永远不可能好；只有消灭中共，美国及西方的经济才能撑下去；美国说要取消对中共征收的关税是基于其内部政治和经济的考量；经济崩溃，中共魔鬼政权的奴役以及病毒、疫苗灾难是压在中国人头上的三座大山，除了灭共，别无选择
