7/31/2022 Miles Guo: Communist China has 3 approaches for the so-called development of its own chip industry: forming joint ventures, relying on the state and military intelligence authorities to steal technologies, and through the so-called M&A and investment deals. Massive infiltration, BYG schemes, stealing, seizing and cheating are always involved. However due to bribery and kickbacks, most of the investment money was embezzled and the products are built with poor quality.

7/31/2022 文贵直播：中共国芯片产业的三个发展方向无外乎通过所谓的中外合资、国家级和军事级情报部门，和所谓的并购和投资进行大量的渗透、蓝金黄和偷抢骗，但最后因为回扣和行贿，钱都打水漂了，做出的产品偷工减料。
