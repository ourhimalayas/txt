5/11/2022 Miles Guo: The Russians are very clear that Putin's invasion of Ukraine only suits the interest of very few people, and the majority of them are victims of the war. Therefore Putin dares not to take the war to an extreme; In Communist China, things will go just the opposite. Too many Chinese people have been brainwashed and will support Xi's insane actions; the recent rumor that Xi will step down is a “lure the snake out of hide” trick played by Xi, which is exactly the same trick played by Mao Zedong before launching the Cultural Revolution.

5/11/2022 文贵直播：俄罗斯人民很清楚，普京侵略乌克兰只符合极少数人的利益，绝大多数人是受害者，因此普京不敢走极端；在中共国刚好相反，太多被洗脑的中国人会支持习近平做出疯狂举动；近期所谓习要让位的谣言是习自演自导的“引蛇出洞”，和当年毛泽东发动文革前做的事如出一辙。
