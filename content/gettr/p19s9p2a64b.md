5/14/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: At least $7 trillion has recently vanished in the US financial markets. People should not be too greedy and must have the fundamental capabilities to tell true from false and to discern good from evil. Sisters and brothers, please hold on and calm down! The manufacturers and suppliers of the top five Italian luxury brands want to become the manufacturers for GFashion, and there are even more manufacturers that want to work with GFashion. Because they are optimistic about the potentially huge market of the New Federal State of China and our righteous belief and cause to take down the CCP!

5/14/2022 文贵盖特：美国金融市场最近蒸发了至少7万亿美元！人不要太贪心，要有基本的辨别真假、善恶的能力！兄弟姐妹们请搂住！意大利前五大奢侈品牌的厂家都要给GFashion生产，还有更多的厂家要和GFashion合作，因为看好新中国联邦潜在的巨大市场和灭共的正义情怀与事业
