7/3/2022 Miles Guo: The legal system in the US is not absolutely fair, but it gives everyone a chance to speak; however in Communist China, have you seen any of the 5 million detained CCP members able to speak up? Therefore I am confident of the fairness of trials in the US court, and those attempting to bring me down with frivolous lawsuits will be punished in the end!

7/3/2022 文贵直播：美国的法律虽不能做到完全公正，但至少每个人都有说话的机会；反观中共国，那些被抓的500万党员有一个人能发声吗？所以文贵坚信在美国法庭一定能得到公正的判决，而那些用法律缠诉、陷害文贵的人最终将受到惩罚！
