7/8/2022 Miles Guo: The Chinese people who have been enslaved under the CCP's rule are so ignorant and pathetic that they would burst into tears and fall to their knees to show gratitude to the kleptocrats such as Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji. Those who cheered for the death of Shinzo Abe shall be punished by God!

7/8/2022 文贵直播：中共统治下被奴化的中国人无知可悲到了何等地步？居然见了江泽民、朱镕基这等盗国贼都会感激涕零、屈膝致谢；那些为安倍之死而狂欢的人将遭天谴！
