7/13/2022 Miles Guo: It's said that various countries have made it clear to the U.S. that they would continue showing courtesy to the CCP politically and defraud the CCP economically. Many major banks around the world are trying to isolate themselves from the financial notes issued by the CCP banks. Bridgewater, Blackstone, Goldman Sachs, and others are divesting from Communist China. Our fellow fighters should understand that, if we do not take down the CCP, everything will be unrealistic.

7/13/2022 文贵直播：据说最近很多国家都在向美国表态，说会继续对中共实行一手哄一手骗的政策；全世界各大银行都在试图跟中共银行开具的票据隔离，桥水、黑石、高盛等也在从中共国撤资；战友们不要天真，不灭掉共产党，一切都是虚妄！
