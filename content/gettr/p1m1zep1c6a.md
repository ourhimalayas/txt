8/10/2022 Miles Guo: Someone recently had dinner with Xi Jinping's daughter, and asked her about COVID vaccines. Xi's daughter said the CCP government never mandated anyone to take COVID vaccines. According to her, the rise of sudden death, particularly in young people, certainly is related to COVID vaccines. Xi's daughter also confirmed that her dad did not take the COVID vaccine, nor did any Party and state leaders.
