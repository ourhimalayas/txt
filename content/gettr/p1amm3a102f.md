5/19/2022 Miles Guo: Hu Jintao and Zeng Qinghong suggested that Xi could keep being the President of PRC, but he would have to step down from his position as the General Secretary of the CCP, with Li Keqing and Wang Yang being proposed as the candidates. Although this can lead to infighting in the CCP, whoever takes power will not change the CCP at all. What we seek to take down is not just the CCP, but also the CCP's system. The CCP is going to wage a war, and the most important thing is to make sure fellow fighters and their families in Communist China can have enough food.

5/19/2022 文贵直播：胡锦涛和曾庆红称习可继续当国家主席，但要让出总书记的位子，并提议李克强和汪洋为人选；这虽将引发中共内斗，但不论谁上台都还是共产党，我们要灭的不仅是共产党，而且是中共的体制！中共要打仗了，确保国内战友和家人有足够粮食是最重要的
