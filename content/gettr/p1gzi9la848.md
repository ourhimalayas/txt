7/3/2022 Miles Guo: Whether it is the 1st or the 20th Party Congress, the aim of the CCP in holding these meetings is to abuse the 1.4 billion slaves and make sure its absolute centralization of power. The Tiananmen Square protests started in December 1988, and the most critical period was March, April, and May 1989. Its essence was that Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang wanted to challenge Deng Xiaoping's authority. All those who were slaughtered by the CCP in the June 4th Massacre were the victims of the CCP's power struggles!

7/3/2022 文贵直播：不论是一大还是20大，共产党开这些会的目的都是要虐待14亿奴隶并保证权力绝对统一；六四学运始于1988年12月，最关键的是1989年3、4、5月，其本质是胡耀邦、赵紫阳想挑战邓小平的权力；8964被中共屠杀的人都是其权力斗争的牺牲品！
