【Miles Grand Live】6/22/2022 : Chinese people are good in forgetting about hate and disasters, and always find excuses for their cowardice; on the other hand, Chinese people are very harsh on other people and don't tolerate others' mistakes; regarding treating friends, the opinion of the Swamp is very practical: No one can help you all your life, not even God!

【文贵大直播】6/22/2022 ：中国人最爱忘记仇恨忘记灾难，却总给自己的懦弱找借口；但中国人总是要求别人完美，不容忍别人犯错误。在对待朋友的问题上，沼泽地的看法很实际：没有人能帮你一辈子，连上帝也做不到！
