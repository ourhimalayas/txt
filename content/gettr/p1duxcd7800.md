6/12/2022 Miles Guo: According to my judgement, if Xi Jinping doesn't get any smarter, he will still invade Taiwan. His strategy for invasion is most likely a long-term blockade in order to drag down the economies of Taiwan, the U.S. and the world. The Chinese currency will then be able to become dominant. As for using nuclear weapons, the CCP will attempt to do it but will fail.

6/12/2020  文贵直播：据我判断，习近平若没变聪明的话，他还是会打台湾，且很可能采取长期封锁的策略，以期拖垮台湾、美国乃至世界的经济，从而趁机实现人民币的霸主地位。至于使用核武器，中共会使用，但绝不会成功。
