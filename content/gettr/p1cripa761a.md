【NFSC 2nd Anniversary 】06/04/2022 Miles Guo: The farm system of the New Federal State of China is a two-tier parallel system, which is different from the vertical system that can easily breeds corruption and bureaucracy. The design of our farm system comes from the old culture of association in China, which focuses on individuals. In our farms, members treat each other fairly, equally and respectfully. 

【新中国联邦2周年】06/04/2022 郭先生：新中国联邦的农场制度是两个层级的平行系统，而不是容易产生腐败和官僚的垂直系统。农场制度的设计来自中国古老的结社文化，即注重个人，在农场里大家互相尊重，公平公正地相处。
