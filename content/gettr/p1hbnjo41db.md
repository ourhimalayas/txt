7/6/2022 Miles Guo: The Americans are awakened by us. They are very clear that the United States would not be safe as long as the CCP still exists. Now it is the lull before the storm. The US will lower the CCP's guard and then provoke internal power struggles in the CCP to let one side take down the other. However, the US sanctions against the CCP and the investigations on its oversea assets will never stop.

7/6/2022 文贵直播：美国人已被我们唤醒，他们非常清楚，有共产党，美国永远不会安全。现在是风暴前的平静期，美国会先让共产党放松警惕，再通过挑拨离间来加剧其党内斗争，从而利用一方干掉另一方。而美国对中共的制裁和对中共资产的调查一秒钟都不会停止！
