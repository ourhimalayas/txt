5/19/2022 Miles Guo: In the past 24 hours, the Chinese Communist Party has been dumping stocks in the world and exchanging high-quality assets for the Hong Kong dollar, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, and certain currencies in the Middle East. This is the CCP’s preparation for the seizure of its overseas assets. In contrast, because the Chinese people are treated as slaves like animals, they have nothing to sell and are living in the hell, where they cannot afford to live or even die.

5/19/2022文贵直播：就在过去24小时，中共在全球贱卖股票，把高质量资产换成了港币、瑞郎、日元和某些中东币，这是中共在其海外资产被查封前所做的准备；反观如畜奴一般的中国老百姓，他们现在有啥可卖的啊？活也活不起、死更死不起！
