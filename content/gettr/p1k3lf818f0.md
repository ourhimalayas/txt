7/27/2022 Miles Guo: The Federal Reserve will coexist with digital currencies. The Himalaya Exchange, which runs on a private blockchain, is centralized, and has strict KYC requirements and the Himalaya Dollar, the world's only genuine stablecoin, meets the Fed's requirements for fiat and traditional currencies, does not challenge the US dollar, and comply to the anti-money laundering requirements. However, the CCP prohibits its people from owning decentralized digital currencies, and this is just like the Qing dynasty, which was finished because it fell out of step with the world.

7/27/2022 文贵直播：美联储将与数字货币共存；喜联储有私链、中心化、KYC和喜美元这一全球唯一真正的稳定币，符合了美联储对法币和传统货币的要求、不挑战美元且满足反洗钱的条件；中共禁止老百姓拥有去中心化的数字货币，这跟因与世界脱节而灭亡的清朝何其相似？
