7/8/2022 Miles Guo: It is the custom of retired politicians in Japan not to bother their people, while in Communist China, a retired CCP manager would enjoy privileges far better than that of former Japanese prime ministers. This is the contrast between a totalitarian regime vs a democratic country! Citizens of the New Federal State of China should be kind to our fellow human beings; those who are brainwashed by the CCP and wish disasters for the entire world except for themselves, will get their retribution in the end!

7/8/2022 文贵直播：日本的政要卸职后尽量不麻烦国民，而在中共国一个退休的科长享受的待遇都比日本前首相要好，这就是独裁政府和民主国家的区别！新中国联邦人要善待同类；那些被中共洗脑希望全世界都遭殃唯独自己活下去的人一定会得到报应！
