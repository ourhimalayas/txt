7/17/2022 Miles Guo: There are many high-ranking officials who retired from the DOJ with all sorts of political ties to the CCP in the PAG. My personal bankruptcy case has received worldwide attention, and several lawyers from Zhong Lun Law Firm who had worked with me were also shocked by this case. We are verifying every piece of evidence regarding Paul Hastings' conflicts of interest. If Luc Despins is not removed as the trustee, the US judiciary will enter into darkness!

7/17/2022 文贵直播：PAG有很多从美国司法部退下来的跟中共有各种政治来往的高官；文贵破产案得到了全世界的关注，中伦律所的几位曾和文贵合作过的律师都对此感到震惊；我们正在核实关于普衡利益冲突的每一项证据，如果不解除卢克的受托人职位，美国司法将走进黑暗！
