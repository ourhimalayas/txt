【NFSC 2nd Anniversary 】06/04/2022 Steve Bannon: I believe that the CCP will actually fall before the NFSC has to get recognition from the American government. I actually think with this economic collapse and what they've done on the virus, and particularly what they've done over the last six weeks in Shanghai and Guangzhou to the Chinese. When you have 400 million people in hard lockdowns, that's the beginning of the end for the CCP.

【新中国联邦2周年】06/04/2022 史蒂夫·班农：我认为中共会在美国政府承认新中国联邦之前就垮台。我认为实际上伴随着这次经济崩溃，以及中共在病毒意识中的所作所为，尤其是过去六周他们在上海和广州对中共国人民的压迫。当有4亿人处于严格封锁状态，我认为这就是中共灭亡的开始。
