7/13/2022 Miles Guo: In the absence of going through the legal process, the U.S. DOJ replaced my original bankruptcy trustee with someone who has ties with the CCP and absolutely has a conflict of interest, how absurd it is!

7/13/2022 文贵直播：美国司法部未经任何法律程序就把我的破产案受托人换成了一个和中共有密切关系的，绝对有利益冲突的人，这是何等的荒谬！和中共在美国司法部的势力的较量是一个长期的战斗，我们会一直斗争下去，直到把幕后黑手揪出来的那一刻。
