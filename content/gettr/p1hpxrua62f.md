7/9/2022 Miles Guo's GETTR: Paul Hastings, a top 10 U.S. law firm, has generated tremendous revenues from the Greater-China region and represented or advised numerous clients that are inextricably linked to the CCP. However, it went so far as to disregard the law and claimed that they have no conflict of interests. The newly trustee Luc A. Despins told Honorable Julie Manning at the last minute that he just learned PAG was the parent company of PAX. Can you believe it?

7/9/2022 文贵盖特：美国普衡律师事务所，作为全美排名前十的律所，其大中华区业务是其收入的重要来源，普衡和中共有着千丝万缕的联系，竟然罔顾美国法律，瞪眼撒谎说没有利益冲突，而受托人卢克·A·德斯宾斯最后一分钟才对法官说他刚了解到PAG是PAX的母公司，你信吗？
