【NFSC 2nd Anniversary】06/04/2022 Nicole's interview with Mr. Bannon at the 2nd anniversary of the NFSC: Your work on the Polish-Ukrainian border is so important and resonates with people by giving them a glimpse of the new China and the new Chinese people that Miles is talking about; the next step for the NFSC is to try to get recognition from some NGOs and then from some countries.

【新中国联邦2周年】06/04/2022 妮可在新中国联邦2周年庆典采访班农先生：你们在波乌边境的工作是如此重要，让人们看到了文贵所说的新中国和新中国人，让人们产生了共鸣；新中国联邦下一步要做的工作是争取获得一些非政府组织的认可，进而获得某些国家的承认。
