Demographic data leak leads to national trial of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Whistleblower Movement (WM) enters an era of automatic annihilation of the CCP
On July 6, Miles Guo said that China's economy is vulnerable, and the data leak will allow the Chinese people to judge the CCP. All people can look up and review them and aim for Zhongnan Pit. No one wants to kill Qishan Wang, but Xi Jinping. Miles never advocated violence but exposed the intelligence at the initial stage and the WM has entered a critical period. The CCP leaders, whether we hate or love, somehow are fellow fighters. HongKongers, Taiwanese and overseas Chinese will realize the CCP is the root cause of all disasters, and we enter an era of global automatic annihilation of the CCP!
