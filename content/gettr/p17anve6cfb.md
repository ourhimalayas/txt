[Ukraine Rescue] Nicole interviewed an Israeli volunteer who was born in the former Soviet Union on the frontline of the Russian-Ukrainian rescue. As a person born in a former communist dictatorship country, she understands the situation of the Chinese people very well. She knows that living under the communist authoritarian rule is painful and a struggle, and hopes that the Chinese people will be free. She admired the bravery and fearlessness of the people of the New Federation of China, and believes that the people of the New Federation of China truly represent the Chinese people, who love freedom and pursue peace.
