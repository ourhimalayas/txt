7/31/2022 Miles Guo: Switzerland recently announced that sanctions will be adopted if the CCP invades Taiwan. Switzerland's statement simply made the CCP back off and change their tone of voice over Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Because the CCP kleptocrats are so scared of their money hidden in Switzerland being exposed and their families being forced to go back to China, they now have to chicken out. It is a good thing for Taiwan.

7/31/2022 文贵直播：瑞士刚发布的一则声明称如果中共侵台，瑞士会立刻实施制裁。这使得中共突然在佩洛西访台问题上口风变软，因为中共盗国贼害怕他们在瑞士藏的钱财被曝光，家人被遣返回中共国，所以只能认怂，这对台湾是好事。
