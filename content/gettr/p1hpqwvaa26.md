7/9/2022 Miles Guo's GETTR: Luc A. Despins, the new trustee appointed by the DOJ and a partner of Paul Hastings LLP, asked to board Lady May the day before yesterday and bluntly attempted to deceive Her Honorable Julie Manning by claiming at the last minute that he just realized he had worked for PAG. How dare he? I have the rights enshrined by the U.S. law to file an appeal and motion to withdraw and change the trustee. All the truths are bound to be disclosed!

7/9/2022 文贵盖特：美国司法部最新任命的受托人、普衡律所的合伙人卢克先生在前天要求上Lady Day，且在最后一分钟还在试图欺骗曼宁法官，称他才知道他曾为PAG工作过，这胆子也忒大了吧？美国法律赋予了文贵上诉和提出动议撤换受托人的权利，一切都将大白于天下！
