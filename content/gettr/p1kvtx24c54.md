8/1/2022 Miles Guo：We lost completely in today's hearing, but it doesn't mean things are over as we still have the right to appeal. We will use the grounds of procedural justice and facts to challenge all the false accusations against us. One thing to be highlighted in today's hearing is that Luc from Paul Hastings told everybody including those so-called creditors that he would charge hourly instead of taking 1% of the money collected, from which we can see how crazy this guy is!

8/1/2022  文贵直播：今天的听证会我们完全输了，但这不代表事情结束了，我们依然有上诉的权利。我们会用程序正义和事实来驳斥所有对我们的虚假指控。今天听证值得注意的一点是，普衡的卢克向在场全部所谓债权人提出按小时收费，而非抽取查找到资产的1%，真是疯狂至极！
