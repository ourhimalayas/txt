Alan from the British independent media interviewed Nicole, a volunteer of the New Federal State of China who participated in humanitarian relief on the frontline of Russia and Ukraine. Nicole pointed out that the supporters behind Putin are the evil CCP, and the CCP does not represent the Chinese people. The mission of the New Federal State of China is to defend world peace, secure the rule of law, eliminate the greatest threat to human existence—the Chinese Communist Party and free the 1.4 billion Chinese people who are still struggling under the Communist dictatorship.

英国独立媒体人Alan采访了在俄乌前线参与人道主义救援的新中国联邦义工Nicole，Nicole指出普京背后的支持者就是邪恶的中共，中共不代表中国人民。新中国联邦的使命是捍卫世界和平以及安全法治，消除对人类生存最大威胁的中国共产党，并解放仍在中共独裁统治下挣扎的 14 亿中国人民。
