6/12/2022 Miles Guo: Binance only got a provisional test license from Dubai, so all the transactions conducted on its platform are illegal; Singapore did not issue financial license to American companies which applied first, but instead gave it to the CCP's Greenland Holdings Corporation; I have the capability of collecting first-hand intelligence, so I know all the data tampering going on in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange. I even know what Xi Jinping is doing and where he is!

6/12/2022 文贵直播：币安在迪拜使用临时牌照进行的交易都是非法的；新加坡没把牌照发给最早申请金融牌照的美国企业，反倒给了绿地集团；文贵有能力掌握第一手情报，对港交所、上交所篡改数据以及习近平的行踪一清二楚！
