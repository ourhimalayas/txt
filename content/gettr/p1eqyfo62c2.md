6/8/2022 Miles Guo: The US is preparing for six legislations targeting the CCP. Once these legislations get passed, the atrocities committed by the CCP in Tibet and Hong Kong, just like the genocide it committed in Xinjiang, will be condemned and sanctioned by the entire world; the Whistleblowers' Movement played a critical role in designating the CCP's atrocities in Xinjiang as a genocide, as well as the prompt implementation of travel ban by the Trump administration at the beginning of the CCP virus pandemic!

6/8/2022 文贵直播：美国正酝酿6个针对中共的立法；一旦这些法律出台，就像新疆种族大屠杀一样，中共在西藏、香港的恶行都会受到全世界的声讨和制裁；爆料革命的情报对将中共定义为新疆种族大屠杀，及川普政府在中共病毒大流行初期果断实施旅行禁令起到了至关重要的作用！
