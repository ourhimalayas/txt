7/16/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The Western financial bigwigs made it clear that the so-called bank sanctions and the Red Notice issued against me were all based on false accusations by the CCP. The collapse of the Qing Dynasty was because it failed to keep up with the trend of human civilization. Now since the CCP does not even have the strength that the Qing Dynasty had, its attempt to dominate the world is just like an idiot’s daydream.

7/16/2022 文贵盖特：西方金融大佬明确指出这几年对文贵发出的所谓银行制裁，红通之类都是中共的捏造和诬陷！大清朝的没落在于没有跟上人类文明发展的走向，现如今的中共连大清朝曾经辉煌都不具备，统治世界的企图只是痴人说梦。
