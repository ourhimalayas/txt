The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the final battle 
On June 10, Mr. Miles Guo blew the whistle that the 20th National Congress of the CCP is a gift from God. He does not believe it will be held and it is the final battle of the CCP. Before the collapse of successive dynasties, countless bigwigs died one after another. Zemin Jiang, Rongji Zhu, Jianzhu Meng and Ping Song who will line up to die. This situation is not caused by political wars, but God's arrangement. The people are suffered from floods, droughts, vaccine disasters, the destruction of rivers and mountains, and then start all over again, It is highly likely that the Communist Party will not last until 2025.
