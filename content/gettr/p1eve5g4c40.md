6/10/2022 Miles Guo: The so-called intellectuals in Communist China are just the extremely evil tools and accomplices of the CCP! Is there real education in a huge country like Communist China? It was really shocking to me that Wang Enge, former President of Peking University, which is the so-called top-tier university in Communist China, said, "If I do not f**k his/her grandmother, he/she will never call me grandpa". So, the Chinese people are now living as the animal-like slaves. This is so sad, pathetic, and tragic!

6/10/2022 文贵直播：中共国的所谓知识分子就是中共的极端邪恶的工具和帮凶！诺大的中共国哪里还有教育？所谓最高学府北大前校长王恩哥当年在私人飞机上的一句"我不干你奶奶，你就不喊我爷爷"的话震惊了文贵；中国人进入了畜奴时代，悲哀啊！
