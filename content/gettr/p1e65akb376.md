6/12/2022 Miles Guo: The intellectual and cultural circles support Li Keqiang because of his legal background, while the various factions in the CCP also count on him to balance their interests; Alvin Jiang meaningfully told a foreign bigwig that China would reintroduce an open-door policy after the 20th National Congress and advised him to seize the chance to invest in China; Alvin Jiang was border-controlled for 11 months and his grudge against Xi is extraordinary!

6/12/2022 文贵直播：知识界和文化界支持李克强是源于他的法律背景，同时党内各派也指望他能平衡大家的利益；江志成意味深长地对某国外大佬说20大后中国会重新开放，并建议他抓住该时机在中国投资；江志成被边控11个月，他对习的仇恨非同寻常！
