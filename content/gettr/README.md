4月16号：尊敬的战友们好！共产党的无知，愚蠢，和邪恶，只能用一个办法来解决，那就是彻底的消灭他们。【七哥好，乌克兰战争爆发以来有人粗略统计了中文媒体相关数据：泽连斯基逃跑18次，基辅失守4次，亚速营被歼灭9次。马里乌波尔被全面占领11次。乌海军陆战队投降人数都超过整编编制人数了。普京一共怒了93次，撂狠话58次，挑明了24次，美国怂了136次，北约尿了98次，欧盟跪了105次。】<br/>😄😄😄快乐灭共！

【Ukraine Rescue】04/15/2022 A self-media person from Brazil is amazed by the NFSC and ROLF’s strong financial ability and high-quality volunteers, the NFSC is able to set up the largest and most well-equipped tent in the entire camp within two days. Volunteer Nicole tells him that if large Western companies want to gain access to the huge market of 1.4 billion Chinese, they must cut ties with the CCP and stand with the NFSC to destroy the CCP. The CCP does not represent the Chinese people. He says he will help spread the news about the NFSC in Brazil.<br/><br/>【乌克兰救援】04/15/2022 一个巴西的自媒体人惊叹于新中国联邦法治基金的强大财力和义工们一流的素质──能够在两天之内建起了整个营地最大、设施最完善的帐篷！义工妮可告诉他西方大公司若想得到14亿中国人的巨大市场，必须切断与中共的关系，跟灭共的新中国联邦站在一起。中共不代表中国人。他表示会在巴西帮助传播新中国联邦。<br/>

【Ukraine Rescue】04/14/2022 A Turkish reporter was attracted by the slogan in our Medyka tent, “We are the new Chinese who are taking down the Evil Chinese Communist Party.“ Although the Turkish reporter thinks that politics should be avoided at this time, when he hears that the big tent of the big tent of the New Federal State of China has taken in over 10,000 Ukrainian refugees, his face shows a look of disbelief and he has to say with admiration how well it was done!<br/><br/>【乌克兰救援】04/14/2022 一位土耳其记者被我们帐篷里的标语“我们是消灭中共的新中国人“所吸引。尽管这位土耳其记者认为此时应该回避政治，但当他听说新中国联邦大帐篷已经接收超过万名乌克兰难民，他的脸上还是露出了不可思议的表情，不得不佩服地说做得太好了！
