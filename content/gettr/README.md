1/19/2022 Miles Guo: The old CCP kleptocrats have been giving prescriptions to the world at the Davos Forum, resulting in the suffering of the Chinese, and eventually it’s their turn to suffer. What does Xi mean by saying "spillover effect"? The Davos Forum is a slave master's club where the dark forces and the CCP collude to enslave the whole world.<br/><br/>1/19/2022 文贵直播：中共老杂毛在达沃斯给世界开药方，让中国人遭殃，最终轮到他们自己身上；习说的“溢出效应”有何意？达沃斯论坛是黑暗势力和中共勾结以奴役全世界的奴隶主俱乐部<br/>

1/19/2022 Miles Guo: Less than 1,000 people attend the World Economic Forum at Davos. They can influence the politics and military of various countries and control the wealth that shapes the fate of hundreds of millions of people, and they collude with governments and have blood on their hands. As long as the Party of Davos still exists, humanity will never be safe<br/><br/>1/19/2022 文贵直播：参加达沃斯论坛的不足1000人，他们影响着各国的政治和军事，控制着左右数以亿计人命运的财富，他们跟政府勾结、手上沾满鲜血；只要达沃斯党在，人类就不会安全<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: Procedure justice is the key in the Western judicial system. However, Pacific Alliance and the judge in the PAX case disregarded the law and common sense. They didn’t allow me to speak up in court. Nor did I have the permission to question the opposing party. Instead, they charged me with contempt of court. Is that still called the rule of law?<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：西方世界的法律讲究的是程序正义，但太平联盟及PAX案的法官罔顾法律和常识，既不允许文贵张嘴说话、也不允许质疑对方，直接判文贵藐视法庭，这还叫法治吗？<br/>

1/18/2021 Miles Guo: The CCP has infiltrated the whole world’s judicial system by posing threats and implementing the BGY plan, but the US and the rest of the world will wake up for sure. It’s said that the forced confession made by Sun Lijun in the Zero Tolerance documentary showed Xi Jinping giving in to the four major forces of Jiang Zemin, Meng Jianzhu, and Wang Qishan. What will happen after Xi’s speech at Davos and the Winter Olympics?<br/><br/>1/18/2021 文贵盖特：中共使用威胁和蓝金黄对全球司法界实行渗透，美国和全世界一定会醒来！听说孙力军的《零容忍》认罪是习向江曾孟王四大势力妥协的结果，冬奥会习太阳的达沃斯讲话后会发生什么事情呢？<br/>

1/18/2021 Miles Guo’s GETTR: How powerful Weijian Shan and Edward Moss really are? In the past five years, why is it that the CCP’s unrestricted lawfare, the smear campaigns, and the attacks on me and the Whistleblowers’ Movement all happened at roughly the same time? Are these just coincidences?<br/><br/>1/18/2021 文贵盖特：单伟建和Edward Moss到底有多大的能耐？过去5年里，为什么中共对文贵和爆料革命的法律超限战以及污蔑与攻击几乎都在同时发生？难道这仅仅是巧合吗？<br/>

In a country ravaged by the CCP without the rule of law, what a blessing it is to destroy the CCP!<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：文贵以家人的命、鲜血、自由和财富换来个人的觉醒，让文贵今天带着全人类开始灭共！在这个被共产党蹂躏和没有法律的国度里，灭共是件多么幸福的事！<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP’s frivolous lawsuits keep pushing us step by step. I predict that the ruling will go against us when the Lady May case goes on trial on February 2nd. The CCP has controlled the entire judicial system in BVI, and Appleby, the law firm representing the opposing party, also has conflicts of interest. Our second battlefield is right in BVI!<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：中共缠诉步步紧逼，文贵预测2月2日Lady May的案子开庭将被判大输；BVI的司法体系被共产党搞定，对方的Appleby律所竟也有利益冲突，我们的第二战场就在BVI！<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: What will happen in the hearing to be held on February 2nd? Why is the Pacific Alliance case comparable to the case of Li You tried by Zhang Mingpeng in Xigang District, Dalian? Why did the Pacific Alliance issue subpoenas for the very information that the CCP wants the most? Is there any collusion between Bruno Wu, Wang Qishan, and the law firms that have offices in Communist China? What is the connection between those who were involved in the largest corruption case in the DOJ history and the Pacific Alliance case?<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：2月2日的听证会将发生什么？为何说太平联盟案跟大连西岗区张明鹏判的李友案有的一比？太平联盟发传票要求提供的信息为何恰恰是中共最想要的？吴征、王岐山和在中共国设办公室的律所之间有何勾当？美国司法部史上最大腐败案的涉案人员和太平联盟案有何关联？<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: Can the Pacific Alliance case represent procedural justice? This lawsuit should not have existed in the first place, and Judge Barry Ostrager had long been turning a blind eye to Bradley Bondi and Edward Moss's clear breach of the lawyers’ professional ethics. The two lawyers not only committed forgery, but their mere conflict of interest nearly devastated us. So, who will make up for the damage they have inflicted on us in the past five years?<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：处处不正常的太平联盟案能代表程序正义吗？这场官司本不应该存在，可Ostrager法官却长期无视Bondi和Edward Moss明显违反律师道德的行为，他们俩不仅造假，区区一次利益冲突就差点要了咱的命，那谁来弥补他们在这5年给我们造成的伤害呢？<br/><br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: The judge in the Pacific Alliance case did not allow us to choose jury trial and gave a huge fine to Lady May, which is not even owned by myself, and the adverse party provided more than 70,000 pages of evidence and over 300,000 pages of documents to overwhelm us, turning the lawsuit about the $30-million loan into the one costing hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees. The Pacific Alliance admitted that the principal and interest of the loan were paid off, but why did the Beijing police want to assist them to deal with this case?<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：太平联盟案的法官不许我们选陪审团审判、给并非文贵所有的Lady May开巨额罚单，对方提供7万多页的证据和30余万页的文件，3000万的官司却要花费上亿律师费；太平联盟承认借款的本息均已还清，但北京警察为何要协助他们处理本案呢？<br/>

1/17/2022 Miles Guo: This Pacific Alliance case is so ridiculous! Pacific Alliance sued me, the loan guarantor, out of nothing despite there being legal documents proving that the borrower had repaid the loan. A New York court accepted this case regardless of the fact that the plaintiff is not in New York and neither did the whole thing happen in New York. The defendant was not allowed to challenge the verdict, and they seek to seize the property that does not belong to the defendant<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播: 太平联盟一案荒谬至极！太平联盟在有法律文件证明借方已还清贷款的情况下却无中生有起诉贷款担保人，而纽约法院受理了一个当事人和事件都不在纽约的案件，而且既不允许被告对判决提出任何质疑，又要查封不属于被告的财产！<br/>

1/17/2021 Miles Guo: The largest corruption case in the DOJ history reflects the CCP spies’ infiltration in the Western judicial system.

Both of them were disqualified as the plaintiff’s counsel due to their serious violations of professional ethics.<br/><br/>1/17/2022 文贵直播：文贵在跟中共操纵的世界大案较量！曾代理文贵和战友的Bondi律师让太平联盟的律师Edward Moss跳槽到Cahill律所并一同针对文贵，他俩因判严重违反职业道德而被踢出局<br/>
