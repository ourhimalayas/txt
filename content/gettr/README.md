1/5/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP is thinking of expanding its territories; the nightmare-like bitter days for the Chinese people will start between May and December this year, more cities will be under lockdown, and more people will be quarantined and disappear; the CCP is using digital RMB to stabilize its estate market and seeks to have a say in terms of digital currency<br/><br/>1/5/2022 文贵直播：中共妄图开疆拓土；中国人噩梦般的苦日子将从今年5月到12月间开始，更多城市会被封，更多人会被隔离和消失；中共用数字货币稳定楼市并想主导数字货币话语权<br/>

Xi’an: a cold-like disease can lead to starvation and the vaccine disaster is unfolding. Only by taking down the CCP can save all the innocent people around the world<br/><br/>西安：一个感冒就要挨饿的地方，疫苗灾难正在发生。只有推翻共产党，才能救这些打了疫苗的全球无辜的人

946,000 people have suffered serious #SideEffects or even died after getting injected with the #COVID #Vaccine. What's worse, not only does the vaccine appear to be useless against the virus, but people who do get injected seem to be much, much worse than those who remain unvaccinated. We are witnessing the serious consequences of this untested, unproven, rushed vaccine firsthand, and it's far worse than anyone feared. This is just the beginning. <br/><br/>94万6千人在注射新冠疫苗后遭受严重副作用，甚至死亡。更糟糕的是，疫苗不仅看起来对病毒无效，而且注射疫苗的人比不注射的人境况更糟。我们正在见证这种未经测试、未经证实、匆忙上市的疫苗的严重后果，它比任何人担心的都更加糟糕。这仅仅是刚刚开始。

1/5/2022 Miles Guo: The President of Lithuania admitted that he was wrong about the Taiwan issue due to Xi blackmailing him with the secrets of his private life; I have been talking about Kazakhstan and Nazarbayev since 2017. That the CCP never exports revolutions is a lie, and the riot is the price paid for Kazakhstan’s collusion with the CCP<br/><br/>1/5/2022 文贵直播：立陶宛总统就台湾问题认错因其把柄被习近平抓住；文贵从2017年就开始谈哈萨克斯坦和纳扎尔巴耶夫，“中共不输出革命”是谎言，哈萨克斯坦的动乱是跟中共为伍的代价

1/05/2021 Miles Guo: Was the riot happening in Kazakhstan provoked by the CIA or part of the CCP’s insidious plan? The President of Kazakhstan will face serious consequences if he refuses to hand over the CCP kleptocrats’ gold to Xi. It’s said that the President has backed down, but as always, the CCP will blame the US for the riot<br/><br/>1/05/2021 文贵直播：哈萨克斯坦暴乱到底是美国CIA挑唆，还是中共使坏？哈总统拒绝返还中共盗国贼的黄金，后果很严重；据说哈总统已服软，但中共这一次照样会甩锅给美国<br/>

1/5/2022 Miles Guo: Nursultan Nazarbayev, Wang Qishan’s best buddy, helped Wang and Jiang Zemin hide 100 tons of gold in Kazakhstan; Xi Jinping had sent Wang Yi to ask Nazarbayev for the gold, and a social unrest occurred right after Wang Yi left Kazakhstan; Nazarbayev threatened Xi that he would establish a diplomatic relationship with Taiwan if Xi demanded gold from him again<br/><br/>1/5/2022 文贵直播：扎尔巴耶夫是王岐山最好的哥们儿，帮王和江藏了100吨黄金在哈萨克斯坦；习近平派王毅找扎尔巴耶夫要黄金，王毅刚走哈萨克斯坦就发生了动乱；纳扎尔巴耶夫竟威胁习，称若习再来要黄金就和台湾建交<br/>

💓💓MORE THAN HALF A MILLION NOW - This was published on January 4, 2021 - - - Huge: Half million follow Joe Rogan to GETTR💓💓<br/><br/>"GETTR, an upstart Twitter challenger aimed at free speech advocates and conservatives who have been squelched on liberal-leaning social media sites, is nearing four million users exactly six months after its Independence Day launch.<br/><br/> The site reported that Rogan’s announcement prompted more than 171,000 people to open GETTR accounts Sunday. On Monday, another 341,000 joined, and as of today, new sign-ups have totaled 545,000 since Rogan said, “Just in case s*** over at Twitter gets even dumber, I’m here now as well.

I’m calling on every Republican to LEAVE Twitter! <br/><br/>The truth is under attack and so are our Republican Conservative values.<br/><br/>Twitter has censored millions of Conservative Americans for too long now without any restraint.<br/><br/>Real Congressional action is not possible anytime soon.<br/><br/>Twitter needs to learn a lesson.<br/><br/>Do NOT violate Free Speech rights guaranteed to Americans and do NOT act as an aggressor toward elected officials.<br/><br/>Twitter is a danger to us all by deeming itself the judge of speech on its platform.<br/><br/>It’s time to end their abuse of power they were never given.<br/><br/>Leave Twitter NOW!!!<br/>
