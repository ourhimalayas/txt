2/6/2022 Miles Guo: The current economic situation in the US indicates that the CCP virus and the COVID vaccine disasters have destroyed the supply chains. I have said in early 2020 that the secondary disasters and crises caused by the CCP virus and COVID vaccines will start this May. This is the conclusion I draw based upon the intelligence I have about the CCP.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播：美国目前的经济说明中共病毒和疫苗灾难摧毁了供应链；文贵在2020年初就说病毒和疫苗造成的次生灾难和危机将于今年5月开始，这是文贵基于所掌握的中共情报而作出的判断<br/>

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: Why did the CCP let Weijian Shan go abroad during the Cultural Revolution? How did the CCP infiltrate the US by using the Ping-pong diplomacy?<br/>China and the US depend on each other for security and complement each other in terms of culture, and there is no historical conflict between the two. The Sino-US economic cooperation will be the best in the world!<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播: 中共为什么在文革期间让单伟建出国？中共是如何用乒乓外交渗透美国的？中美之间生死与共、文化互补、无历史冲突，中美经济合作必将是天下第一！<br/>

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: Our fellow fighters are everywhere at the Winter Olympics such that I can always know what is going on. Fellow fighters have helped foreign leaders and athletes understand the true nature of the CCP, and this is the fundamental reason why Putin left Communist China earlier than expected.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播: 冬奥会无处不在的战友让现场的一切情况尽在文贵的掌握之中；新中国联邦的战友们在冬奥会让外国元首和运动员认清中共本质，这就是普京提前离开中共国的根本原因<br/>

Ms. Christine Anderson said, "Whenever a political entity resorts to extortion and manipulation to push an agenda so hard, you can almost always be sure your benefit is definitely not what they had at heart. I will not be vaccinated with anything that has not been properly vetted and tested, and has shown no sound scientific evidence that the benefits outweigh the risks and that there are no long-term side effects. I will not get vaccinated because my government tells me to and promises in return I will be granted freedom. No one grants me freedom, for I am a free person."<br/><br/>欧盟议会议员 Christine Anderson 女士：每当一个政治团体如此强硬地推行他们的计划，并且为了达到目的而使用威逼利诱的手段时，你几乎可以肯定，他们的心里绝对没有你的利益。我不会注射任何没有经过适当审查和测试、没有可靠科学证据能够表明其利大于弊且不会有长期副作用的疫苗。我也绝对不会为了政府许诺给我的自由而去打疫苗。没有人可以给我自由，因为我本就是一个自由人。

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: The reason why the CCP kowtows to Russia is that the Caucasians in the West don’t want to engage with them. So, the CCP can only use the excuse that Russia is the origin of communism to fool the Chinese people. With the anger building up in the hearts of the Chinese, they can turn against the CCP once they have a chance.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播: 中共认俄爹是因为西方白人不愿和中共交往，中共只好以俄国是共产主义发源地为由忽悠中国人；中国老百姓心中积压的怒火使得他们一有机会就会向中共动手<br/>

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP collects urine and feces from the leaders and athletes of various countries participating in the Winter Olympics to serve its evil purpose - to extract and use their genes to produce a “better” race. The CCP is racist at its core and worships superior physiques and eugenics.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播: 中共收集参加冬奥会各国领导人和运动员的尿和大便是服务于其邪恶的目的 - 提取并用他们的基因以生出“更优秀”的种族；中共骨子里是种族主义者并且崇拜优秀人体和基因<br/>

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: The Winter Olympics is dedicated to Xi Jinping only! Everyone in the CCP hates Xi for holding the Winter Olympics and the athletes colluding with the CCP. The CCP lacks both the financial resources and capabilities to successfully host the Winter Olympics. The West started to investigate the corruption in the International Olympics Committee caused by the CCP.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播: 冬奥会是习太阳一个人的！党内都恨习办冬奥会以及和中共同流合污的运动员；中共在财力和能力上都无法保证冬奥会成功召开；西方已开始调查国际奥委会跟中共的腐败<br/>

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP got a slap in the face by claiming that more than 100 countries would participate in the opening of the Winter Olympics, while in fact less than five leaders of powerful countries made it. The opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics has become the closing ceremony of the end of the CCP. Putin's girlfriend brought her own rations when visiting Communist China and has never had the food offered by the CCP because it contains chemicals.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播：中共被打脸，号称百余国参加的冬奥会开幕却只有不到5个有实力国家的元首出席；冬奥会开幕式已成为中共结束的闭幕式；普京女友访华自带口粮，从不碰中共化学食品<br/>

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: The all-weather strategic partnership is essentially forming alliances. Money is the key for the CCP to maintain its relationship with Russia. Although Russia’s annual GDP is only $1 trillion, it signed gas agreements with the CCP with a total deal value of over $1 trillion. Why did Putin go back to Russia without signing the deal with the CCP to designate the RMB as Russia’s legal tender?<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播：中共全天候战略伙伴的本质是结盟；维持中俄关系全靠钱，只有1万亿美元GDP的俄罗斯从中共就签了总价值1万多亿的合同；普京为何不跟中共签把人民币作为法币的协议就回去了呢？<br/>

2/6/2022 Miles Guo: It was as if the athletes attending the Winter Olympics were thrown into jail by the CCP, and their food was spat on before being served. After Putin left, who will attend the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics? The fellow fighters will make those who collude with the CCP dare not come to Communist China for the rest of their lives. I will make sure that the closing ceremony of the CCP’s Winter Olympics can never end.<br/><br/>2/6/2022 文贵直播：冬奥会运动员就像被中共关在监狱，食物竟被吐唾沫；普京走了后谁会来参加闭幕式？战友会让跟中共勾兑的人一辈子不敢来中共国；文贵要让中共的闭幕会永远无法闭幕<br/>

2/5/2022 Miles Guo: There are three points made by almost everyone attending the CCP’s Winter Olympics: 1) the CCP is over, 2) everything is just fake, and 3) it is absolutely a nightmare. Many people are now trying to figure out how to transfer their money out of Communist China ASAP.<br/><br/>2/5/2022 文贵盖特：所有参加中共冬眠会的人就三句话：1）中共完了，2）一切都是假的，3）这简直就是一场噩梦；很多人现在只想着如何尽快把他们的钱从中共国转出来。

2/5/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Over 300 people at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics were sent to quarantine. Should Xi Jinping be quarantined as well? After his team got knocked out by the virus in Beijing, Putin made a harsh remark that the CCP must give Russia half of its territories as a pledge so that RMB can become the second legal tender in Russia. Will that be possible?<br/><br/>2/5/2022 文贵盖特：冬眠会开幕式现场300多人被拉走隔离，习神难道不需要隔离？普京在北京几乎被团灭后放狠话，中共得拿出半壁江山押给俄罗斯才能让人民币成为其第二法币，这个能实现吗？<br/>

This is the BIG ONE I previewed on @WarRoom a little earlier regarding the Covid Squid Games.<br/><br/>Sincere thanks to @Miles Guo for breaking this in Chinese. <br/><br/>Not a single Western MSM outlet has reported this:<br/><br/>*three people have died at Beijing’s Waldorf Astoria hotel — reports noted violent spasms and convulsions before death<br/><br/>*Vladimir Putin is staying at the Waldorf Astoria<br/><br/>*16 people in Putin's personal entourage have been infected — including four or five bodyguards <br/><br/>Our crooked globalist overlords are all together in one place inside Beijing’s sealed triple-locked closed-loop bubble. Time to weld all the exits closed from the outside — Xian City style — and sit it out… <br/><br/>https://gnews.org/1956094

<br/> 2月5号悲哀呀悲哀［在中共国，买一个或多个女人均判3年以下有期徒刑，但是买一个鹦鹉都要判5年以下，买2个鹦鹉要判5年以上，买20只癞蛤蟆判3年，所以中国人的命在共产党眼里连鸟都不如，与癞蛤蟆等价。In China, buying one or more women is punishable by up to three years in prison, but buying one parrot is punishable by up to five years, buying two parrots is punishable by more than five years, and buying 20 toads is punishable by three years, so the lives of Chinese people are worse than birds in the eyes of the Communists and are equal to those of toads.］
