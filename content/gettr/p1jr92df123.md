7/25/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The last 48 hours in the past year seem to have the most COVID infection cases among our fellow fighters and their families. Our scientist suggests that our fellow fighters avoid going out or being in contact with others in the coming two or three weeks, and must take precautions and wear masks. Fellow fighters should also be well-prepared for your daily needs. Our lives won’t be meaningful unless we can live well and stay healthy until the demise of the CCP.

7/25/2022 文贵盖特：过去的48小时是这一年来战友及其家人染上中共病毒最多的时候，我们的科学家告诫战友们在未来的两到三周内务必少出门、少接触人，要做好防护并戴好口罩；战友们在生活上要做好准备，咱们要健康地活到灭共的时候才有意义！
