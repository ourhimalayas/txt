7/27/2022 Miles Guo: In 2021, I said that Trump had to avoid being convicted of a crime if he wanted to win the presidential election in 2024, but I already had a feeling at that time that he would most likely be convicted of a crime. Both Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan and Biden's phone call with Xi serve the purpose of winning the 2022 midterm elections for the Democrats. Through Pelosi's plan of visiting Taiwan, the Biden administration can force the CCP to make some deals with the U.S. that will favor their political interests.

7/27/2022 文贵直播：我2021年就说过，川普若想赢得2024总统大选，必须避免被刑事定罪，且我当时就认为川普很可能被刑事定罪；佩洛西访台、拜登与习近平通话都是为了民主党赢得中期选举。通过佩洛西访台，拜登政府可以给中共施压以达成利于其政治利益的某些交易。
