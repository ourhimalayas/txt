5/8/2022 Miles Guo: Most of the CCP cadres still maintain the bottom line of humanity - filial piety. This is why 99% of the CCP members are good people. I think it is those in the CCP that will end up destroying the CCP. Because they know that their families will have no future if they don't take down the CCP. Han Zheng is the one who wants to tear apart the CCP the most, and both Jia Qinglin and Li Keqiang want to destroy the CCP from the bottom of their hearts.

5/8/2022 文贵直播：中共大部分官员都保持了人性的底线 - 孝敬，这就是为什么99%的中共党员是好人；文贵相信最终灭共的一定是共产党自己人，因为他们知道，如果不灭共，他们的家人将没有未来！韩正最想让中共解体，而贾庆林和李克强打心里想把共产党给消灭了
