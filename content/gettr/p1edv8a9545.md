6/5/2022 Miles Guo with the 2nd gen. of the fellow fighters of the Whistleblowers’ Movement: I hope young people stick to principles when dealing with matters. Don’t echo the views of others. The CCP intends to brainwash young people so that they have no principles and thus do not know how to make decisions. Never will a few individuals or families be allowed to control the New Federal State of China. The future belongs to the second generation of the fellow fighters of the Whistleblowers’ Movement.

6/5/2022 文贵与爆二代：文贵希望年轻人做事有原则，不要人云亦云；中共就是要通过洗脑让年轻人没有原则，从而不懂得做决策；绝不允许某几个人或家族控制新中国联邦，未来属于爆二代
