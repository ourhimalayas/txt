5/6/2022 Miles Guo: The US has groomed the CCP to be its archenemy over the past 30 years. The CCP's economic development does not take into account the well-being of future generations, while it seeks to challenge the US. The real rivalry is between the US and the CCP, and it could accompany us for the rest of our lives. The number of deaths due to wars and the COVID vaccine disaster this year will likely far exceed that of WWII, and the unemployment rates in many countries will be as high as 35% to 50%

5/6/2022 文贵直播：美国在过去30年培养中共成为其劲敌；中共的经济发展毫不顾及子孙后代的福祉并妄图挑战美国；真正的较量是美国和中共，这可能会伴随着我们的一生；今年因战争和疫苗灾难而死亡的人数可能将远超二战，多国的失业率将高达35%到50%
