Nicole is interviewing a Dutch volunteer about the Ukraine rescue operation of the Rule of Law Foundation and the New Federal State of China and our mission to take down the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He said he didn't expect to see Chinese people here, as he was under the impression that only Europeans and Americans were here to do humanitarian aid. However, he was glad to see the presence of new Chinese people, showing that not all of them were in support of the Communists and this war.  
妮可采访荷兰义工谈法治基金新中国联邦的乌克兰救援、灭共的使命。他说，没想到在这里看到中国人，因为他的印象里是只有欧美人才会在这里做人道救援，他很高兴看到新中国人的出现，说明不是所有的中国人都是支持共产党和这场战争的。
