6/27/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: America has a huge economic bubble, but the economic recession and freefall haven’t started yet. The investors who hold a large number of stocks are unable to sell them off because they have lots of financial arrangements and are highly leveraged. They have been ripping people off for their whole life, and God will let them destroy themselves eventually. Some people in Communist China want to take advantage of the Russians by buying discounted assets from them. However, money doesn’t grow on trees, and neither is there a free lunch.

6/27/2022 文贵盖特：美国经济有巨大泡沫，但经济衰退和断崖尚未开始。持有大量股票的投资者玩了太多金融安排和杠杆，没法抛售股票，这些人割了一辈子韭菜，最终上天会让其自取灭亡；中共国有人想占便宜买俄罗斯人打折的资产，但天下没有掉下来的馅饼，更没有免费的午餐
