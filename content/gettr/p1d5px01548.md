【NFSC 2nd Anniversary 】The whole world's disasters are caused by the CCP rather than the Chinese. However, people in Wall Street are aiding and abetting the CCP and selling out America. Mr. Bannon and I have been working hard to wake up the world, and that "take down the CCP" has become the No. 1 slogan in the world! We must show the world the good side of the Chinese people. Thanks to America for providing us with security and opportunities. We will never give up and we will win for sure!
