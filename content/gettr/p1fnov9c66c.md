 On June 24, Mr. Miles Guo blew the whistle that China Energy Fund, Shenhua Investment, China Huaneng and China Shenlong Groups all traded in RMB, and trillions of dollars were hidden overseas, and countless cash and gold were hidden in Europe, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Singapore and Seychelles etc. New heights of the WM is to find the wealth, not to care about Wang Qishan's death. The New Federal State of China aims to take back these wealth and return it to the deplorable and wants to protect the wealth and safety of overseas Chinese. Beijing International Trust is just a beginning, aiming to dig out the countless the kleptocrats of CCP’s!
