5/13/2022 Miles Guo: Following the "triple kill" of stocks, bonds, and cryptos, where did the money go? The global GDP growth rate is only half of that of last year, but the amount of money issued has doubled. So, your money has depreciated by 50%! All the bubbles created by QE from 2008 till now will burst!

5/13/2022 文贵直播：股市、债和数字货币“三杀”后，钱去哪儿了？今年全球GDP增长只有过去的一半，但货币却增发了一倍！你口袋里的钱超过一半已蒸发！2008年到现在因QE产生的一切都将还回去！
