7/14/2022 Miles Guo: How dangerous is PAG? PAG was capable of having Duowei News work with it to falsify evidence to deceive an American judge, and it was able to shut down Duowei News and let Edward Moss, former attorney of O’Melveny, violate the ethics and professional rules of lawyers by moving the PAG case to Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP that represented GTV, Behind the scenes, the CCP paid hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees. The CCP can pay tens of billions of dollars as long as these law firms can take me out via unrestricted warfare.

7/14/2022 文贵直播：PAG有多危险？PAG能让多维和它一起伪造证据欺骗美国法官，然后关掉多维、让美迈斯的律师Edward Moss违背职业道德把PAG的案子移到曾代理GTV的Cahill律所，中共在背后付了上亿美元的律师费！只要这些律所能用超限战干掉文贵，中共可以给几百亿美元
