5/8/2022 Miles Guo: Almost all the CCP senior cadres are extremely filial to their parents, with Xi Jinping being the No. 1 filial son in the world. However, the CCP does not allow the rest of the Chinese people to have filial respect for their parents. Those inside the CCP actually worship Chiang Kai-shek. Hu Jintao's wife said that Chiang Kai-shek was not only filial to his parents, but his calligraphy work was excellent. In contrast, she said Mao Zedong was not filial to his parents and his calligraphy was like a devil's work.

5/8/2022 文贵直播：几乎所有的中共高官都极其孝敬父母，习近平可谓是天下第一大孝子，而中共却不让其他人孝敬父母；中共内部实际上是崇拜蒋介石的，胡锦涛夫人说蒋介石孝敬父母而且写一手好字，而毛泽东不仅不孝敬父母而且写的是妖体字！
