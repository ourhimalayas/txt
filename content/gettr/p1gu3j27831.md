7/2/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The Westerners are aware that the CCP was bluffing given the sharp contrast between those who accompanied the Queen to visit Hong Kong and the people sent by the CCP to attend the 25th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong. Xi gave a speech at an empty hall in the Kowloon Railway Station to threaten Hong Kong. The EU is going to push digital currencies by coexisting with merchants. Stablecoins and the digital currencies requiring KYC will be accepted by the governments. The Himalaya Exchange’s KYC reflects its advanced productivity. Bitcoins and Ethereum will drop to zero!

7/2/2022 文贵盖特：当年陪英女王去香港的人和中共派来庆祝"回归25周年"的人对比之鲜明，让西方明白，中共在装腔作势；习近平在九龙火车站空荡的大厅威胁香港；欧洲要和商家共推数字货币；有稳定币和KYC的数字货币会被政府接受；喜联储的KYC体现了其最先进的生产力；比特币和以太币会归零！
