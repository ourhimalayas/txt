Nicole is having a conversation with a college student from Jerusalem. The student says that evil will never win over good and communism will fail someday, just like what happened to her grandparents in the Soviet Union. Nicole says that many Chinese people inside China have been brainwashed by the CCP’s propaganda machine and their actions are aligned with the CCP. The student believes that once people feel the freedom, they can never go back; every person in this world deserves freedom and to live his or her best life.

妮可与一名来自耶路撒冷的大学生交谈。大学生说邪恶永远不会战胜正义，共产主义最终会垮台，就像发生在她祖父母身上的前苏联一样。妮可说很多中共国内的中国人被中共的宣传机器洗脑后，行为跟中共步调一致。大学生相信一旦人们尝到了自由，就再也回不去了；世界上的每个人都应得自由，并且过他们最好的生活。
