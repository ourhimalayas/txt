7/3/2022 Miles Guo: Two incidents triggered my decision to quit smoking together with our fellow fighters: (1) my conversation with a tobacco business tycoon at Phoenix; (2) the advice from our master in Wudang Mountains; for the sake of the Whistleblowers' Movement, I quitted drinking and have been keeping my lust at bay. I surely will be able to quit smoking!
