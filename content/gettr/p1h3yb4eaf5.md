7/4/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The United States of America is the greatest country in the world, and her establishment has brought unprecedented peace and development to the world, transforming the world from a slave society to a democratic society with human rights. In contrast, the Chinese Communist Party has turned China into a primitive society, and the mutual harm of the people in the Communist China is far worse than that of North Korea!

7/4/2022 文贵盖特：美国是世界上最伟大的国家，她的建立为世界带来了前所未有的和平与发展，让世界从奴隶社会转变为民主、人权社会；而中国却被中共变成了原始社会，中共国人们之间的互害比北朝鲜还夸张！
