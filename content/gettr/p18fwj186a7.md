Dean, a volunteer at the Medyka camp from the Polish Red Cross, was pleased to know that the New Federal State of China was destroying the CCP. He said that someone must stand up to end the tyranny of the CCP. He was very happy to see that the New Federal State of China was doing this. There must be someone. Mr. Miles Guo started the movement, and then more people joined in , it grows and grows.
波兰红十字会的义工Dean很高兴在梅迪卡营地知道了新中国联邦正在灭共，他说，必须有人站出来终止中共暴政， 很高兴看到新中国联邦正在做这件事， 总得有一个人（郭先生）开始这场运动，然后更多的人加入进来，这个运动就会越来越大。
