6/5/2022 Miles Guo with the 2nd gen. of the fellow fighters of the Whistleblowers’ Movement: 
The best way to take down the Chinese Communist Party is to make yourself strong. Whatever young people would do, they must first decide how to do it, when to do it, and who to do it. After that, put it into action!

6/5/2022 文贵与爆二代：灭共的最好办法就是要让自己强大起来；年轻人无论做什么事，都要先想好怎么做，什么时候做，谁来做，然后付之于行动！
