Nicole is interviewing a former Israeli soldier, Alex, the head of the Israeli-Ukrainian war front-line rescue delegation, who is also a current reservist. He talked about the importance of Holocaust Remembrance Day to Israelis, and of course his own family. 

The peace-loving Chinese people of the New Federal State of China and Israeli Jews stand together in order to maintain lofty humanitarianism, jointly defend world peace, and let the people of the world recognize that Russia’s Putin and the illegal regime of the Chinese Communist Party are the criminal culprits who launched this war of aggression.

妮可采访的是一位来自前以色列军人亚里克斯，以色列乌克兰战争前线救援代表团团长，他也是现预备役军人。他谈到了大屠杀纪念日对以色列人的重要性，当然也包括他自己的家庭。热爱和平的新中国联邦人和以色列犹太人站在一起为了维护崇高的人道主义，共同捍卫世界和平并让世界人民认清俄罗斯普京和中共非法政权才是发动这场侵略战争的罪恶元凶。
