7/27/2022 Miles Guo: The goal of the Xi-Biden call is to make deals: Chinese people will continue working as slaves to keep the cheap supply chain going, and the CCP will continue purchasing the US National debt. As a trade off, Nancy Pelosi shall cancel her trip to Taiwan, and the US shall not disclose the overseas assets of the CCP kleptocrats; the traitors in Taiwan probably will cut a deal with the CCP at the cost of Taiwan people's interests!

7/27/2022 文贵直播：习近平与拜登通话的目的是做交易：中国人继续做奴隶提供廉价供应链、中共继续买美国国债，以换取佩罗西放弃台湾之行、不公布盗国贼海外资产；卖台贼很可能与中共做交易，牺牲台湾人的利益！
