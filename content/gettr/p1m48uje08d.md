8/10/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: In about 2007, Xiao Yaqing, former Minister of Industry and Information Technology, bragged to me that Communist China would become the world's number one in chips. One of Xiao Yaqing’s family members whose surname is Kuang spent money like crazy because their family was very rich, and this is one of the reasons why Xiao Yaqing was bound to be arrested.

8/10/2022 文贵盖特：肖亚庆在2007年左右跟文贵吹牛说，中共国在芯片领域会成为世界第一；肖亚庆的一位姓邝的家人花钱很疯狂，因为他们家很有钱，这就是肖亚庆必被抓的原因之一
