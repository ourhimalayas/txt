人要识善恶辨真假
所有的人，还有高低之分、贵族之分、贫贱之分，关键的问题，你是否能坚持你自己，还有一个，能真正的辨真假，识善恶，这是根本的问题。你一生念起，一生恶念和善念，都会给你算账的。不信试试。

To differentiate between true and false as well as good and evil 
Whether superior or inferior, whether noble or humble, whether rich or poor, the most critical thing is whether you can stay true to yourself. On top of that is the ability to differentiate between true and false, and good and evil. This is fundamental.  It was said: “Your life begins with your thought”. In the end, you will be judged by all your good thoughts and evil thoughts.  Don’t believe it and see what happens.
