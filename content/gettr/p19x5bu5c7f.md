5/15/2022 Miles Guo: The worse Xi's health is, the faster and more ruthless he will attack Taiwan and the crueler he will treat the Chinese. Xi finds Putin a man of words and believes that Communist China belongs to his family. Xi's cruelty and disregard for the life and death of the Chinese people made him the candidate of the CCP's old kleptocrats. The books Xi reads reflect that he worships dictatorship and treats the Chinese people as the slaves like livestock. He wants the Chinese people to follow the rules and claims that he is the law. This is no different from a mafia.
