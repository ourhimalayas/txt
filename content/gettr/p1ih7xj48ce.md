7/15/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Can you imagine people are beaten to death, get paralyzed, suffer vision loss or miscarriages from police assault, just because they want to withdraw their own money from banks? Yes this happened in Communist China! Even so, the CCP insists it is the greatest Party and Lao Baixing should be grateful to it! The CCP committed genocide in Xinjiang, but “Xi the Sun” shameless declared that all ethnic groups in Communist China are living in harmony!

7/15/2022文贵盖特：只有在中共国才会出现去银行取你自己的钱，却被打死打残打瞎胎死腹中的情形；就这，还要喊党伟大，还要老百姓感谢党！共产党在新疆种族大屠杀，习太阳居然说民族和谐！
