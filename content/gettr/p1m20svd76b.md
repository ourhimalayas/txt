8/10/2022 Miles Guo: Xi's third term will be beneficial for us to take down the CCP! Xi amended the Constitution too early, and he was ruined by Wang Huning and Li Zhanshu. Xi did not take into account that Wang Qishan could not be used nor killed, he did not expect Meng Jianzhu and Sun Lijun to go against him, and he didn't even expect that Zeng Qinghong has so much strength and that there is a group of capable people in the CCP. Xi has aggravated all the CCP members, and he can only bite the bullet and carry on. So, Xi must fight every single day just to survive one more day.

8/10/2022 文贵直播：习第3次“连任”有利于灭共！习修宪太早，他被王沪宁和栗战书给毁了；习没考虑到王岐山既不能用，又不能杀，没想到孟建柱和孙力军有反心，他更未料到曾庆红有强大实力且党内还有一帮能人；习得罪了整个共产党，他只能硬着头皮走下去，能活一天就斗一天
