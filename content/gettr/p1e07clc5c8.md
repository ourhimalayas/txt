6/12/2022 Miles Guo: Recent personnel changes in the CCP reflect that Zeng Qinghong and Meng Jianzhu still have power. Although Wang Qishan's health is failing, he still has ambitions and told his American friend to see him in Beijing after the 20th Party Congress. Communist China may experience natural disasters, wars, military coups, or political revolutions this year. As long as one of these happens, the CCP will be finished. This year is a great year for the Whistleblowers’ Movement, and the best time will be the second half of the next year.
