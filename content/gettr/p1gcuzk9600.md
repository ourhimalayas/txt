If there are more floods in China in 2022, there will be a food crisis in 2023.
On June 28, Mr. Miles Guo blew the whistle that the food crisis timing can  be determined in the next three weeks. If more floods are coming, there will be a serious food crisis from May to August 2023, and millions or even tens of millions of people may die of starvation. If the floods did not cause a catastrophic disaster, the best outcome is that millions of people die of starvation. The probability of the Three Gorges dam failure is very small, but if the small dams downstream of the Three Gorges fail to function, many people will face death and food crisis. The world is facing a food crisis in the future, including Hong Kong and Taiwan. We have to be prepared for the  coming crises.
