U.S. Department of State says Taiwan Strait is international waters

Citing related media reports on June 15, the U.S. State Department said Tuesday (14) that the Taiwan Strait is international waters, guaranteed by international law in terms of freedom of navigation and flight, which is a further retort by the U.S. to mainland China's claim to sovereignty over the Taiwan Strait. The Taiwan Strait is international waters, which means it is subject to the principle of freedom of the high seas and is guaranteed by international law in terms of freedom of navigation and flight. Freedom of navigation and flight are guaranteed by international law.
