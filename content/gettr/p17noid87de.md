4/29/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Liao Guoxun, the mayor of Tianjin, was executed; a bunch of people got arrested this morning, including those who worked at the Ministry of Railways, Customs Office, Wang Qishan’s buddies at PBOC, and HNA personnels; this is not a political infighting, it’s indeed the “political movement,” which has never been stopped since the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party!

4/29/2022 文贵盖特：天津市长廖国勋是被做掉的；今天国内又抓了一批人，有原铁道部的、海关的、还有王岐山在人民银行的哥们儿，海航的，这不叫政治斗争，这叫政治运动，从有中共那天起就没停过！
