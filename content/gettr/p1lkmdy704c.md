8/7/2022 Miles Guo: Fellow fighters, never forget the benefits of not being unvaccinated against COVID! A fellow fighter who was arrested was not beaten by the CCP police, because the policewoman followed the advice of the Whistleblowers' Movement and didn’t take the COVID shot. Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, tweeted "End the CCP" due to the threats posed by the COVID vaccine. Some time ago, the countries in the southern hemisphere told Wang Yi during his visit that they would unite against the CCP if the COVID vaccine can cause a 3-5% mortality rate.

8/7/2022 文贵直播：战友们千万别忘了没打疫苗的好处！国内被抓的战友未受皮肉之苦是因为女警察听了爆料革命而没打疫苗；推特创始人杰克·多西因中共疫苗的威胁而发推说“结束中共”；前段时间，南半球诸国告诉来访的王毅，若疫苗造成3-5%的人死亡，他们会团结起来对付中共！
