【Miles Grand Live】6/22/2022: The CCP's qualification as the agent on behalf of the Swamp has been revoked. The Swamp believes that both Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan are over, and they're talking to several major families of the CCP senior cadres about who will be in charge of China in the future. As long as they can push democracy and rule of law in China, the Swamp will make sure they keep their wealth. The unprecedented unification of finance, unification of political systems, the digitalized era, the AI era, and the era of technology are coming. Only will those who didn't take the COVID jabs have the right to make their voice heard.

【文贵大直播】6/22/2022：中共担任“沼泽地”代理人的资格已被取消，“沼泽地”认为习和王都完了，他们正跟中共几大家族谈谁来接管，只要能进行民主和法治化，可保住他们的钱；世界前所未有的金融统一、政权统一、数字化、AI时代和科技时代到来，只有无苗族才有话语权！
