8/7/2022 Miles Guo: Xi Jinping doesn't feel safe at all. Xi has built 3 security bunkers in Beidaihe and asked her daughter to get married before the 20th Party Congress. Xi's comment on a secret document, "Whoever plays with fires will die in the grave", had a typo, which became a joke inside the CCP, and it turned out that the first person who was told about it was Dai Yongge, a CCP businessman in London. The CCP has no capabilities to fight the US, invade Taiwan, or develop high tech. The CCP will face technological and financial decoupling, and the CCP cadres' families abroad will be deported, with their assets seized.

8/7/2022 文贵直播：习毫无安全感，他在北戴河建了3个安全碉堡，并催女儿在20大前结婚；习的一句"玩火者自坟"成党内笑柄，而第一个得知的竟是远在伦敦的戴永革；中共无力对付美国、打台湾或玩高科技，中共将面临科技和金融的脱钩，中共海外家人将被遣返，其海外资产将被查封
