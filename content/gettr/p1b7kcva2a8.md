The biggest blow to the Chinese Communist Party to completely change the pattern of China, U.S. and Taiwan is Yes
On May 24, Mr. Guo blew the whistle on Gettr that all the changes in the world pattern of China, the United States, and Taiwan, and the Taiwan policy is one word: President Biden's "Yes". This word the biggest blow to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) , and the second sentence is even more terrifying, " That's the commitment we made", which completely changes the policy of  strategic ambiguity towards Taiwan. This was the most important historic moment for Taiwan, and the CCP was forced to adjust its policy toward Taiwan - encircling rather than fighting. God bless Taiwan!
