7/6/2022 Miles Guo: The data leak proves that China's population is only 1 billion, not the 1.4 billion claimed by the CCP, which is consistent with the information exposed by the New Federal State of China earlier. It indicates that the economic data published by Communist China and some western media are fake. China will soon face the issues of an aging population. The exposure of several hundred million people's privacy will have a significant impact on their social mentality.

7/6/2022 文贵直播：中共泄露的数据证明中共国目前人口只有10亿，而非官宣的14亿，这与新中国联邦之前的爆料完全吻合。同时说明过去流氓媒体和中共官方的经济数据都是假的。而中共国也将快速进入老龄化。泄露的数据因曝光了几亿人的隐私而改变了他们的社会心态。
