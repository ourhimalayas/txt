Multiple media and platforms reported the 2nd anniversary celebration of the New Federal State of China (NFSC)
On June 15, multiple media and platforms reported or reprinted the 2nd anniversary celebration of the NFSC with the headline "Peter Navarro, Steve Bannon, and Connie Morgan Joined Miles Guo to Celebrate the 2nd Anniversary of the NFSC ". On June 10, Mr. Miles Guo pinpointed that the CCP‘s extermination depends on power and strength. The ceremony is a manifestation of the strength and confidence. Many countries have witnessed our capability to fulfill our promises, have more confidence to support us. The participation of Morgan and Rothschild families confirmed the fact and countless forces chose to stand with us. People from NFSC, action, action, and action!
