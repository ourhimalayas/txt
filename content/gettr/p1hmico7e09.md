7/8/2022 Miles Guo:  It is sick for some people in mainland China to feel happy when Mr. Shinzo Abe is assassinated. Their behavior is the outcome of being brainwashed by the CCP's propaganda for years. A country or a nation will not have any future if it hopes to build its rise on someone else's death, neither will it earn any respect from the rest of the world.

7/8/2022 文贵直播：中国人对安倍遇刺而感到高兴是一种心理变态的表现，是中国共产党多年舆论洗脑的结果。一个希望以别人的死来换来自己的强大的国家和民族是没有希望，也是不值得被尊重的。
