5/15/2022 Miles Guo: It is no coincidence that the media simultaneously exposed Xi and Putin have health issues. The Shanghai gang is no more, but there is an anti-Xi gang, which must ally with the US and me to take out Xi. Wang Qishan leaked the information that Xi has health issues and manipulated the propaganda to advocate for Li Keqiang, while Xi intentionally took the bait. The revelation that Xi's health is in trouble fits into the current US strategy to take out both Xi and Putin!

5/15/2022 文贵直播：媒体同时爆出习和普京身体不好的消息绝非巧合；上海帮已不复存在，但有反习帮，它必须拉拢文贵和美国才能灭习；王岐山泄漏习身体抱恙的信息并操纵了捧李克强的宣传，而习却有意上钩；曝光习抱病符合美国当前灭习和普京的战略！
