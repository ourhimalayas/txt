4/28/2022 Miles Guo: Shanghai is waiting for food and supplies, and the lockdown will be lifted in Shanghai. Some areas of Beijing are under lockdown, and the entire Beijing will go on lockdown soon.

Anomalies occur before the advent of disasters, and the same happened before the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war.
