8/11/2022 Miles Guo: I believe the deaths of Liu Wenxi and his wife is a consequence of COVID vaccination, and have nothing to do with the brutal attack on the four girls in Tangshan. Tangshan is under the control of Yao's family and Wang Qishan, and Liu Wenxi didn't dare to irritate Wang Qishan. The most recent lockdowns on Hainan and Tibet are pure political operations by the CCP for the purpose of testing the fidelity of local governments to the central government. It is not related to the current situations in the South China Sea and the Sino-Indian border.

8/11/2022  文贵直播： 我相信唐山刘文玺和他老婆是打了中共毒疫苗去世的， 和唐山殴打四女事件无关，唐山是姚家和王岐山的地盘，刘文玺不敢招惹王岐山。中共近日在海南和西藏等地的封城是政治行动，是中央对地方忠诚度的测试，和南海及中印边界局势无关。
