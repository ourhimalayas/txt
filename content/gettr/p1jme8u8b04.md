7/24/2022 Miles Guo: Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan will be of great significance if it comes true. Her visit will imply that the U.S. recognizes Taiwan as a sovereign state, and it will set a good example for other U.S. politicians and officials to visit Taiwan in the future. Meanwhile, NATO and Japan will rationalize their joint defense of Taiwan. Given the stakes here,  Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan might not take place. Area within 1000 km located to the west of Fujian in mainland China will be struck if the CCP wages war against Taiwan

7/24/2022 文贵直播：佩罗西若成功访问台湾则意义重大。她的访问意味着美国事实承认台湾独立，为今后美国政要访问台湾立了榜样，同时在军事上使得北约和日本顺理成章地协防台湾；佩罗西访台成功机率不大；如果台海一旦开战，福建以西1000公里都会成为打击范围
