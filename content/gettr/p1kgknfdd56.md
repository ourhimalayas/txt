7/30/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Nancy’s Pelosi’s potential trip to Taiwan triggered a blame game within the CCP. The principle of the Whistleblowers’ Movement is that no matter how the CCP and the U.S. fight or make deals, they should not use the interest and security of Chinese and Taiwanese people as bargaining chips. The Whistleblowers’ Movement will show the world who are the CCP’s running dogs and who have been suppressing and betraying Chinese people.

7/30/2022 文贵盖特：中共内部为了佩洛西访台开始互掐。爆料革命的立场是，无论中共和美国怎么打怎么勾兑，都不要拿中国人和台湾人的安全和利益做筹码。爆料革命会让世界看到谁是中共的走狗，谁在欺压和背叛中国人民。
