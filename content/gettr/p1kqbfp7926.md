8/1/2022 Miles Guo: Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is of paramount significance! Even if a brief stay by Pelosi in Taiwan would make the Chinese Communist Party a laughing stock around the world. The CCP will no longer earn the respect of any country. The CCP would not dare to do anything about Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, but it would only incite nationalist sentiments at home!

8/1/2022 文贵直播: 佩洛西访台意义重大！她哪怕只在台湾短暂停留，中共也会沦为全世界的笑柄，不会再赢得任何一个国家的尊重！中共对佩洛西登台一事不敢有丝毫作为，只会在国内煽动民族主义情绪！
