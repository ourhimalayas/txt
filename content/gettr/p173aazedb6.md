4/24/2022 Miles Guo: Nancy Pelosi has the incentive to visit Taiwan while she is still in power, and her visit will aid the midterm elections. Nancy Pelosi certainly can see through the CCP's trick of having her postpone the visit. There is a high chance that it will be a sudden and unanticipated visit!

4/24/2022 文贵直播: 出访台湾既是因为南希. 佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）有这个权力，也是为了在中期大选中拉选票。南希.佩洛西看透了中共要她推迟出访的诡计，所以很大概率会突访台湾！
