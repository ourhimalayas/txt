4/24/2022 Ukraine Rescue: Ever since erecting the 6-meter-high billboard at the rescue camp in Medyka, there have been people who not only verbally abused our fellow fighters, but also attempted to hit and almost injured them. While they had to apologize to us afterwards, they have repeatedly twisted the facts, and the citizens of the New Federal State of China will definitely investigate this matter to the end!

4/24/2022 乌克兰救援连线：自从把6米高的广告牌在梅迪卡救援营地竖起来后，就有人不仅言语辱骂，而且还动手差点伤到战友。虽然他们事后不得已道歉了，但却一再地歪曲事实，新中国联邦人定会将此事追查到底！
