8/3/2022 Miles Guo: I am the first one to tell the world that the US, Australia, and Japan very much want the CCP to start the war. Because they are very clear that if they don't take down the CCP, they will be destroyed by the CCP instead; Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan is backed by the bipartisan consensus after evaluating the national and military strategy of the US. The Americans are very clear that the CCP is an utter crook and has no support from the people.

8/3/2022 文贵直播：文贵是世界上第一个说出，美国、澳大利亚和日本非常希望中共首先开战，因为它们很清楚，若不尽快灭共，它们就会被中共灭掉；南希·佩洛西访台是美国两党基于国家战略军事评估后的一致决定，美国人很清楚在民心上，中共是彻头彻尾的骗子。
