6/3/2022 Miles Guo: The Himalaya Coin is the only digital coin in the world that was paid for by the institutional investors prior to its launch. The Himalaya Coin is backed by the New Federal State of China, which brings it the biggest value. The Himalaya Coin has a limited number of issued coins and unlimited circulation and is connected with the absolute stablecoin, the Himalaya Dollar. Transactions and payments can be done absolutely instantly via the Himalaya Pay, and the Himalaya Coin is pegged with enormous credit backed by the market after the New Federal State of China takes down the CCP. How can the Himalaya Coin be worthless?

6/3/2022 文贵直播：喜币是世界上唯一在上市前就有机构投资者付钱的数字货币，喜币有新中国联邦是其最大价值所在；喜币发行量有限而流通无限，喜币和绝对稳定的喜美元连通、有绝对可即时使用的喜支付以及新中国联邦灭共后的市场的巨大信用锚定，喜币能不值钱吗？
