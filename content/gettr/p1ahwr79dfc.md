Nicole is interviewing Adam, a volunteer from the US. Adam agreed: communism destroyed human will and creativity. It's basically rewarded the lack of creativity in people and rewarded people to just follow orders. He said if we don't stop the Chinese Communist Party, it will control the whole world. Therefore this is a completely global problem. He encouraged members of the New Federal State of China to stay strong and keep fighting and peacefully.
尼科尔正在采访来自美国的志愿者亚当。亚当同意：共产主义摧毁了人的意志和创造力。它基本上是奖励人们缺乏创造力，奖励人们只是服从命令。他说如果我们不阻止中国共产党，它将控制整个世界。所以这完全是一个全球性的问题。他鼓励新中国联邦人保持坚强，继续和平地战斗。
