6/3/2022 Miles Guo: We have been commemorating Qu Yuan, who was wronged and committed suicide by jumping into the Miluo River, for thousands of years. However, no Chinese have asked how many people have committed suicide by jumping into rivers or jumping off the buildings in China this year. The Dragon Boat Festival should actually be dedicated to the commemoration of Wu Zixu, a politician of the State of Wu in the Spring and Autumn period. But in Communist China, people like Wu Zixu, who understands what evilness is about, will all be put into the Qincheng Prison.

6/3/2022 文贵直播：我们纪念屈原蒙冤跳江几千年了，却没有中国人问今年有多少人跳江或跳楼自杀；端午节其实是纪念伍子胥的，可在中共国像伍子胥这样懂得什么是邪恶的人都会被关进秦城
