7/14/2022 Miles Guo: Several senior executives of some top ten banks in Communist China just fled the country and told me that over 50% of the debt, accounts, and notes of the banks in Communist China are fake. The CCP's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) ordered that finance and real estate cannot be in crisis before the 20th Party Congress. Otherwise, the senior bank executives will be arrested. So, they had no choice but to flee Communist China, and they also said that there were many supporters of the Whistleblowers' Movement in mainland China.

7/14/2022 文贵直播：中共国10大银行的几位银行高管刚刚逃出来，他们告诉文贵，中共国银行超过50%的债务、账务和票据是假的；中纪委要求20大前金融和房地产不能出事，否则就抓银行高管，于是他们只能逃离中共国，他们还说国内有很多人都是爆料革命的支持者
