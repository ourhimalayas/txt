7/9/2022 Miles Guo's GETTR: Luc A. Despins, partner of Paul Hastings LLP, was appointed as the new trustee in Miles Guo's bankruptcy case. This is fishy! At least half of Paul Hastings LLP’s revenue comes from Communist China and its clients include HNA, Ping An, Bruno Wu and Lan Yang. Do you see any conflict of interest here?

7/9/2022 文贵盖特：普衡合伙人Luc A. Despins被任命为文贵破产案的新受托人，这里面有啥猫腻？普衡大半收入来自中共国，客户包括海航、平安、吴征钥匙澜等，这难道不是利益冲突吗？
