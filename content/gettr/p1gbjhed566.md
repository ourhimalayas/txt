6/28/2022 Miles Guo: The people in the Swamp believe that whether or not Xi Jinping invades Taiwan does not matter at all, because Xi and Wang will be gone. The Swamp is far more powerful than the ordinary people in influencing others, but there are so many things that they can't achieve as well. The Swamp wants to work with us, but we have nothing to ask from them. Without the Swamp, we can also take down the CCP. Unlike the Swamp, we, the citizens of the New Federal State of China, are going to take the path with sunshine.

6/28/2022 文贵直播：沼泽地认为习打不打台湾已不重要，没有习和王了！沼泽地影响别人的权力是超出常人的，但他们也有太多做不了的事；沼泽地想要和我们合作，但我们并非有求于他们；没有沼泽地，我们照样能灭共；新中国联邦人要走一条和沼泽地不一样的阳光之地的路
