6/24/2022 Miles Guo:  In the CCP's detention center, there are various ways to torture someone to death, and the worst two are to starve you to death or make you die through mental inflictions. Several people related to Xiao Jianhua already died from mental inflictions, and Xiao Jianhua himself became mentally unstable; in mainland China, flooding, food shortage and COVID vaccine disasters are beyond your imagination. Be ready to shed lots of tears in the next 2-3 years.

6/24/2022 文贵直播：中共看守所里有各种被折磨死，包括精神死和饿死，和肖建华有关的几个人都已精神死，老肖也疯了；国内的水灾、粮荒和疫苗灾难无法想象，未来两三年就等着流泪吧
