7/8/2022 Miles Guo: I ask those Chinese who express their happiness over Abe's death to search their souls, what causes their behaviors? Abe was tragically assassinated because he lost his PM privileges after he left office, while a retired subnational official in Communist China can still enjoy all his privileges and the money he spends is enough to support 4 million poor people. What a stark contrast!

7/8/2022 文贵直播：那些因安倍晋三被刺杀而高兴的中国人应扪心自问，为什么会有这样的行为？正因为日本首相退休后不再享受任何特权，安倍才遇害，而中共国的一个副国级官员退休后依然享受特权，并且一年的花费能养活400万的贫困人口，这是何等的差距啊！
