03/16/2023 At the press conference of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, the spokesperson paused for a few seconds when asked by Reuters about Mr. Miles Guo's so-called "$1 billion fraud".

03/16/2023 在中共外交部新闻发布会上，对于路透社关于郭文贵先生所谓“10亿美元的诈骗罪”的提问，发言人停了好几秒之后，不仅没敢回答问题，而且连话都说不清楚了。随后外交部官网上的文字稿还对发言人简短的几个字进行了修改。为什么中共如此惧怕郭文贵先生?
