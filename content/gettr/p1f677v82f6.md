Xi, the Sun, imitates Putin, the King’s “Special Martial Operation” with “No-war Military Operation”
George Orwell indicated in his famous novel “1984" that totalitarian regimes are notorious for making new terms to replace existing stuff or concepts aiming to confuse public options and rationalize their own crimes.
Xi and his crazy buddy, Putin are kidnapping their people to establish a “thuggish regime” at a speedy pace reversely, making evil excuses for invasion and war externally, military control and suppression internally.
