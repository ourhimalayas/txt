7/22/2022 Miles Guo: Yesterday in the court hearing, Luc Despins claimed what I said was contradictory because I said I trust the US judicial system, which is corrupted by the CCP though. Such a narrative is the same as those of the CCP! What I said has factual bases and has nothing to do with the conflicts of interest of Luc Despins and Paul Hastings with my bankruptcy case. Why did Luc Despins fail to disclose honestly how he and Paul Hastings are connected to the CCP and the PAG? Why did they make false statements?

7/22/2022 文贵直播：昨天卢克在庭审上说文贵自相矛盾，一面说相信美国司法，另一面却说美国司法被中共渗透，这种论调和中共如出一辙！文贵所说都基于事实，而这跟卢克、普衡在本案中的利益冲突有关系吗？卢克为何不如实披露他和普衡跟中共以及PAG的关系？为什么要撒谎？
