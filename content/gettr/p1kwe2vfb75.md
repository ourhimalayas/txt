8/2/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Nancy Pelosi and Tsai Ing-wen, two women, changed the world! 
In contrast, Xi Jinping, who was said to be as powerful as the sun, was able to do nothing but watch. Look at what those old shameless traitors of Taiwan were doing! Tsai Ing-wen was able to stand her ground against the pressure from them, and became the most outstanding woman in Chinese history. Taiwanness should be proud of her.

8/2/2022 文贵盖特：佩洛西和蔡英文两位女人改变了世界！相比之下，如太阳一般厉害的习近平束手无策只能瞪眼看着。那些老不要脸的卖台贼在干什么？蔡英文顶住了卖台贼的压力，成为了中国历史上最牛的女人，值得台湾人骄傲
