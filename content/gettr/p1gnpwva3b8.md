7/1/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The entire world took the CCP’s show in Hong Kong as a joke, and it is pathetic that Chinese Lao Baixing feel elated about the show and still live in a delusion. Chinese people are so forgetful of disasters such as the recent flooding, the lockdown and the tragedy of the “chained woman”. They tend to think that bad things will only happen to others; Next there will be a global ban on the enterprises and financial institutions of Communist China, and a cleanup of the CCP’s infiltrations in the academics, intellectual community and the R&D sector.

7/1/2022 文贵盖特：中共在香港的表演让全世界感到荒唐可笑，可悲的是老百姓还在集体意淫，他们忘了水灾、封城和锁链女，以为坏事只发生在别人身上；接下来全世界将封杀中共企业和金融，并清洗中共在教育界、知识界和科研领域的渗透
