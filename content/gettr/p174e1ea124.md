4/24/2022 Miles Guo: The biggest possibility after the CCP invades Taiwan is that it will be destroyed instantaneously, and the U.S. aircraft carriers will dock in Taiwan in the long run. The so-called virus outbreak in Taiwan now is actually the COVID vaccine disaster, and the Whistleblowers' Movement was the first to say that the vaccine mandate would be halted by May 2022. The CCP pays people to get the COVID jabs and demands that people over 60 be vaccinated against COVID. Such wickedness couldn't be more obvious!

4/24/2022 文贵直播：中共打台湾最大的可能性是瞬间被灭，美国航母将长期停靠台湾；台湾现在的所谓疫情其实是疫苗灾难，爆料革命最早说出2022年5月前疫苗强制令会停；中共给钱并要求60岁以上的人打疫苗，这种邪恶再明显不过了！
