6/24/2022 Miles Guo: The incident of the assault on female diners in Tangshan has been happening everywhere and every day in Communist China. Why does the CCP turn a blind eye to it? The CCP is the largest mafia in Communist China, and its so-called anti-mafia operations are all about politics. Those street gangsters are actually the mad dogs released by the CCP to attack the Chinese people! Once the CCP is taken down, none of these tragedies will happen.

6/24/2022 文贵直播：唐山事件在中共国天天发生，共产党为什么放任自流？中共的所谓打黑都有政治目的，共产党才是最大的黑社会，所谓黑社会就是共产党放出来咬人的疯狗！灭了共，这一切都不会发生！
