7/13/2022 Miles Guo: In order to wipe out or buy out the leaked data of 1 billion Chinese people, the CCP established a state security emergency taskforce and went so far as to hack some cloud servers that store the data and certain power plants. The leaked data of 1 billion Chinese people also indicates that Communist China's past economic data, such as GDP, was fabricated. Thus, Communist China's sovereign ratings and its economic statistics will be re-evaluated, and the world's credit system will collapse.

7/13/2022 文贵直播：为黑掉或买掉泄露的十亿人数据，中共成立了国家安全紧急小组，竟然黑客了一些储存数据的云服务器和发电站；这十亿人数据的泄露说明中共国过去的GDP等经济数据是假的，因此，中共国的国家主权评级和经济数据会被世界重新看待，世界信用体系将解体
