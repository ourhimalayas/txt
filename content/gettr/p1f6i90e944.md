5/29/2022 Miles Guo: The entire family of Yan Fuqing, a famous Chinese medical practitioner, were killed by the CCP. Yan and others invited to dinner by Mao all ended up miserably. Yan Fuqing was the first to advocate for the idea of "Western medicine as application, Chinese medicine as the foundation". But Yan didn't go to Taiwan and declined the protection offered by the Americans and the Skull and Bones at Yale. This shows the shortcoming of the Chinese intellectuals - they can sacrifice their own and others' lives to gain reputation. Unfortunately, they were the ones who were killed the most during the Cultural Revolution.
