4/24/2022 Miles Guo: On the one hand, "Xi the Sun" wants to take over TSMC's technologies for the benefit of the CCP, and on the other hand, he wants to take out the chip supply chain to put the world economy in trouble for the sake of destroying the US dollar. I think this is just a fool's daydream, and the CCP can't achieve either of these two goals.

4/24/2022 文贵直播: 习太阳一方面想把台积电的技术为中共所用，另一方面想通过干掉芯片供应链从而使世界经济出问题以灭掉美元。文贵认为这不过是痴人说梦，中共一样也做不到！
