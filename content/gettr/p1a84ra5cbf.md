5/15/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP spent 20 billion USD in attacking the Whistleblowers' Movement and myself, including hacking and altering data on YouTube and Getter, buying off former senior official of FBI, intimidating and bribing BBC etc.; however the CCP cannot continue like this anymore, because what happened to me is equal to an attack on the Americans, it is a warfare at the state level!

5/15/2022 文贵直播：中共花200亿美元攻击文贵和爆料革命：包括篡改YouTube和Gettr数据，买通前FBI高管，威胁利诱BBC等；但共产党现在玩不下去了，因为文贵的遭遇等同于对美国人的攻击，视为国家战争行为！
