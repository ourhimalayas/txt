【Ukraine Rescue】 05/21/2022 Tom, a volunteer from the United States, expresses: No one understands "oppression" better than the Chinese people, and it's great that you are speaking out for the freedom of the Chinese people; people need a voice, and the more people who can stand up for their rights and speak out, the more you can achieve your goal; wish you the best in that effort to eliminate the CCP!

【乌克兰救援】 05/21/2022 一位来自美国的志愿者汤姆表示：没有人比中国人民更理解何为“压迫”，你们能为中国人民的自由而大声疾呼非常棒；人们需要有一个声音，越多的人能够站出来争取其权利并大声疾呼，就一定能达到目的；衷心希望你们达成灭共目标！
