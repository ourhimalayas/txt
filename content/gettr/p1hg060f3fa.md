7/6/2022 Miles Guo: From the 1920s-1940s, the once affluent and advanced northeastern provinces of China were betrayed by the world again and again, and the northeasterners became the victims of the savage looting from the former Soviet Red Army; if it were not for the economic backing of the three northeastern provinces, the CCP would have come to its demise within 10 years after it took power in 1949!

7/6/2022 文贵直播：从20世纪20年代到40年代，曾经富庶、先进的中国东北三省一次又一次被世界所出卖，致使东北人遭到前苏联红军惨无人道的洗劫；1949年中共窃取政权后，如果没有东北三省的经济做后盾，中共根本活不过十年！
