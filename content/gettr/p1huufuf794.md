7/10/2022 Miles Guo: The Chinese Communist Party has loaned hundreds of billions of yuan to the Rajapaksa family in Sri Lanka regardless of the fact that many Chinese people are starving. Sri Lanka's bankruptcy will trigger the subsequent bankruptcy of 40 to 60 countries, but sadly the Chinese people will be the most hated people. This is called the phenomenon of the collapse of socialism.

7/10/2022 文贵直播：中共贷给了斯里兰卡拉贾帕克萨家族几千亿人民币，却不顾自己人民的死活；这次斯里兰卡的国家破产将引发40到60个国家的破产，而最糟恨的却会是中国人，悲哀啊！这叫做为社会主义倒闭现象
