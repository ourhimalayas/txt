8/10/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The CCP had a journalist from Asia Weekly write an article smearing me for telling the US to launch a war against the CCP, but I have never said such a thing and have never hoped the CCP would attack the US. In contrast, the CCP was lying through its teeth. The so-called trustee, Luc Despins, is now fully representing the CCP, and Paul Hastings LLP has been removing a lot of information on its website about its ties to the CCP. So, what are they afraid of?

8/10/2022 文贵盖特：中共找了《亚洲周刊》的一个记者撰文污蔑文贵告诉美国打中共，文贵从未说过此话，也从未希望中共打美国，中共在瞪眼撒谎；所谓受托人卢克现已完全代表了中共，而普衡律所竟然在大量删除其网站上关于它跟中共有关的信息，它们在怕什么呢？
