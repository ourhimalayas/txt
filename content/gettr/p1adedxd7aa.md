5/18/2022 Miles Guo: Tether is controlled by Wang Qishan, the people behind Lufax like Peter Ma Mingzhe, and the Wall Street guys. Tether's purpose is to push the internationalization of the digital RMB. Tether is the CCP's risk hedging mechanism by serving as an alternative form of the US dollar following the CCP-US decoupling.
