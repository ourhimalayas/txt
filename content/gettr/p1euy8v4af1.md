U.S. senators introduce Taiwan Policy Act to designate Taiwan as a major non-NATO ally
On June 17,  A duo of U.S. senators introduced the "Taiwan Policy Act of 2022" bill to significantly adjust U.S. policy toward Taiwan, provide billions of dollars in security assistance, and designate Taiwan as a major non-NATO ally. The act marks the most comprehensive restructuring of U.S. policy toward Taiwan since the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. On June 12, Miles Guo blew the whistle that U.S.-China Defense Chiefs' talks in Singapore were an ultimatum before the war, U.S. and Europe would legislate to protect Taiwan, and U.S., Japan, UK, Europe, Australia and Canada would take full-scale action as long as Taiwan is endangered. The world's legal extermination of the CCP began！
