7/24/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP's fear of our military intel exposure is comparable to that of the 419 VOA broadcast cut-off, the 717 exposure of Wang Qishan and HNA, and the 1120 exposure of Wang Jian's death! Why didn't the US and Japan share this military intel with Taiwan? Contrary to the indifference demonstrated by Taiwan, NATO showed unusual eagerness towards our military intel. Why?

7/24/2022 文贵直播：中共对我们军事爆料的恐惧程度不亚于当年的419VOA断播、717爆料王岐山海航和1120对王健死因的爆料！为何美日掌握的共匪军事情报未分享给台湾？与台湾的冷漠相反，北约对我们的军事情报表示了超常的关注，为什么？
