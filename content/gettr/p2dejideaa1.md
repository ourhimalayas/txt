04/03/2023 Nicole's interview on The John Fredericks Show: The Chinese Communist Party never intended to play fair with the United States, their ultimate goal is to take down and take over the United States. Whether the CCP has a good personal relationship with President Trump is a personal issue. But if President Trump were to run for president in 2024 and become a presidential candidate again, it would be a major threat to the CCP because President Trump's policies are very tough on Communist China. #FreeMilesGuo #FreeYvetteWang
04/03/2023 妮可接受《约翰·弗雷德里克斯秀》采访：中共从来不打算与美国公平竞争，他们的最终目标是打倒并接管美国。中共是否与川普总统有个人层面的良好关系属于个人问题，但如果川普总统要竞选2024年的总统，再次成为总统候选人，就会成为对中共的一个重大威胁，因为川普总统的政策对中共非常强硬。 #释放郭文贵 #释放王雁平
