4/29/2022 Miles Guo's GETTR: Hong Kong's foreign debts and loans will implode! The financial system of the CCP can no longer sustain. The CCP's so-called incentive plan, Closed-Loop economy and mega-infrastructure plan will only expedite its demise. One objective of the CCP's lockdown and stress limit test is to confine Lao Baixing to their homes when the economy implodes, so that they won't be able to withdraw money from banks. Lao Baixing will be grateful to the CCP as long as they can survive. COVID vaccine mandate is the CCP's means to depopulate. Taking down the CCP is the only way for Chinese people to survive and live a good life!

4/29/2022 文贵盖特：香港的外债、贷款要爆大雷！中共国的金融系统真撑不住了，所谓的激励计划内循环和大搞基建只会让中共死得更快。中共大搞封城压力测试意在经济崩塌时让老百姓待在家里无法取钱，且只要能活下去就对中共感恩戴德。强制打疫苗是中共减少人口的手段。
