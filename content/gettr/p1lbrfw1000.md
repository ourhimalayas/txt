8/5/2022  Miles Guo: We lost again at the hearing yesterday, but we have many grounds for appeal, and one of them will succeed for sure! In America, we must absolutely respect judges and abide by court verdicts unconditionally, but we reserve the right to appeal. When facing challenges, we must stay calm and avoid getting emotional, and do not complain and blame. A law-abiding virtue is something we must possess.

8/5/2022  文贵直播： 昨天的听证我们又输了，但我们有许多方面可以上诉，必定有一个会成功！在美国，我们一定要对法官绝对尊重，对判决要绝对执行，但我们保留上诉的权利。在挫折面前，要冷静，不要情绪化和怨天尤人，遵守法律是一种我们必须有的道德。
