8/2/2022 Miles Guo: The kleptocrats in Taiwan take bribery from the CCP and work on behalf of it. They are no longer qualified to represent Taiwan. Those who protested Nancy Pelosi in Taiwan and the U.S. would not dare to protest in Communism China. Chinese people don't get it that the union of Taiwan and Communist China won't benefit them a tiny bit. Only Miles Guo and the Whistleblowers' Movement knew all the details of Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.

8/2/2022 文贵直播：台湾老杂毛政客收钱替中共办事，已没有资格代表台湾；敢在台湾和美国抗议南希·佩洛西的人却不敢去中共国抗议；中共统治下的中国人没想明白台湾回归大陆对他们没有任何好处；全人类只有文贵和爆料革命知道佩洛西的访台计划。
