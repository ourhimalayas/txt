7/18/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: Does the disclosure of the CCP’s classified military intel have anything to do with the Chinese people? If so, what’s the relevance? If you understand the significance of those classified military documents, you will realize that the Chinese Communist Party is extremely evil to the extent that they hide their military facilities in downtown areas, kindergartens, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, and civilian residences. So, the CCP uses the Chinese people as its shield.

7/18/2022 文贵盖特：爆中共的军事情报和中国人有没有关系？有什么关系？看懂军事文件，你就能看懂共产党邪恶至极，能把军事设施隐藏在闹市、幼儿园、学校、养老院、医院和民宅之中，中共把老百姓当成了他们的肉盾！
