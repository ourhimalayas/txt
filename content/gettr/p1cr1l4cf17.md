If Republicans win midterm elections, Congress will legislate to recognize the New Federal State of China
On June 4, Mr.  Miles Guo blew the whistle that Peter Navarro was arrested on June 3, but he is coming to attend the 2nd anniversary celebration of the New Federal State of China (NFSC). If the Republicans wins the midterm elections in 2022, they will do everything possible in Congress to legislate to recognize the NFSC. It is absolutely impossible for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to control the Congress, we have to make a significant breakthrough in Congress, shock the whole world, and normalize the relationship between the NFSC and the United States. The CCP is waiting for death!
