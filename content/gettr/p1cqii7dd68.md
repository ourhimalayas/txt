【NFSC 2nd Anniversary 】06/04/2022 Miles Guo: The whole world's disasters are caused by the CCP rather than the Chinese. However, people in Wall Street are aiding and abetting the CCP and selling out America. Mr. Bannon and I have been working hard to wake up the world, and that "take down the CCP" has become the No. 1 slogan in the world! We must show the world the good side of the Chinese people. Thanks to America for providing us with security and opportunities. We will never give up and we will win for sure!

【新中国联邦2周年】06/04/2022 郭先生：全世界的灾难是中共而不是中国人造成的，而华尔街却助纣为虐并出卖美国；两年来文贵和班农先生都在努力唤醒全世界，“灭共”已成为世界第一口号！我们要展示中国人好的一面，感谢美国提供给我们安全和机遇，我们永不言弃且一定会赢！
