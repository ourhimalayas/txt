U.S. is lining up to fight China and internally purging the running dogs working for the Chinese  Communist  Party
On May 17, Mr. Guo Wengui blew the whistle on Gettr that the U.S. has deployed troops around the Communist  China and accelerated the internal purge of running dogs who have U.S. passports but work for the Chinese Communist Party(CCP), including the pseudo-democratic deceivers, representatives and agents of foreign financial institutions and joint organizations. As long as they work for the CCP, they are doomed. The United States finally recognizes that the CCP cannot represent Chinese people! The pseudo-democratic deceivers and the white gloves of the CCP are trembling in fear.
