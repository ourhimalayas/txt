7/13/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP’s Xi Jinping-Wang Qishan administration was trying to gain global hegemony by pushing the Belt and Road Initiative. The One Belt One Road initiative will make the CCP lose power, as well as the hearts and minds of the people. The collapse of Sri Lanka is the beginning of a complete failure of the Belt and Road Initiative. Humanity is heading towards disaster because of the Belt and Road Initiative, and the world will soon pay the debt from decades of collusion with the CCP.

7/13/2022 文贵直播：共产党习王政府通过在全球推行一带一路，试图在全球取得霸权。一带一路将让共产党失去政权、失去民心。斯里兰卡的崩塌是一带一路彻底失败的开始，全人类都将因一带一路走向灾难，为和过去几十年世界和共产党的勾兑买单。
