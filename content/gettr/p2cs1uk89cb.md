03/27/2023 Former prosecutor and law professor David Clements: For Mr. Miles Guo, even his home country deadly set against him, where else would he go? So there's no "flight risk" for him, and this case is a white-collar accusation, so he's not a danger to the community,  which makes him a perfect candidate to have bail. The reason he wasn't granted pretrial conditional release was that they wanted to put a muzzle on him, which seemed more like a political hit.

03/27/2023 前检察官、法学教授大卫·克莱门茨：对于郭文贵先生来说，连他的母国都把他视为眼中钉，他还能逃到哪儿去？所以他不存在“潜逃风险”，且本案也是经济犯罪指控，所以他也不会对社区构成危险，因此他完全有资格获得保释。他之所以未被获准审前有条件释放，是因为他们要让他噤声，这看起来更像是一场政治迫害。
