【NFSC 2nd Anniversary】06/04/2022 Miles Guo: The CCP has been frantically deleting data from social media world wide. This is absolutely a state level act! The CCP is so fearful! It was the June 4th incident in 1989 that sowed the seeds for today's Whistleblowers' Movement. The CCP has got itself into a dire situation!

【新中国联邦2周年】06/04/2022 郭先生：共产党最近在全球社交媒体删除数据，这绝对是国家行为！共产党太恐惧了！没有当年的89·64，就不会有今天的爆料革命。共产党已岌岌可危！
