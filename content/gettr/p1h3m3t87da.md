7/4/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The world is gradually waking up even though the darkness has shrouded the world. A European tycoon told me that all the disasters in the world have to do with the CCP and said that only Communist China seeks to destroy the world and take it over. The CCP promised to keep Hong Kong unchanged for 50 years, but it recently denied that it had made such a promise. The CCP also said privately that it wouldn’t invade Taiwan, but it has prepared for everything to completely destroy Taiwan.

7/4/2022 文贵盖特：虽然黑暗已笼罩了世界，但世界正逐渐醒来；欧洲某大佬说全世界所有的灾难都与中共有关系，只有中共国想把这个世界砸烂并据为己有；中共承诺说香港50年不变，可最近却否认做过此承诺；中共私下说不会打台湾，却做好了一切把台湾打烂的准备
