5/8/2022 Miles Guo: There are two things must be accomplished before the official launch of our GEDU program: building effective teams and finalizing educational model. In addition, all software and hardware essentials for online and offline classes must be in place as well. I hope all these preparations can be completed in 6 months to a year. The success of the GEDU cannot be achieved without these necessary preparations. It is just like the mission of taking down the Chinese Communist Party, I wouldn't have gone this far without my 30-year preparation.

5/8/2022  文贵直播：GEDU教育正式启动前必须完成两件事：建立团队和确定教育模式，包括线上线下授课的所有软硬件设施的完善，我希望在半年到一年的时间内完成所有的准备工作。GEDU事业的成功不能缺少这些充足的准备工作，就像灭共事业一样，我做了30年的准备才能走到今天
