【#FreeMilesGuoNow】03/18/2023  Miles Guo is a real man in court, he's in very good spirits. He told us not to worry. He's doing well.  But America is not doing well.  It is the darkest moment of history. Because the very institutions, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the SEC, that are tasked with a legal obligation of protecting Americans, are working with a hostile foreign regime, the CCP, to persecute the CCP’s most wanted enemy, Miles Guo, on American soil. In court, the prosecutors have admitted working with the CCP throughout the investigation on Miles Guo.
