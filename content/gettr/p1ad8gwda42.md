5/18/2022 Miles Guo: The economic conference recently held in Europe was about tracking the assets of Putin, Russian oligarchs, Xi Jinping, and the CCP cadres to prepare for the following extreme sanctions on them. A NATO intelligence official proved what I had previously uncovered about the three CCP’s plans of invading Taiwan. Out of the three plans, to encircle Taiwan but not attack is now considered the first choice. Yellen, who used to be pro-CCP, has undergone a big change in her attitude toward the CCP as a result of the CCP’s internal conflicts. The CCP will certainly end up being terminated by itself.
