6/24/2022 Miles Guo: Those in the Swamp told me about the financial note that was issued 9 years ago with the total being 135 billion dollars, which will be due in 2028. It was Beijing International Trust that offered the note guarantee to Win Eagle Investment Limited, while Deutsche Bank provided the credit guarantee for loans. The numerous financial notes manipulated by the CCP turn out to be the economic nukes that they have dropped to the West. It is extremely difficult to take back the money that belongs to the Chinese people! Wang Qishan has never ever thought about paying back the money!

6/24/2022 文贵直播：“沼泽地”的人告诉文贵9年前的一个共计1350亿美元、2028年到期的票据，北国投给了威益公司票据担保，而德意志银行提供了贷款的信用担保；盗国贼们玩的无数的票据就是他们扔给西方的经济核弹；把属于中国人的钱拿回去太难了！王岐山从未想过要还钱！
