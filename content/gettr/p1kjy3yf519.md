7/31/2022: Miles Guo: The CCP and the U.S. may sign an agreement similar to the Plaza Accord, so that the CCP could survive a bit longer. Such an agreement would lead to further deterioration of the domestic economy, and the falling apart of the CCP's digital RMB, currency basket and Petro-RMB plans, and eventually the CCP has to accept digital USD.

7/31/2022 文贵直播：中共可能会与美国达成一项协议，类似日本当初签署的广场协议，换取中共的苟延残喘。这样的协议会导致国内更严重的经济问题，数字人民币、一篮子币计划、石油人民币的泡汤，以及中共不得不接受数字美元。
