Since March 4th, our fellow fighters from the New Federal State of China gathered in Medyka Border, and have provided humanitarian help. We gained respect and recognition from the international organizations during the 81 full days of rescuing. Our fellow fighters have fought through obstacles, pain, and hardships, and they have come to understand to grow and appreciate life. Although they were threatened by the virus and the CCP, the citizens of the NFSC were still able to overcome those obstacles and spread love. Our yellow vests, big tents, and NFSC coffee, became the landmark of Medyka.

自3月4日始，来自世界各地的新中国联邦战友，汇集在梅迪卡边境实施人道救援。历经81天的战斗，他们得到了甚多国际救援组织的首肯和赞赏。战友们体会颇深，各自发表了自己的心声，有困惑有痛苦有感悟有感恩有成长，冒着病毒的威胁和中共的破坏，表现出了我们新中国人的大爱。我们的灭工马甲，大帐篷和咖啡...成为了一道亮丽的风景线。
