7/2/2022 Miles Guo’s GETTR: The CCP‘s show in Hong Kong has become a global joke, and the celebrities and tycoons in Hong Kong also revealed their shamelessness to the world; no one can stop the arrival of digital currencies; we should always have kind thoughts and the capability to differentiate between true and false, good and evil.

7/2/2022 文贵盖特：共产党在香港的表演成了世界笑话，香港名流的无耻在世人面前暴露无遗；数字货币的到来无人能挡；人要识善恶辨真假，永远心存善念。
