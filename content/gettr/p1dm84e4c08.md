6/10/2022 Miles Guo: The reason I asked you to dig deeper into our June 4th ceremony is to encourage our fellow fighters to get more serious about learning the culture of the NFSC and its essence. Why must we let the entire world know that we have the ability to live a good life? It is because we want to tell the world that all we enjoy in our lives are not granted by the CCP, but through our own efforts.

6/10/2022 文贵直播：让大家深挖“六四”庆典的目的是让战友严肃认真了解新中国联邦的文化和本质。为什么要让全世界知道我们能过好日子？因为我们要告诉所有人，我们享受的一切都不是共产党给的，而是我们自己挣来的！
