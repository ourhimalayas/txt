6/3/2022 Miles Guo: The rivalry between the US and Communist China is inevitable! The CCP wants to wait till its GDP surpasses that of the US, then Taiwan will voluntarily submit to Communist China. Now "Xi the Sun" has completely ruined the economy of mainland China, so the CCP has to go with its old plan, passing a legislation that will justify its invasion of Taiwan; the policy making of the US will always have the interest of financial groups in mind. When you see that almost all the financial groups are withdrawing investment from Communist China, then you know the CCP's days are numbered.

6/3/2022 文贵直播：中美必有一战！老共原打算等GDP超过美国后台湾自动回归，现在习太阳彻底搞垮了国内经济，只能按老路数，先立法，给打台湾制造合法性；美国制定政策必将考虑金融集团的利益，当你看到几乎所有的金融集团都从中共国撤资时，你就知道中共没几天活头了。
