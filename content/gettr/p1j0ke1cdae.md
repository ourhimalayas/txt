7/19/2022 Miles Guo: No matter whether the schedule changes, Nancy Pelosi is bound to visit Taiwan; Mr. Pompeo, a staunchly anti-communist, will run for U.S. president in 2024; the greatest asset of the NFSC citizens is that we didn't take COVID vaccines; Himalaya Dollar changed the fate of the whole family of our fellow fighter who fled the Communist China, and the happiness I felt from helping others cannot be described in words.

7/19/2022 文贵直播：无论行程是否有变，南希・佩洛西一定会去台湾；坚定反共的蓬佩奥先生将于2024年竞选美国总统；新中国联邦人最大的财富就是没打疫苗；喜美元改变了逃离中共国的战友一家人的命运，帮助别人让文贵感到无法形容的快乐。
