6/10/2022 Miles Guo: The political infightings of CCP have been intensifying before the 20th Party Congress. A certain Vice Premier of the CCP attempted to have someone contact me to win the New Federal State of China over to his side. At the celebration of the 2nd anniversary of the NFSC, I did not fear contracting the virus, being assassinated, or being framed by the CCP and chose to embrace our fellow fighters because of my strong faith and self-confidence, Next, the kleptocrats are likely to die one by one, and disasters may occur everywhere in Communist China. After that, everything will have to be restarted.

6/10/2022 文贵直播：20大之前中共内斗加剧，中共某副总理找人游说文贵企图拉拢新中国联邦；新中国联邦2周年庆典文贵无惧染上病毒、被中共暗杀或陷害的危险而与战友们拥抱，这是因为坚定的信仰和自信；接下来盗国贼们有可能排队死，大陆将灾难频发，百废待兴
