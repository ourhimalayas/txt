3/27/2023 There's no need to worry about Mr. Miles Guo's safety, and we must believe in the power of the righteous force! Many people in the detention facility know Mr. Guo and call him "General Fight"! Mr. Guo works out, studies English, and reads books every day. Everyone respects and takes care of him and has given him various daily necessities. Mr. Guo is a neat person and does cleaning seven times a day. No matter where he is, Mr. Guo always shows spirits of courage!
