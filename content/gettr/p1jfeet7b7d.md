7/22/2022 Miles Guo: Bruno Wu has paid the legal fees for Rui Ma's case and provided hundreds of thousands of dollars to Boxun to fund its intelligence operations in the US. Boxun colluded with Bruno Wu to extort tens of millions of dollars from me, and Bruno Wu is also a stakeholder of Paul Hastings. So, isn't there any conflict of interest? But Luc Despins shied away from this. There have never been any bankruptcy cases where the trustee and his/her law firm were considered separately by the court.

7/22/2022 文贵直播：吴征为马蕊案支付了律师费、在2012、13年给了博讯几十万美元以资助其在美情报工作，博讯曾跟吴征一道敲诈文贵几千万美元，吴征还是普衡的利益相关人，这难道没有利益冲突吗？卢克却对此避而不谈；从未见过有任何破产案的受托人及其律所被法庭分开考虑
