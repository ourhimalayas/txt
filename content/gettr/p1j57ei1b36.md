7/20/2022 Miles Guo: We got the U.S. intelligence official’s approval to make the CCP’s top classified military information public, which meanwhile was also conveyed to Taiwanese military officials. Such information would greatly reduce civilian casualties in case a war breaks out between the CCP and Taiwan. The same information was well known by Europe and Israel, but was accused of disinformation by the Taiwanese senior military officials.

7/20/2022 文贵直播：我们获得了美国情报部门的允许，公开了中共的机密军事情报，同时传递到台湾军方。该情报有助于在中共与台湾开战时，大幅减少双方平民伤亡。它同时被欧洲和以色列掌握，却被台湾军方高层污蔑为假信息。
