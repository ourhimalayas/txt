7/22/2022  Miles Guo: The lawyer representing us at yesterday's court hearing is a professional attorney with over 30 years experience, and he is the most qualified person who can determine whether or not there is a conflict of interest. Luc A. completely ignored the judge's questions regarding the conflict of interest concern, and a bunch of facts showing the existence of conflicts of interest were neglected at the hearing yesterday.
