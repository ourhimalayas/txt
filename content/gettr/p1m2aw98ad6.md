8/10/2022 Miles Guo: Zeng Qinghong still has tremendous control and influence in Communist China, and Xi Jinping is by no means a match for Zeng Qinghong. Jack Ma, Neil Shen, and Pony Ma are the core forces of the CCP's unrestricted warfare against the West. If Xi had listened to my revelations in 2017, he would not have been fooled and manipulated by the people around him. There are less than 100 people who really control Communist China! What does it mean to say "align with Zeng Qinghong in the long term, and befriend Xi Yuanping (Xi Jinping's brother) in the short term"?

8/10/2022 文贵直播：曾庆红在中共国仍有着巨大的控制力和影响力，习近平绝非曾庆红的对手；马云、沈南鹏和马化腾是中共对西方超限战的核心力量；假如习听了2017年文贵的爆料，他不至于被身边的人玩弄；不到100人真正控制着中共国！"远看曾庆红，近交习远平"意味着什么？
