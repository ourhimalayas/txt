5/6/2022 Miles Guo: For those who are capable and can survive abroad, I suggest that you leave Communist China. Even if you stay in the small neighboring countries, you will be better off than in Communist China. Everyone should make a long-term plan. When there is a food crisis in Communist China in the future, please stay away from the first-tier big cities, and the second and third-tier cities will be the safest. The CCP will definitely sacrifice the ordinary people in order to ensure that its members and their families have food.

5/6/2022 文贵直播：文贵建议国内的有本事而且能在国外生存的人一定要离开中共国，即便是待在周边小国也比在中共国强；大家都做好长远的打算，未来出现粮食危机的时候，请远离一线大城市，二三线城市最安全；中共为了保证党员及其家人有吃的，一定会牺牲普通老百姓
