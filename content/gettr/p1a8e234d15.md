5/15/2022 Miles Guo: Russia has been divided between several oligarchs. It's the people around Putin that turned him into a demon. Xi's anti-corruption campaign gave rise to the new oligarchs in Communist China, and Wang Qishan, who defends the interests of the Zhu Rongji and Jiang Zemin families, tried to take the opportunity to eliminate his enemies, including me. Wang Qishan whispered for 20 minutes to the person Li Keqiang trusts the most to ally with Li, but Wang has been taken out by the Whistleblowers' Movement. So, the Chinese Communist Party has become Xi's Communist Party!

5/15/2022 文贵直播：俄罗斯已被寡头们瓜分，普京身边的人把他变成了恶魔；习的反腐让中共国产生了新寡头，维护朱、江家族利益的王岐山试图借机消灭包括文贵在内的仇人；王岐山曾为与李克强联合而跟他最相信的人耳语20分钟；王岐山已被爆料革命干掉，共产党已沦为习产党
