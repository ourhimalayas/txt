8/1/2022 Miles Guo: Pelosi will fly from the US military base in Malaysia to Taiwan and will be awarded a medal by President Tsai Ing-wen. What do these two events mean? After Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, other political leaders of the US, Japan, and Europe will also want to visit Taiwan, won't they? There is nothing that the CCP can do about Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. But if the CCP starts to invade Taiwan, Beidaihe, where the CCP is having its conclave, will be the first target of the US. Even those CCP kleptocrats hidden underground will all be finished!

8/1/2022 文贵直播：佩洛西将从马来西亚的美军基地飞往台湾并接受蔡英文总统授勋，这两件事意味着啥？佩洛西访台后，美日欧的领导人难道不想去台湾？中共根本没有招来应对佩洛西访台，而一旦中共攻台，北戴河将是美国的第一个目标，躲在地底下的老杂毛们都会完蛋！
