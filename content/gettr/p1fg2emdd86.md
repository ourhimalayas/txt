Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan will not survive after the end of next year. 
On June 22, Mr. Miles Guo broke the news that everyone who attended the meeting believes that Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan will not live to see the end of next year. The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party(CCP) is a joke, not even talking about it. In 2017 Mr. Miles Guo told the world that Xi Jinping has health problems. In June, he reiterated again that Xi Jinping's health is one of the three major variables that will destroy the CCP. Who is unconvinced?
