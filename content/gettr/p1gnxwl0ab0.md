Early warning of the Double-headed Eagle Plan and Double Dragon Plan from Miles Guo in 2018 and 2019, respectively
On June 30, Miles Guo blew the whistle that, President Xi had arrived in HK to attend the Hong Kong(HK) ceremony on July 1. In September 2019, Miles revealed the Double Dragon plan of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that Xi would take HK and attack Taiwan(TW). The world denied and rejected the revelation. In April 2018, Miles pointed out the Sino-Russian Double-headed Eagle Plan, Xi would attack TW, and Putin would invade Ukraine. The latest NATO and the G7 summits have stated that the CCP is a threat, and realized that Xi wants to attack Taiwan. Both revelations have been fully verified.
