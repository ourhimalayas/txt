5/29/2022  Miles Guo: The fellow fighters living inside China should worry about whether or not they could survive instead of the pain after being poked in the throat. They should understand who force you to get poked, who let you live miserably, and who make you unable to afford to die. They must know the CCP is the root cause of all the sufferings they are experiencing. The only solution to all the problems is to take down the CCP.

5/29/2022 文贵直播：墙内战友不应担心嗓子被捅疼的问题，而应担心能否活下来的问题，应找到是谁让你的嗓子被捅，是谁让你活不好死不起，找到中共这个始作俑者来算总账。解决所有目前面临问题的唯一办法就是灭共。
