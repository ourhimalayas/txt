严格讲，南普陀计划它不可能就一个目标
Strictly speaking, the Nanputuo plan cannot have only one single goal

它当时把习作为一个就让你干5年就滚蛋吧，是吧，这是绝对的
it would allow Xi as the one for 5 years and then let hime get out, right? it’s absolute

然后呢培养第二个傻子过来，但是呢， 他第一段没成功
Then it would train a second fool to come over, but it didn’t succeed in the first part

习不走了，本来是在这儿当临时演员，不走了
Xi is not leaving, he was originally here as an background actor, but now he is not leaving

现在要当导演了，但是人家南普陀有多手计划，
Now he wants to be a director, but Nanputuo has many plans

如果习不听话咋办
What if Xi is not obedient?

那就让你折腾，利用你的手，利用你的疯狂，把党内的所有我的(政敌)
Then let him mess around, use Xi’s hands, use Xi’s madness, and kill all my political enemies in the party

第一那前五年，习百分之百被王岐山、孟建柱(控制)
In the first five years, Xi was 100% controlled by Wang Qishan and Meng Jianzhu

你想想孙力军都能干这样，就把一个完全的江家的对手全清光
you think about that Sun Lijun can do this, he completely cleared the opponents of the Jiang family

而且习深信不疑该清光，是吧
And Xi Jinping truly believes that it should be cleared up, right?

第二个五年让你修宪，你可以修宪
In the second five years, Xi asked for amendment to the constitution, you can amend the constitution

你不听了，是吧，然后让你跟世界走向疯狂
if you don’t obey, right? and then let you go crazy with the world

然后让你发出潘多拉盒子的病毒，让他放出病毒就决定了习的死亡
Then let Xi send out the virus of Pandora’s box, and letting him release the virus will determine Xi’s death

没有任何的，这个时候的共产党已经不是共产党了，是习党，是习共党
There is nothing, the Communist Party at this time is no longer the Communist Party, it is the Xi Party, it is the Xi Communist Party

但是回答你的问题，现在习所有的作出的决定和灭亡，就是习共党的灭亡
But to answer your question, all the decisions made by Xi now, and it’s the demise of the Xi-Communist Party

然后这家族是什么？江家从来没觉得共产党跟我毛关系
And what is this family? The Jiang family never felt that the Communist Party had anything to do with Jiang’s family

共产党就是我用的那个擀面杖子，习也一样，他们都比咱恨共产党
The Communist Party is the rolling pin Jiang use, and so does Xi, they all hate the Communist Party more than we do

但是他必须用共产党统治这些已经被洗了脑的中国14亿僵尸啊，这些奴隶呀
But he has to use the Communist Party to rule these brainwashed 1.4 billion Chinese zombies and slaves

最后就是江家找个名声，曾出手之日
in the end, the Jiang family find the reason, and Zeng make his move

王岐山和孟建柱和江家出手之日
When Wang Qishan, Meng Jianzhu and the Jiang family made their move one day

你会发现就像川普最后一个被内阁给策反一样
you will find that it was just like Trump was the last to be overthrew by the cabinet

你会发现突然间所有习最相信的人，都是他的敌人
You will find that suddenly all the people who Xi trusts most are all his enemies

杀手锏，啪，就完了，所以说，没什么党，这都是家族的
It is killing hand, it’s over quickly, so, there is no party, it’s all family’s

那个时候是江共党，现在是习共党
At that time it was the Jiang Communist Party, now it is the Xi Communist Party

现在的决定，既不是党的决定, 就是习共党的决定
and the current decision is neither the party’s decision or It was the decision of the Communist Party of Xi

那时候是江共党的决定，就这么简单
at that time, it was the decision of the Communist Party of Jiang, it’s simple like this

咱们老百姓就是奴隶
We Laobaixing are slaves
