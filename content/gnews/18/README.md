The U.S. National Endowment for Democracy Visits Taiwan

On March 28, Taiwan time, the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy (NED), led by President Damon Wilson, visited Taiwan for three days. During the visit, the delegate will meet with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌), and Legislative Speaker You Si-Kun (游錫堃), attending a banquet hosted by Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it’s Wilson’s first time visiting Asia since he took office last July. It demonstrates the importance of Wilson’s attachment to Taiwan that he selected Taiwan as the first stop on his first trip to Asia. Wilson tweeted that Taiwan is becoming a center for defending the democratic way of life, and he is honored to visit one of the freest societies in the world.

Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded in a press release, thanking the NED for its long-term attention to Taiwan’s democratic development. With the NED’s encouragement, Taiwan established the “Taiwan Democracy Foundation” in 2003, which worked closely with the NED to promote democracy and human rights in the Indo-Pacific region.

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in cooperation with the groups like the Taiwan Democracy Foundation, NED President Wilson will announce at a press conference that the “World Movement for Democracy” will be held in Taipei for the first time from October 24 to 27 to affirm Taiwan’s democratic achievements.

The U.S. “German Marshall Fund” Reports that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Maliciously Isolates Taiwan

The report mentioned that the CCP distorted Resolution 2758 passed by the United Nations in 1971 into “the one-China principle and Taiwan is a province of the People’s Republic of China” and used this to isolate Taiwan and prevent Taiwan from participating in UN affairs. In addition, in response to the viewpoints of Taiwan’s Foreign Minister when connecting with foreign media, the report emphasized that Taiwan plays a crucial role in global technology supply. The report recommends that the United States develop a more effective strategy to counter China’s attempts to distort UN Resolution 2758.
