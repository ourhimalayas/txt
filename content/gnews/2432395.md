以下为引用视频的全英文纪要：

**Elizabeth:** Now I do want to move on, we sort of mentioned the book a little bit but I want to move on to more the overall concept of all these child vaccines, there are some serious issues and on the safety side and the way that they've been studied. So, and that's what you and Robert Kennedy and you already mentioned it but from 2019 I get the impression that you've been combing through all the studies in PubMed looking for research that compared health outcomes in VAX population versus unvax populations.

So and there's a good reason for that and do you want to. I think one of the things that disturbs me is the number of shots our children are getting now compared to how many they used to get and you've actually talked about this in the book, if you look at the 1960s and the 1980s and then 2003 we have the stark contrast and the number of shots the kids are getting, but nobody has done a study to look at kids that get no shots and grow up compared to kids that get these 70 something shots now in the US and grow up.

And what is their health look like at the end, you know, compare this 50-year-old with that 50-year-old, it's a big thing, that's a big flaw that VAX UNVAX studies not done. Was that like the main thing that you were looking for? But tell us what you were looking for when you were going through the papers.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Well, we started looking at comparisons of the entire vaccination schedule versus those children and adults that had never been vaccinated at all, and so that's what we focused on especially in chapter 2 of the book where we call these true comparisons of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children, and so we highlighted about nine studies that have been done by independent researchers, independent scientists, where the unvaccinated were actually a part of the study.

 And we saw that unvaccinated children had less ear infections, less asthma, less allergies, less developmental delays, less autism, less ADD ADHD, less gastrointestinal issues, you know, and the list went on and on and on, you know respiratory diseases, other infectious diseases, ear infections, neurological diseases, and autoimmune diseases just jumped off the page as being much much more prevalent in those children who are following the CDC's vaccination schedule, which you know, this year takes the cake. It went from 73 to 103, 103 shots before age 18, incredible you know and they added 30 shots just by adding the Covid 19 vaccine, and then they started recommending that children under 9 years of age get two flu shots a year, not just one. So, and then we, I'm sorry, go ahead, Elizabeth.

**Elizabeth:** I was just gonna say I mean some things, you know Brian, is like really the children can beat the flu, they beat it easily, you know it's not worth the risk of an injection and really children also be covered easily now. So it's really disappointing anyway, so just so you know for comparison to in Australia they don't have as many as Americans do, Americans do seem to really be far worse, the schedule is far more aggressive. But like yours out has increased since the 60s with every year it gets worse.

Yeah, well the number of shots increases. I shouldn't say gets worse, the number of shots increases. So sorry, continues.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** And these are big business, you know if you get a vaccine on the schedule, you know if when the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices votes and votes to include a new vaccine on the CDC schedule, that business, the company that manufactures that vaccine, is guaranteed $1 billion a year in sales for as long as that vaccine is on the schedule or more or more, you know, you look at the Covid shots they made, you know, within a year and a half the Pfizer made $56 billion, Moderna made $32 billion dollars, you know, and people on Pfizer's boards became billionaires because of the vaccine.

And so this is really, really big business that are driving these huge numbers of vaccines and they have nothing to do with child health otherwise then the CDC would be testing these vaccines together and they would also be looking at the unvaccinated control group rather than disparaging the unvaccinated control group as somehow as odd or you know fringe element or whatever, you know when you don't vaccinate your child, you know regardless of whether they were earlier vaccine injured or not, you know by reasons why you stop vaccinating you get marginalized quite a bit.

**Elizabeth:** Yeah. You know that it's nine independent studies you mentioned, you went through a whole list of ailments that are more prevalent in the vaccinated children the unvaccinated children, which what statistic really stood out if we were gonna pick out one and I don't know whether you can show the graph, I mean I can possibly show it from the book, but what statistic really I mean obviously though the autism statistic stands out.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Well, we did a study. I actually, one of the studies that I featured in the book was a study that I published with a medical journalist, his name is Neil Miller, and we did a study of fully vaccinated kids, kids who were up to date on their vaccines versus fully unvaccinated kids, and the rates of ADD ADHD were 27 times, that's 2,700% higher, in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group, the rate of ear infections were 30 times higher, 30 times the incidence of ear infections in the vaccinated group.

And I knew that for the time that my son was vaccinated, he was a walking ear infection, it seemed like he just consistently was on an antibiotic, and the thing that really got me was the relative health of the unvaccinated cohort of the unvaccinated group, they were not getting infectious respiratory diseases, they were not getting pneumonia.

And you know, that's why I tell people, if you want to look at the real meat and potatoes of this book, start in the second chapter, because that is the comparison of vaccinated children versus fully unvaccinated children. So, that's really what jumped out were those results for ADD, ADHD, as well as ear infections.

The other thing that I saw consistently was that the rates of autism were five times higher among the vaccinated, regardless of what study you looked at. It was anywhere between four times and five times higher, so it seemed to be a very, very consistent number. Anthony Mawson had a research group; he's from Jackson State University in Mississippi in the United States. I found that same result with Neil Miller, and then James Lyons-Weiler found that same result working with Paul Thomas.

And we would consistently, across the board, always see that there were five times as many autism cases in the vaccinated group versus the unvaccinated. Are there autistic children who are unvaccinated? Yes, there are. But we did consistently see five times higher, which is substantial, and it always was statistically significant.

**Elizabeth:** Yeah, that's incredible. That Miller-Hooker study, your study together, how many, do you remember off the top of your head, how many unvaccinated children were in the group?

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Well, there were two studies that are featured in the book, one that was published in 2020 and one that was published in 2021. And in the first group, the first study, we had about 600 unvaccinated children, and in the second study, we had about 900 unvaccinated children.

So, you know, these pockets of children do exist, and these were all based on medical records. They weren't, you know, survey instruments that parents were filling out. These were actual electronic medical records that we received from practitioners, and we picked through that. They were de-identified.

So we didn't know the patient's names but we were approached by practitioners, pediatricians who are friendly to the health freedom movement. So we expected to see, you know, a substantial number of unvaccinated children who do exist.

**Elizabeth:** Yeah. Okay, and then you just compare to other children sort of at the same born at the same time you try and match them up.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Match them up at the same time. Practices had a mix of all three types fully vaccinated, unvaccinated, and partially vaccinated, so we had three different groups that we looked at, and so they were all coming from the same medical practices, having the same doctors doing the diagnoses, which we felt like was important.

We didn't want things to be too scattered among, you know, many many disparate medical practices because, you know, you also have different doctors diagnosing, and so we wanted to keep it, you know, more of a tight cohort as we say, and, you know, they're published, they're peer-reviewed, they've stood the test of time. The one that was published in 2020 has been downloaded, I think over 250,000 times.

**Elizabeth:** This is your, this is your Miller-Hooker.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Yes, that's right.

**Elizabeth:** These aren't retracted, these ones they're up still.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** No, they are out there absolutely.

**Elizabeth:** Yeah, well I'll definitely put a link to that one, so that's okay, so that's the standout.

以下为引用视频的中文大意：

**Elizabeth:** 现在我想转移话题，我们稍微提到了这本书，但我想谈谈所有这些儿童[[zh:疫苗]]的整体概念，存在一些严重问题，[[zh:关于]]安全性以及它们被研究的方式。所以，你和罗伯特·[[zh:肯尼迪]]已经提到了，但从2019年开始，我觉得你一直在翻阅PubMed上的所有研究，寻找比较接种人群与未接种人群的健康结果的研究。

所以这有一个很好的理由，你想要。我认为让我不安的一件事是我们的孩子现在接种的[[zh:疫苗]]剂量与他们过去接种的剂量相比是如此之多，你在书中也谈到了这一点，如果你看看1960年代和1980年代以及2003年的对比，我们可以看到儿童[[zh:接种疫苗]]数量的明显差异，但没有人进行研究比较完全不[[zh:接种疫苗]]长大的孩子和[[zh:美国]]现在接种这70多种[[zh:疫苗]]的孩子，他们长大后的健康状况如何。

你知道，比较这个50岁的人和那个50岁的人，这是一个很大的问题，这是接种与未[[zh:接种疫苗]]研究没有做的一个很大的缺陷。这是否是你寻找的主要内容？但告诉我们你在查阅论文时寻找的是什么。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 嗯，我们开始着手比较整个[[zh:疫苗]]接种计划与那些从未接种过[[zh:疫苗]]的儿童和成人，所以这是我们专注的重点，特别是在书的第二章中，我们称这些为真正的接种与未接种儿童的比较研究，所以我们重点介绍了大约九项由独立研究人员、独立[[zh:科学家]]进行的研究，其中未接种者实际上是研究的一部分。

我们发现未接种的儿童患耳部感染、哮喘、过敏、发育迟缓、自闭症、注意力缺陷多动障碍、胃肠问题等疾病较少，你知道，这个清单不胜枚举，有呼吸道疾病、其他传染性疾病、耳部感染、神经系统疾病，而自身免疫性疾病刚刚跳出页面，这些问题在那些按照[[zh:疾控中心]]的接种时间表[[zh:接种疫苗]]的儿童中更为突出，今年的接种量更是创纪录。在18岁之前，接种次数从73次增加到103次，令人难以置信，他们通过加入[[zh:新冠]][[zh:疫苗]]增加了30次接种，然后开始建议9岁以下的儿童每年接种两剂流感[[zh:疫苗]]，而不仅仅是一剂。所以，我们，[[zh:对不起]]，伊丽莎白，你说吧。

**Elizabeth:** 我刚想说的是，我是说有些事情，你知道，布莱恩，孩子们可以轻松地战胜它，你知道这并不值得冒接种的风险，而且现在孩子们也可以很容易地得到保护。所以无论如何这真的让人失望，所以只是为了和[[zh:澳大利亚]]作比较，他们没有像[[zh:美国]]人那样多，[[zh:美国]]人似乎真的糟糕得多，接种时间表更为激进。但是像你所说的，从60年代开始每年都在增加。是的，接种次数增加了。我不应该说变得更糟，而应该说接种次数增加了。所以抱歉，继续说。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 这些都是大生意，你知道如果你按照时间表[[zh:接种疫苗]]，你知道当免疫接种咨询实践委员会投票并投票决定在[[zh:疾控中心]]的接种时间表上包括一种新[[zh:疫苗]]时，那个业务，制造那种[[zh:疫苗]]的[[zh:公司]]，将确保每年有10亿[[zh:美元]]的销售额，只要那种[[zh:疫苗]]在时间表上或更长时间，或更多，你知道看看[[zh:新冠]][[zh:疫苗]]他们赚了多少，在一年半的时间里，[[zh:辉瑞公司]]赚了560亿[[zh:美元]]，[[zh:莫德纳]]赚了320亿[[zh:美元]]，你知道，[[zh:辉瑞]]的[[zh:董事会]]成员因为[[zh:疫苗]]而成为亿万富翁。

所以这确实是一个非常大的生意，这些大量的[[zh:疫苗]]与儿童健康无关，否则[[zh:疾控中心]]会一起测试这些[[zh:疫苗]]，并且他们也会看着未接种的对照组，而不是贬低未接种的对照组，将其视为奇怪的或边缘的元素，或者其他什么，你知道当你不给孩子[[zh:接种疫苗]]时，你会被边缘化，而无论早期[[zh:接种疫苗]]时是否受伤，你知道你停止[[zh:接种疫苗]]的原因，你会被边缘化很多。

**Elizabeth:** 是的。你知道你提到了九项独立研究，你列举了一整套在接种儿童中更常见的疾病，相比未接种儿童更常见的疾病，如果我们要挑选出一个统计数据，哪个数据真的非常突出呢？我不知道你是否可以展示图表，我可能可以从书中展示，但显然自闭症的统计数据最为突出。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 嗯，我们进行了一项研究。实际上，我在书中介绍的一项研究是我与一位医学记者尼尔·米勒合作完成的，我们对接种完全符合要求的儿童与完全未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的儿童进行了研究，结果发现，[[zh:接种疫苗]]的群体中，注意力缺陷多动障碍的发病率是未接种群体的27倍，即高出2700%；而耳部感染的发病率则是接种群体的30倍，接种群体耳部感染的发病率是未接种群体的30倍。

我知道，在我儿子[[zh:接种疫苗]]的期间，他几乎一直都在遭受耳部感染的困扰，似乎他不断需要服用抗生素。而让我真正震惊的是未接种群体的相对健康状况，未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的群体，他们没有患传染性呼吸道疾病，也没有患肺炎。

你知道的，所以我告诉人们，如果你想了解这本书真正的重点，可以从第二章开始看起，因为那里介绍了接种儿童与完全未接种儿童的比较。所以，真正引人注目的是那些[[zh:关于]]注意力缺陷多动障碍和耳部感染的结果。

另一个我一直观察到的情况是，不管你看哪项研究，接种群体的自闭症发病率都比未接种群体高出五倍。不管怎样，这个倍数都介于四倍和五倍以下，所以这个数字似乎是非常、非常一致的。安东尼·莫森（Anthony Mawson）有一个研究团队，他来自[[zh:美国]][[zh:密西西比]]州的杰克逊州立大学。我和尼尔·米勒也得出了同样的结果，而詹姆斯·[[zh:里昂]]斯\-韦勒（James Lyons-Weiler）在与保罗·托马斯（Paul Thomas）合作时也得出了同样的结果。

我们一直能够始终如一地看到接种群体中自闭症病例是未接种群体的五倍。未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的孩子中有患自闭症的吗？是的，有。但是，你知道，我们确实一直看到自闭症发病率是五倍高，这是相当大的差距，并且这种差距在统计上总是显著的。

**Elizabeth:** 是的，这真是令人难以置信。米勒\-胡克的研究，你们的研究结果是一起的，你还记得头脑中有多少未接种的孩子？

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 嗯，书中介绍了两项研究，一项于2020年发表，另一项于2021年发表。在第一项研究中的第一组，我们有大约600名未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的儿童，而在第二项研究中，我们有大约900名未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的儿童。

所以，你知道，这些未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的孩子群体确实存在，而且这些数据都是基于医疗记录的。它们不是由家长填写的调查问卷，而是我们从医务人员那里获得的实际电子医疗记录，我们对此进行了分析。这些记录是去标识化的，所以我们不知道患者的姓名，但我们是通过对健康自由运动友好的儿科医生的联系而得到这些记录的。因此，我们确实看到存在这样一群未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的孩子。

**Elizabeth:** 是的。好的，然后你只是将他们与同一时间出生的其他孩子进行比较，试图将他们匹配起来。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 确实，将他们匹配到同一时间。医疗机构中有三种类型的孩子，完全[[zh:接种疫苗]]的、未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的和部分[[zh:接种疫苗]]的，所以我们观察了三种不同的群体，它们都来自同一家医疗机构，接受同一家医院的诊断，我们认为这很重要。

我们不希望事情分散在许多不同的医疗机构中，因为你也会有不同的医生进行诊断，所以我们希望保持更加紧密的队列，我们说得更紧密一些，你知道的，它们已经发表了，经过同行评审，经受了时间的考验。2020年发表的那篇文章已经被下载了，我想超过25万次了。

**Elizabeth:** 这是你的，这是你和米勒一起做的。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 是的，没错。

**Elizabeth:** 这些没有被撤回，它们还在。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 是的，它们确实存在。

**Elizabeth:** 是的，好的，我肯定会给那篇文章放个链接，那么这就是突出的地方。
