以下为引用视频的全英文纪要：

**Greg Bouden:** And now, Dr. McCullough and I, we've talked before that no one's really researching, well, the mRNA. There's plenty of people that just immediately say it's Covid-19, and that's the first conversation when you're hearing this, Dr. McCollough, you've certainly been testifying and going in front of many, have you heard a story like this before?

**Dr. McCullough:** Yeah, I have. And, you know, one of the things I do, Greg, is I'm meticulous in citing the literature so people can actually locate this. So for this show, I want to cite a paper published by Bahram Rabani, and this was published in the journal Neurology, which is a very good journal. The title of the paper is "A case of transverse myelitis after Moderna Sars CoV-2 vaccination," and this occurred in a man. He was 60 years old.

And this was, he had progressed, he actually was admitted to the hospital, and Kayla, believe it or not, they originally thought it was a stroke, originally. But he had this bilateral numbness, he quickly went flaccid, and it was at the T9 dermatome level, and then he went into, he underwent an MRI. And what they describe, Kayla, is very important. They describe a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, and that's exactly what you've described.

So, you know, the important point is the vaccines were never tested for safety. So they only had in the clinical trials, they had one month where the primary series was given, and then two months of observation. We never knew what would happen after a booster, no one knew, and sure enough, you developed this extensive case of transverse myelitis.

So I know the listeners are very engaged now, tell us what happened next.

**Kayla Pollock:** Well, I did remember that the AstraZeneca trials had been stopped for a case of transverse myelitis, so at this point in time my boyfriend had arrived at the emergency room, they finally let him in. There was a lot of security issues, I wasn't able to have someone come in, but because now they found out that I was actually paralyzed, I wasn't just a psych patient, they basically had to let him in because they didn't have the staff to turn me or to do anything, so they figured well, he could do all the dirty work for them, which is essentially why they let him in, right?

He's an essential caregiver now at this point, right? So, and besides, they needed someone to feed me if I, if I ever got to that point. I mean, of course, I'm on an IV at this point, but I mean, remember I'm paralyzed from the neck down, so it's no longer in my head. The site consult was canceled, nobody ever apologized for that, they never will, that's just how you're treated.

And basically, I told him that we need to start recording everything, that I knew that legally that I needed to record it, so I asked him to push my finger on the record button so that I was the party recording, I was the party having the conversations, so I am legally able to record these conversations. So I did that and twice I was told by two different people on audio that this was caused by the Moderna shot, which was also in my medical records.

**Greg Bouden:** Kayla, if you don't mind, I'd like to play that audio for people, just because I want them to hear it.

**Kayla Pollock:** That audio just says, that audio actually just says, 'possibly cause-wise.' That particular, well, you can play it, of course.

**Greg Bouden:** All right, just so I want people just to understand that this recording is out there, doctors are starting to talk that they've seen this before, and I think this is in context here, here it is, and make sure I have audio coming through.

**Greg Bouden:** And then your medical reports mentioned transverse myelitis two of the reports and they're seen here in this, this from the Canadian depend, I want to give them credit, and so multiple accounts there from doctors and I just think that's important. I tell you that, Kayla, because Dr. McCulloch knows this as well. I often have content taken down by YouTube because they don't see the research or they're saying that's a false accusation. I wanted to make sure that we backed up, the doctors did document this in your chart. So thank you for letting me do that.

**Kayla Pollock:** Yeah, I made sure that I came forward with all my medical records and that I came forward with those audio recordings because I thought it was important when I told my story that I back it up because I knew there was going to be people that say it's not caused by the vaccine, has nothing to do with that, people are blaming their lives on it. A lot of people say you chose to take the vaccine, a lot of people say you are suing Moderna and you can't do that because they have immunity. I'm in Canada, they do not have legislative immunity.

They say that you're just looking for the money and I tell them how much money would you take to sit in my chair because there's no amount of money you could pay me to sit in my chair. I've lost all control of my bowels of my bladder. I'm attached to a catheter at all times, I have no use in my legs, I can feel everything, so it's very painful, burning, neuropathy. I have no feeling in my hands and there's a lot of injuries occurred by that on top of being type 1 diabetic that creates a hellfire storm when you think of bedsores and diabetics with open wounds.

I get pressure sores on my feet from sitting on my wheelchair, it is absolute pain and health, and it is horrible, and I came forward with my story because a year ago I just sort of looked up one day and thought why did this happen to me and I immediately thought you know why this happened to you because you know that you have a voice and that you're not afraid to talk in front of large audiences of people. I used to train exotic animals for a living, lions, monkeys, parrots, I was on stage with dog whipos for Caesar Milan in front of 19,000 people at the Air Canada Center, talking about service dog etiquette.

So when he handed me the microphone, I was on stage, willing to do that. And you know, I've always sort of been a person with vision, and I knew that if I told my story, it would go worldwide. So I had my 9-year-old son say to me one day, "Mom, I think that you need to tell people about what happened to you because," he said, "what if there's somebody that's just like you and you know they're afraid to talk to people and maybe they don't even want to live with themselves anymore, and there's maybe other quadriplegics that you could help, and you could help people if you talked about your story."

And you know what, I knew a year ago that I should come forward, and when a nine-year-old tells you to do it and he's your son and he says it so innocently, you know I set my family down and I said, "This will go around the world, this could mean that mommy's gonna be traveling, this could mean a lot of things, this is very political, and this will change our lives, and it might not all be good, this does not mean that it's going to be a walk in the park, there are going to be people that say very bad things about this, and this is gonna change our lives, and like I said it's not gonna all be good, and it hasn't, and it hasn't been easy."

以下为引用视频的中文大意：

**Greg Bouden:** 现在，[[zh:麦卡洛]]医生和我之前曾经讨论过，没有人真正在研究mRNA。有很多人立刻就说这是Covid-19，这是当你听到这个消息时的第一次谈话，麦科洛医生，你肯定已经作证并在许多场合前出现过，你以前听过这样的故事吗？

**Dr. McCullough:** 是的，我听过。你知道，我做的一件事，格雷格，就是在引用文献方面非常细致，以便人们实际上可以找到它。所以在这个节目中，我想引用巴拉姆·拉巴尼发表的一篇论文，这篇论文发表在《神经病学》杂志上，这是一本非常好的杂志。这篇论文的标题是《Moderna Sars CoV-2[[zh:疫苗]]后的横贯性[[zh:脊髓]]炎病例》，而这发生在一个男人身上，他今年60岁。

事实上，他进了医院，凯拉，信不信由你，他们最初以为他是[[zh:中风]]。但他双侧感觉麻木，很快就变得无力，位于T9神经节水平，然后他进行了核磁共振。他们描述的，凯拉，非常重要。他们描述了一个纵向广泛的横贯性[[zh:脊髓]]炎，这正是你所描述的。

所以，你知道，重要的一点是，这些[[zh:疫苗]]从来没有经过安全性测试。因此，在临床试验中，他们只进行了一个月的原始接种，并观察了两个月。我们从来不知道加强剂之后会发生什么，没有人知道，而你确实患上了这种严重的横贯性[[zh:脊髓]]炎。

所以我知道听众现在非常投入，请告诉我们接下来发生了什么。

**Kayla Pollock:** 嗯，我记得[[zh:阿斯利康]]的试验因为横贯性[[zh:脊髓]]炎而停止，所以这时候我男朋友已经到了急诊室，他们终于让他进来了。有很多安全问题，我不能让别人进来，但因为他们现在发现我实际上是瘫痪了，我不再是一个精神病患者，他们基本上不得不让他进来，因为他们没有工作人员来为我翻身或做任何事情，所以他们认为他可以替他们做所有的脏活累活，这基本上是为什么他们让他进来的，对吧？

在这个阶段，他现在是一个重要的护理者，对吧？此外，如果我有一天需要，他们需要有人喂我。我的意思是，当然，此时我正在输液，但是请记住，我从颈部以下都瘫痪了，所以这不再是我的头脑里的事情。会诊被取消了，没有人道歉，他们永远不会道歉，这就是你受到的对待。

基本上，我告诉他，我们需要开始记录一切，我知道从法律上来说，我需要记录下来，所以我要求他按下录音按钮，这样我就是记录方，我是进行对话的一方，所以我在法律上有权记录这些对话。所以我做到了，两次我听到两个不同的人在录音中告诉我，这是由[[zh:莫德纳]][[zh:疫苗]]引起的，这也记录在我的病历中。

**Greg Bouden:** 凯拉，如果你不介意的话，我想播放那段录音给大家听，只是因为我希望他们能听到。

**Kayla Pollock:** 那段录音实际上只是说，那段录音实际上只是说，“可能是原因。” 那个特别的，嗯，你当然可以播放。

**Greg Bouden:** 好的，我只是想让人们明白这段录音是存在的，医生们开始讨论他们以前见过这种情况，我认为这是在这个情境下的，就是这样，这里有它，确保我有声音传过来。

**Greg Bouden:** 然后你的医疗报告提到了横贯性[[zh:脊髓]]炎，其中两份报告，这些都在这里，这是[[zh:加拿大]]文献，我想要给他们以赞扬，所以医生们有多个记录，我认为这很重要。我告诉你这个，凯拉，因为[[zh:麦卡洛]]医生也知道。我的发布经常被油管删除，因为他们没有看到研究或者他们说那是虚假指控，我想确保我们备份了医生在你的病历中记录的这一点。所以谢谢你让我这样做。

**Kayla Pollock:** 是的，我确保我提供了所有我的医疗记录，并提供了这些音频录音，因为我认为当我讲述我的故事时，将其支持是很重要的，因为我知道会有人说这不是[[zh:疫苗]]引起的，与此无关，人们都在把生命归咎于这个。很多人说你选择[[zh:接种疫苗]]，很多人说你在起诉[[zh:莫德纳]]，你不能这样做，因为他们有豁免权。我在[[zh:加拿大]]，他们没有法定豁免权。

他们说你只是为了钱而这样做，我告诉他们你要多少钱才能坐在我的椅子上，因为没有任何金额的钱可以让我坐在我的椅子上。我的肠道和膀胱完全失控。我一直连接着导尿管，我的腿没有用了，我什么感觉都有，所以非常疼，烧灼感，神经病变。我的手感觉不到任何东西，这给我带来了很多伤害，再加上我是1型[[zh:糖尿病]]患者，这在想到[[zh:糖尿病]]患者有开放性伤口的褥疮时就像是一场地狱般的风暴。

我因为坐轮椅而在脚上长了压疮，这是绝对的痛苦和健康问题，非常可怕。我能够站出来讲述我的故事是因为一年前的某一天，我突然抬头想，为什么我身上会发生这种事情，我立刻意识到，你知道这是为什么发生在你身上的，因为你知道自己有[[zh:话语权]]，而且你不害怕在大量观众面前讲话。我过去以训练异国动物为生，[[zh:狮子]]、猴子、鹦鹉，我曾在[[zh:加拿大]]航空中心带着狗鞭子与凯撒·[[zh:米兰]]一起站在舞台上，面对着1万9千人的观众，讲述[[zh:关于]]服务犬礼仪的话题。

所以当他把麦克风递给我时，我就站在舞台上，愿意这样做。你知道，我一直是一个有远见的人，我知道如果我讲述我的故事，它会传播到全世界。所以有一天，我的9岁儿子对我说，“妈妈，我认为你需要告诉别人你发生了什么事，因为”，他说，“如果有人和你一样，你知道他们害怕和别人说话，也许他们甚至不想再活下去了，而且可能还有其他的四肢瘫痪患者，你可以帮助他们，如果你讲述你的故事的话。”

你知道吗，一年前我就知道我应该挺身而出，当一个九岁的孩子告诉你要这么做，他是你的儿子，他说得那么天真，你就知道我让家人坐下来，我说，“这将在全球传播，这可能意味着妈妈要旅行，这可能意味着很多事情，这是非常[[zh:政治]]化的，这将改变我们的生活，而且可能不全是好事，这并不意味着事情会一帆风顺，会有人恶语相加，这将改变我们的生活，就像我说的，不会全都是好事，这并不容易。”
