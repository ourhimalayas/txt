**Marjorie Taylor Greene:** How many of your patients or pregnant women that you know of, experienced miscarriages after taking the COVID-19 vaccines or injection?

**Dr. Kimberly Biss:** Yeah, so a lot of that was hard to... I will tell you that I looked at my pregnancy population in the fall of last year—everybody that was pregnant in our practice. And our vaccination rate in that patient population was about 60%. That's pretty common, measured with Florida because, last I checked, in the CDC site, the vaccination rate in Florida overall was about 65 to 70%. Most of our pregnant patients received three injections; very few received four or more. And what's concerning is the majority of the patients received their injections in 2021 and early 2022. However, we're still seeing lingering effects. I have a great substack that Jessica Rose published in November of 2022, which shows my data in pictorial form. That's pretty right there behind you. So, I went back to January of 2020, and this data went up to the beginning of November of 2022. I will tell you, in 2020, we had very many newly registered obstetric patients, which is what the blue bars represent. Those are first-trimester newly pregnant patients. We had the most deliveries we've had, and probably, wink-wink, that was due to the lockdowns. we did also have what was considered the normal pregnancy loss rate. Now, what's quoted in my obstetric textbook and in some articles is that a normal miscarriage rate is 13 to 15%. I've never seen that clinically. There was a study that came out in 2020 by a gentleman named Naert-NAERT et al. that showed the actual miscarriage rate in the first trimester is 5 to 6%, and even that's a little high from what I've seen. My average miscarriage rate in 2020, month-to-month, was 4%. That was normal. I had done a video where I wrongly said, that my miscarriage rate had increased by 50% because I was put on the spot; I didn't have my data in front of me. I was wrong. My miscarriage rate from year to year went up 100% in 2021. The average miscarriage rate month-to-month was 7 to 8%. We peaked in November of that year for some reason. That's actually when a non-clinical staff member came up to me and said, "Dr. Biss, do you realize we've had eight miscarriages this month?" Which, in a practice that delivers 20 to 25 patients, that's a huge number. In 2022, the average month-to-month rate was 15%. Now, that was up till November. I will tell you, in December, I've never seen this before. We had 41 newly registered patients; 13 of them lost their babies, so that's 25% right there. And then, in January and February of 2023, it still remained high, didn't normalize until June of this year, then went up a little bit and came down in September. So, we're still seeing effects. You asked how many patients had the vaccine and then lost their babies. That's hard to determine. I mean, I can tell you 60% of my patients got vaccinated, but the problem is, if they're brand new to the practice, I haven't seen them yet because I'm the only person in my practice that asks every patient, "Have you gotten a vaccine? How many? Which brand? When? Have you had COVID? How many times?" Because, whether we like it or not, that's part of your medical history now, I'm the only one that asks those questions. So, the problem is, if a woman miscarries and you ask them, "Well, did you get an injection?" You may come across as accusatory to that person. So, that's information you don't ever want to make a woman feel like she caused her baby to not be born. So, it's hard to get the exact data in all those patients.

**Marjorie Taylor Greene:** Of course, do you find a correlation, with miscarriages and certain vaccines? Certain vaccines, whether it's Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson?

**Dr. Kimberly Biss:** Yeah, that's a good question. I mean, the majority of our patients got Pfizer. the majority was Pfizer. I don't have that breakdown as far as the percentage.

**Marjorie Taylor Greene:** Okay, thank you.

**马乔利·泰勒·格林：**您知道的您的患者中有多少是怀孕妇女，在接种[[zh:新冠]][[zh:疫苗]]或注射后经历了[[zh:流产]]？

**金伯利·比斯博士：**是的，这方面的很多情况都很难……我可以告诉您，去年秋天我看了我们诊所里所有怀孕的人。我们的接种率在那些患者中大约为60%。这在[[zh:佛罗里达州]]相当普遍，因为据我上次查看[[zh:疾控中心]]网站的数据，[[zh:佛罗里达州]]的总接种率约为65%至70%。我们大多数怀孕的患者接种了三剂[[zh:疫苗]]；很少有人接种了四剂或更多。令人担忧的是，大多数患者在2021年和2022年初接种了[[zh:疫苗]]。但是，我们仍然看到了持续的影响。我有一份2022年[[zh:11月]]由[[zh:杰西卡·罗斯]]发布的精彩文集，显示了我的数据的图表形式，就在您身后。所以，我回溯到了2020年[[zh:1月]]，数据一直到了2022年[[zh:11月]]初。我告诉您，2020年我们有很多新注册的产科患者，蓝色柱代表了第一孕三个月怀孕的新患者。我们接受了最多的分娩，并且可能，嘘嘘，这可能是由于封锁政策。我们也有被认为是正常的[[zh:流产]]率。现在，我的产科教科书和一些文章中所引用的正常[[zh:流产]]率是13%到15%。我在临床上从未看到过这种情况。2020年出版了一项研究，由一个叫纳纳特（Naert）的先生等人完成，显示了第一孕三个月的实际[[zh:流产]]率为5%到6%，即使这也有点高于我的观察。我2020年月度平均[[zh:流产]]率为4%，这是正常的。我曾做过一个视频，错误地说我的[[zh:流产]]率增加了50%，因为我当时突然被问到，我手头没有数据。我错了，我的[[zh:流产]]率从一年到另一年上升了100%。2021年，每个月的平均[[zh:流产]]率为7%到8%。由于某种原因，那一年的[[zh:11月]]达到了[[zh:高峰]]，这实际上是一个非临床工作人员在那时走过来对我说：“比斯医生，您意识到我们这个月[[zh:流产]]了八个孩子吗？”在一个每月接生20至25名患者的诊所，这是一个巨大的数字。2022年，月度平均率为15%。那是截止到[[zh:11月]]份。我告诉您，[[zh:12月]]份，我从未见过这种情况。我们有41名新注册患者；其中有13人[[zh:流产]]了，占25%。然后，在2023年的[[zh:1月]]和[[zh:2月]]，情况仍然很严重，直到今年[[zh:6月]]才恢复正常，然后在[[zh:9月]]回升了一点。所以，我们仍然看到影响。您问有多少患者[[zh:接种疫苗]]后[[zh:流产]]。这很难确定。我可以告诉您，我的患者中有60%接种了[[zh:疫苗]]，但问题是，如果他们是诊所的新患者，我还没有见过他们，因为在我的诊所中，只有我一个人会问每个患者：“您接种了[[zh:疫苗]]吗？多少剂？哪种品牌？什么时候接种的？您感染过[[zh:新冠]]吗？感染了多少次？”因为不管我们是否喜欢，这现在已成为您的医疗史的一部分，我是唯一一个会问这些问题的人。所以问题是，如果一个女性[[zh:流产]]了，然后你问她：“嗯，你接种了[[zh:疫苗]]吗？”那可能会让她感到被指责。所以，您永远不希望让一个女性觉得她导致了她的宝宝没有出生。所以，在所有这些患者中获得确切数据是很困难的。

**马乔利·泰勒·格林：**当然，您是否发现[[zh:流产]]与某些[[zh:疫苗]]之间存在相关性？无论是[[zh:辉瑞]]、[[zh:莫德纳]]还是[[zh:强生疫苗]]？

**金伯利·比斯博士：**是的，这是一个很好的问题。我是说，我们大多数患者接种的是[[zh:辉瑞]][[zh:疫苗]]。绝大多数是[[zh:辉瑞]]。至于具体的百分比，我没有这样的细分。

**马乔利·泰勒·格林：**好的，谢谢您。
