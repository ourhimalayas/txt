According to Sina news on September 22 2021, Wang Like,  the former secretary of the Jiangsu Political and Legal Committee, who voluntarily surrendered last year, was expelled from his party membership and public office.

Although Wang Like voluntarily surrendered to the police, during the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and State Supervision Committee briefing, it does not indicate the fact that he surrendered voluntarily and gave a truthful testimony of his disciplinary problems.

The briefing pointed out that Wang Like has serious violations of the party’s political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, and life discipline, constituting a serious job violation and suspected of bribery, and after the 18th Party Congress the violations still did not stop, thus should be dealt with seriously.

The news mentioned that previous senior CCP officials who voluntarily surrendered were treated in leniency, but Wang Like was an exceptional case, his problems must be very unusual.

Mr. Miles Guo previously mentioned that Wang Like is one of Meng Jianzhu’s three swordsmen, just like Sun Lijun, they are “mafia” in China. Wang Like, together with Sun Lijun and Wang Lijun, has a deeper impact on China politics than what “Gang of Four” did during the Culture Revolution. Wang Like and Luo Wenjin (another high-ranking Police officer from Jiangsu) who dared to murder Xi but eventually failed, are definitely treated in an extremely serious way inside the CCP. So this is a very “unusual” case in CCP history for sure.
