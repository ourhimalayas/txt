在[年轻的年龄组](https://childrenshealthdefense-org.translate.goog/defender/cdc-advisors-endorse-pfizers-covid-vaccine-kids-5-11/?_x_tr_sl=en&amp;_x_tr_tl=zh-CN&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB&amp;_x_tr_pto=nui)将获得三分之一授权对那些12岁以上的剂量，在给予至少相隔三周两针。剂量将通过较小的针头输送并储存在较小的小瓶中，以避免与成人剂量混淆。

CDC[担心](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&amp;tl=zh-CN&amp;nui=1&amp;u=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1102-PediatricCOVID-19Vaccine.html)儿童 COVID 病例可能导致住院、死亡、[多系统炎症综合征](https://childrenshealthdefense-org.translate.goog/defender/teen-multisystem-inflammatory-syndrome-myocarditis-pfizer-vaccine/?_x_tr_sl=en&amp;_x_tr_tl=zh-CN&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB&amp;_x_tr_pto=nui)(MIS-C) 和并发症，例如“长期 COVID”，其中症状可能持续数月。

CDC 的授权主要基于辉瑞-BioNTech 对全球 4,600 名儿童的研究，其中约 3,100 名儿童接种了低剂量疫苗，约 1,500 名接种了安慰剂。在疫苗组的 3,100 名儿童中，只有 264 名儿童接受了抗体测试，以确定辉瑞疫苗的功效。

4 月 16 日，奥乔亚通过她的雇主获得了她的第二剂辉瑞，并在 45 分钟内感到不适。她的整个身体都经历了恶心、极度腹泻和疼痛，并且逐渐恶化并在她的身体中肆虐。

奥乔亚在被确诊之前看过很多医生，在过去的六个月里一直试图治愈她的病情，这让她处于“可怕的痛苦”中，无法在没有帮助的情况下行走或自给自足。

奥乔亚说，她担心“他们对这种疫苗缺乏研究”，并且担心其他人即使没有像她那样立即受到影响，也有可能遭受长期后果。

“我晚上的噩梦是我们的孩子可能不得不忍受这一切，因为这些疫苗的真相并未被提及，”奥奇亚说。

**学校付钱让孩子们接种**** COVID ****疫苗**

一些学校正在付钱给孩子们接种 COVID 疫苗。[据 TIME 报道](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&amp;tl=zh-CN&amp;nui=1&amp;u=https://time.com/6114092/kids-vaccines-schools/)，凤凰城的学校正在发放 100 美元的礼品卡。在洛杉矶，如果学生中奖，他们可以赢取礼品卡、免费舞会或返校门票。

路易斯安那州[向](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&amp;tl=zh-CN&amp;nui=1&amp;u=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/11/05/incentives-kids-get-covid-vaccine-include-money-gift-cards/6300733001/)接种疫苗的儿童[提供 100 美元](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&amp;tl=zh-CN&amp;nui=1&amp;u=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/11/05/incentives-kids-get-covid-vaccine-include-money-gift-cards/6300733001/)，德克萨斯州圣安东尼奥市的官员宣布，父母可以在 HEB 杂货店领取 100 美元的礼品卡。在纽约市，[年仅 5 岁的儿童](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&amp;tl=zh-CN&amp;nui=1&amp;u=https://time.com/6114092/kids-vaccines-schools/) 接种疫苗就可以获得报酬。

纽约市长比尔·德布拉西奥 (Bill de Blasio) 周四表示：“我们真的希望[孩子们能够利用这一点](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&amp;tl=zh-CN&amp;nui=1&amp;u=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/11/05/incentives-kids-get-covid-vaccine-include-money-gift-cards/6300733001/)，家庭也能利用这一点。” “每个人都可以在假期前后多花一点钱。但最重要的是，我们希望我们的孩子和家人都安全。”

一些批评人士说，付钱给孩子接种疫苗是贿赂，但鼓励孩子们的学区认为这是有道理的，因为它可以保证学生和教职员工的安全。
