焦点节目-Stephanie Hamill 与 Gordan Chang

The reduction of CO2 emissions is an important policy. So is national security. And what Russia and China have done here, they have taken advantage of the effort to reduce CO2 emissions, which to the Biden administration means a frontal assault on oil and gas. It’s so clear what’s happening.

减少二氧化碳排放是一项重要政策。也是关系到国家安全。俄罗斯和中国现在的所作所为是，他们利用了减少二氧化碳排放的努力，这对拜登政府来说意味着对石油和天然气的正面攻击。正在发生的事情已经很清楚了。

0:42
That was Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana highlighting how our dependence and Europe’s dependence on Russian oil is national security suicide. And it is, as Russia continues its attacks on Ukraine, the US and allies are funding the war machine by continuing business with Russia. It defies logic. Now, there are other things to consider in regards to national security, like how the invasion of Ukraine will impact Russia’s relationship with China. Historically speaking, Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea brought the two closer together. So now some are wondering if this invasion could do the same. Joining me now to weigh in, columnist and author of the books “The Coming Collapse of China”, and “The Great US-China Tech War”, Gordon Chang. Gordon, thank you so much for joining me. So, Gordon, do you share these concerns about what’s going on and the possibility of this invasion pushing China and Russia together?

路易斯安那州参议员约翰-肯尼迪所强调：我们对俄罗斯石油的依赖和欧洲对俄罗斯石油的依赖对国家安全来说是自杀。而事实也是如此，因为在俄罗斯继续攻击乌克兰的时候，美国和其盟国还在通过继续与俄罗斯做生意来资助这个战争机器。这违背逻辑。现在，在国家安全方面还有其他事情要考虑，比如入侵乌克兰将如何影响俄罗斯与中国的关系。从历史上看，俄罗斯2014年对克里米亚的吞并使中俄两国关系更加紧密。因此，现在有些人在想，这次入侵(乌克兰)是否能起到同样的作用。现在有请专栏作家、《中国即将崩溃》和《中美科技大战》一书的作者，章家敦。家敦，非常感谢您来到这个节目。那么，家敦，您是否也对正在发生的这些事情感到担忧，是否担忧这种入侵可能将中（共）国和俄罗斯推到一起？

1:35
Oh, China and Russia are very close right now. And of course, our sanctions, especially freezing dollar accounts, kicking Russian institutions off the SWIFT, is going to push Russia into China’s economic orbit and into its financial orbit. So out of SWIFT, it then goes into CIPS, which is a cross border interbank payment system, which is China’s version of SWIFT. But you know, Stephanie, these two countries were very close together, even before the sanctions. They’ve been coordinating their foreign policies, they’re coordinating their militaries, they’re trying to make them inter-operable. So, this is going to be basically Russia and China forming an axis. And in some sense, you know, Russia, the weak state could actually drag down China. So this might not be a bad thing for us.

中国和俄罗斯现在走得非常近。当然，我们的制裁，特别是冻结美元账户，将俄罗斯机构踢出SWIFT，将把俄罗斯推向中国的经济轨道和金融轨道。所以离开SWIFT，俄罗斯进入CIPS，这是一个跨境银行间支付系统，这是中国的SWIFT版本。但是你知道，斯蒂芬妮，这两个国家甚至是在制裁之前就走得非常近。他们一直在协调他们的外交政策，他们正在协调他们的军队，他们正试图使它们互相配合。所以，基本上俄罗斯和中国形成了一个轴心。在某种意义上，你知道，俄罗斯这个弱国实际上可以拖垮中国。所以 这对我们来说可能不是一件坏事。

2:23
Yeah, that’s a good point. Now, some are definitely concerned about how the Russian sanctions will impact our global financial system. And you kind of touched on that a bit. And what and also too, if you could further explain what that would even mean for the American dollar.

是的，这是个很好的观点。现在，一些人肯定担心对俄罗斯的制裁将如何影响我们的全球金融体系。您也提到了这一点。您是否能进一步解释一下这对美元意味着什么？

2:37
US dollar is the world’s reserve currency. It is, you know, the Euro is, of course, important, Sterling is important, yen. But by far the dollar underpins the global financial system. And China has for decades tried to dethrone the dollar. Now, they really can’t do it because their currency is not convertible on a capital account. Nobody trusts Beijing to manage their currency fairly. And as well, you can’t have a global reserve currency if you don’t run persistent current account deficits. And China runs persistent surpluses. So there’s not enough renminbi in the world. So there are a lot of reasons. Nevertheless, we should not take this for granted. Because China every day in every way tries to attack our dollar. And they’re doing it now, during the Ukraine war.

美元是世界上的储备货币。你知道，欧元，当然，重要，英镑也很重要，日元也很重要。但到目前为止，美元还是全球金融体系的基础。几十年来，中国一直试图削弱美元的地位。现在，他们真的做不到，因为他们的货币不能在资本账户上兑换。没有人相信北京能公平地管理他们的货币。而且，你不可能拥有一个全球储备货币，如果你没有持续的活期账户赤字。中国有持续的盈余。所以世界上没有足够的人民币。所以有很多原因。但尽管如此，我们不应该认为这是理所当然的。因为中国每天以各种方式试图攻击我们的美元。他们现在在乌克兰战争期间就在这样做。

3:25
As you pointed out, there was already an existing cozy relationship between Russia and China. And I guess my question was, you know, how much more would that become after this invasion, as Russia becomes more isolated? That being said, there were reports out there that China actually asked Russia to wait until after the Olympics to invade Ukraine? Number one, do you believe these reports? And number two, what does that say about our relationship with China?

正如您所指出的，俄罗斯和中国之间已经存在着亲密的关系。我想我的问题是，在这次入侵之后，随着俄罗斯变得更加孤立，他们的关系会变得更加亲蜜吗？有报道说，中国实际上要求俄罗斯等到冬奥会之后再入侵乌克兰？第一，你相信这些报道吗？第二，对于我们与中国的关系，这说明了什么？

3:52
Those reports, indeed, are credible. You know, we’ve also seen other things that back that up. So for instance, the New York Times reported that Biden officials talked to China to try to get the Chinese to constrain Russia, we shared intelligence with them. And the Chinese then did two things, Stephanie. They rebuffed us, and then they took our intelligence and they gave it to the Russians. So this is really a clear sign of partnership between China and Russia. And we can expect these two states and their proxies to continue to attack the international system, and more particularly, attack us. And we have to understand the Chinese mentality right now. There are a lot of people in the Biden administration who want to have a good relationship with Beijing, but you can’t do it as long as the communist party is in power.

这些报告，确实是可信的。你知道，我们也看到了其他的东西，证实了这一点。例如《纽约时报》报道说，拜登的官员与中国交谈，试图让中国人限制俄罗斯。我们与他们分享情报。然后，中国人做了两件事，斯蒂芬妮。他们回绝了我们；然后他们把我们的情报给了俄罗斯人。因此，这是中国和俄罗斯之间伙伴关系的一个明显迹象。我们可以预期这两个国家和他们的代理人将继续攻击国际体系，特别是攻击我们。我们必须了解中国人现在的心态。在拜登政府中有很多人希望与北京保持良好的关系。但只要共产党执政，你就不能这样做。

4:38
And there’s a lot of speculation or questions and attention being brought to the fact that China might be using this invasion as a blueprint in regards to their plans with Taiwan. Do you think that they are watching this closely?

有很多猜测或问题，以及人们都在关注中国可能利用这次入侵作为他们对台湾计划的蓝图。您认为他们正在密切关注此事吗？

4:54
Absolutely. China right now is going through what it calls its two sessions. One of them is the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress. And on Saturday, the central government gave its work report. And in that work report, they were very clear, they said that Taiwan would be a next “within the new era”. And by that they probably mean within the next decade, Xi Jinping gave some hint in 2019 that this meant at least one generation, or at least while he was in power. So he staked his credibility and his legitimacy on taking over Taiwan. Beijing is working very, very closely, and watching very, very closely what’s going on. And we have to now start deterring China, because we obviously failed to deter Russia, despite our great disparity in power in our favor. This was a failure, one of the greatest failures in American diplomacy, was to watch while this war started.

绝对的。中国现在正在经历它所谓的两会。其中之一是全国人民代表大会的年度会议。在星期六，中央政府提交了工作报告。在该工作报告中，他们非常清楚地说，台湾将成为下一个 “新时代 “的国家。他们所说的可能意味着在未来十年内(收复台湾)，习近平在2019年就给出了一些暗示，这意味着至少有一代人，或者至少在他执政期间(收复台湾)。所以他把自己的信誉和合法性押在了收复台湾上。北京正在非常，非常密切地工作，并且非常、非常密切地关注正在发生的事情。我们现在必须开始威慑中国，因为我们显然未能威慑俄罗斯，尽管在实力上的巨大差距对我们有利。这是一次失败，是美国外交中最大的失败之一，就是在这场战争开始时袖手旁观。

5:51
Yeah, it’s what we’ve heard from the Ukrainian president that he’s thankful for all the help, but it’s a little bit late, and that there could have been so much more done before Russia had invaded at this level. Now, we did hear from former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he was talking about how the US should formally recognize Taiwan as a country. Is that something that you think would be a good idea?

是的，我们从乌克兰总统那里听到的是，他感谢所有的帮助，但这有点晚了，而且在俄罗斯入侵到这种程度之前，本可以做更多的事情。现在，我们确实听到了前国务卿迈克-蓬佩奥的发言，他谈到了美国应该如何正式承认台湾是一个国家。您认为这是个好主意吗？

6:14
It’s a great idea. And in addition, we should offer a mutual defense treaty to Taipei if they want it. The problem is Ukraine didn’t have security guarantees. It was not a member of NATO. And although we signed the Budapest Memorandum in December 1994, which was an implicit guarantee, obviously, we did not step in to prevent the Russians from violating their Budapest Memorandum obligations. So we need to have a full relationship with Taiwan. If we do that, China probably is not going to invade because they don’t want to take on the United States. They don’t want the casualties. And there’s a whole bunch of other reasons. So this is a great idea on the part of Secretary Pompeo.

这是个很棒的主意。此外，我们应该向台北提供一个共同防御条约，如果他们想要的话。问题是乌克兰没有安全保障。它不是北约的成员。尽管我们在1994年12月签署了《布达佩斯备忘录》，这是一个隐含的保证。显然，我们没有介入，以防止俄罗斯人违反其《布达佩斯备忘录》的义务。因此，我们需要与台湾有一个全面的关系。如果我们这样做，中国可能不会入侵，因为他们不想与美国对抗。他们不希望出现伤亡。而且还有一大堆其他原因。因此，这是美国国务卿蓬佩奥的一个伟大想法。

6:58
On its face, it sounds great, but I’m sure it’s much more complicated than that. Because I don’t think China would sit around and say, “oh, you know, whatever, that’s fine”. I’m sure there would be some sort of revenge or some sort of implications that would hurt us here as well.

从表面上看，这听起来很好，但我确信它比这要复杂得多。因为我不认为中国会坐以待毙，说，”哦，你知道，不管怎样，这很好。”我肯定会有某种报复或某种影响，也会伤害到我们。

7:12
There would be, but you got to remember, Stephanie, that after three decades of misguided China policy, and indeed misguided foreign policy altogether, and that’s all Presidents. By the way, we have no options which are not dangerous. Every option going forward is really grim. And this is our fault because we’ve had presidents who have not defended the United States, and who have not defended the broader international system. And that’s why China and Russia now are moving against their neighbors. And we are at an inflection point where probably the world going forward is not going to be peaceful. This is going to be an entirely new era, as the Chinese say, and it’s not an era that we’re going to like.

会有的，但你要记住，斯蒂芬妮，经过三十年的误导性中国政策，和误导性的外交政策，这些都是 总统们干的。顺便说一下，我们没有不危险的选择。每一个选择都是非常严峻的。这是我们的错，因为我们已经有一些总统，他们没有捍卫美国，也没有捍卫更广泛的国际体系。这就是为什么中国和俄罗斯现在正在对其邻国采取行动。而我们正处于一个拐点，世界的未来可能不会是和平的。正如中国人所说，这将是一个全新的时代，而这并不是一个我们喜欢的时代。

7:53
Yeah, sounds so disturbing, such a grim picture. Well, Gordon, we’re going to leave it here. We appreciate your insight. Thank you so much.

是的，听起来很令人不安，这样一个严峻的画面。好吧，家敦，我们先聊到这里。我们感谢您的深入见解。非常感谢您。

7:59
Thank you, Stephanie.

谢谢你，斯蒂芬妮。

8:00
Thank you.

谢谢！
