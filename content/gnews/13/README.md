**郭文贵**
**Miles Guo**

另外一个，我再重申一遍
Another one, I reiterate

任何战友，特别是投资战友不准随便发言
Any comrades, especially ones with investment are not allowed to comment freely

你要承担法律后果
You will be bearded the legal consequences

你要承担法律（后果）
You have to bear the legal consequences

你是战友，因为你拿的一毛钱买的币，这是跟给你没啥两样
You are a comrade in arms because of you have the HCoins with ten cents purchase price benefit which is no different from giving you for nothing,

倒贴钱给你，你还在那块儿
and also back paying you the money. You are still there to criticize

哎呦，真把自己当成投资者身份了
Wow, you really identified yourself as investors

然后在那块儿批评，你以为你是伪类啊
and then, criticize here and there. You thought you are under-covered communist?

是不是？你想骂就骂，你想干啥就干啥
Don’t you? You can criticize whatever you want and do whatever you want

你拿了一毛钱的币，你就必须维护这个币
You have gotten the coin at a dime, you must defend the coin

这点要求一点不过分吧？
This is not too much to ask, right?

特别是对铁血组，特别是对联盟委员会
Especially to the Iron Blood Group and the Farm Alliance Committee,

你要保持配合和尊重
you have to maintain cooperation and respect

我们接下来最关键的事情
The next most critical thing for us

以最快的时间把每个农场的代持的币一个不能少
is to clarify the coins held by each farm as soon as possible, not one less

这个代持币会是天大的事儿
The coins will be a huge deal

这真是一币难求
It’s really hard to acquire another coin

接下来就是一币可以毁人呐
then, it may destroy others just for one coin

这个事儿，老班长在这呢，我求求你了
Please Old Squad Leader

你再不弄，下次直播我就天天在那喊你
if you don’t do that, I’ll call you out each time on the future live broadcast

因为后果是你先负责，第二就是长岛哥，然后就是联盟委员会，农场主
Because you are the first one for the responsibility of the consequence, then Brother Long Island, and following by the Alliance Committee, the farm owner

你农场主，你不能拿着钱你不干事儿
As the farm owner you cannot take the money without doing anything

而且我们真的要清除农场里的很多坏人
And we really need to remove a lot of bad people in the farm

就我们现在农场主说啥事，共产党就知道
because now we have farm owners who say anything and the CCP know it right away

这是很可怕的
It’s very scary

把代持的币，还有一些所谓的假义工报的币，各农场你真要查清楚
You really have to check the coins held on behalf of the farms and the coins reported by the so-called fake volunteers

这假义工报的币，就刚才我说那个例子，这很多了
There are a lot of fake volunteer coins, just like the example I mentioned earlier

他拿了币一定不干别的，就砸你
They will not do any others but destroying the market after they got the coins

还有没有签合同的，是吧？
And also they haven’t signed a contract, right?

你必须得把他的币给他收了
You have to confiscate their coins

因为你整个联盟委员会要负责任
because your entire Farm Alliance Committee is responsible for it

人家喜联储不管你那个
Himalaya Reserve won’t care about that

反正我的币给你了，你爱怎么弄怎么弄，它才不管呢
They provided you coins, you can do whatever you like, and they don’t care

但是你老班长，你长岛哥，各农场主
But you all, Old Squad Leader, Brother Long Island, the farm owners

你要是把这个币给错了，他们拿这个币来砸的时候
if you give these coins to wrong individuals, when they use this coin to destroy our market

对不起，你们必须负责任
Sorry, you must be responsible for it

这是七哥要求你要为新中国联邦负责
This is my demand that asking you to be responsible for the New Federal State of China,

你要为七万七千个战友负责任
and to our 77,000 comrades
