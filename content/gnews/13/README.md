##### 作者：加拿大温哥华扬帆农场 – 视频组

Speaker 1:
未来你是否想看到这样一幅画面， 一只靴子始终踩踏在人的脸上，危险的噩梦描绘出的寓意很简单， 就是不要让其发生，这取决于你。

Speaker 2
他们已意识到正将数亿人带上一条藏匿着未知野兽的道路， 沙拉说这野兽就像哈维尔一样生长， 现在病毒比以往任何时刻都糟糕。打了疫苗又如何？ 我们其实比一年前没有接种疫苗时情况更糟， 这个你如何解释？ 所有这一切加起来将会把我们带入前所未有的危险境地。我一直在说他们很厉害， 因为他们已经意识到犯下了一个巨大的错误。

Speaker 3
你认为疾病控制中心和其它机构在处理新发现的病例时获取了错误信息吗？完全接种疫苗的人在不断遭到病毒感染， 专家们反复强调新的染病记录是罕见的， 这几乎消除了所有人的恐惧， 但是我们如果能够对所预期的结果给出更细致的解释不是更好吗？

Speaker 4:
我认为我们必须认识到世界上有1.64亿人接种了疫苗， 也有有成千上万的新感染病例即发生。
好的， 那么我的问题是：“如果我完全接种了疫苗还会感染病毒吗？

Speaker 5：
会。
好吧， 如果我感染了病毒， 我还会传播病毒吗？
是的， 你仍然可能会传播病毒。
在即将到来的10月18日， 我们工作场所中所有未接种疫苗的人都必须接受检测才能继续工作， 那么我接种疫苗后仍然可能感染并传播病毒，为什么我不需要测试却可以继续工作呢？
这是一个很好的问题， 我不知道答案。
所以即使我是一个完全接种了疫苗的人， 我仍然可能会感染我的客户， 甚至是在我不知道的情况下。但我想至少这些没有接种疫苗的人将对此有感知， 因为他们每周要接受三次检测。  
 
是的。
所以接种疫苗是毫无道理的。

The following will be … after Speaker 5.
No, there are still a lot of questions surrounding Absolutely.
是的，绝对还有很多问题。
Speaker 6
vaccines are safe and effective for use. Vaccines are the best way for you to protect yourself, your family,
and your community.  
疫苗的使用是安全有效的，疫苗是你保护自己、家人和社区的最佳方式。

Speaker 7
We are starting to see waning immunity against infection and waning immunity in the beginning aspect against hospitalization. And if you look at Israel, which is always been a month to a month and a half ahead of us in the dynamics of the outbreak in the vaccine response. And in every other element of the outbreak, they are seeing a waning of immunity not only against infection, but against hospitalizations, and to some extent death, which is starting to now involve all age groups. It isn’t just the elderly.

我们开始看到人体中预防感染的免疫力在不断减弱，对入住医院的患者来说免疫力也开始在减弱。你可以关注一下以色列，它在疫苗反应动态爆发方面总是比我们领先一个月到一个半月。在疫苗导致的所有后果中，他们看到的是免疫力的减弱，不仅是对感染的免疫力，而且包括对住院人员的免疫力，以及在某种程度上对死亡的免疫力。现在不仅仅是老年人的事，已经开始涉及所有年龄组。

Speaker 8
Fully vaccinated, Gary Weston died after COVID-19 swept through his men’s hockey league.
完全接种疫苗的加里-韦斯顿，在新冠病毒侵蚀他的男子曲棍球联盟后死亡。

Speaker 9 & 10
The outbreak now the focus of an investigation highlighting situations where virus transmission remains a real concern to nicer of a new market men’s rec Hockey League searching for answers after 15 fully vaccinated players became infected with COVID 19 Earlier this month, including 75-year-old Gary Weston who died last week in the hospital.

病毒爆发是现在调查的重点，突出了病毒传播仍然是最令人担忧的情况。15位完全接种疫苗的球员，在本月早些时候感染了新冠，新市场男子曲棍球联盟正在寻找合理的解释，包括上周在医院去世的75岁的加里-韦斯顿。

Speaker 11

As of May 2021. I am fully vaccinated. I caught COVID I’ve infected my dad. I’ve been taking infected my mom who is both vaccinated. My son 14 years old, has both of these Pfizer shots now has COVID I didn’t think to my ex-wife, I did not think to my daughter and I infected my family. My kids, people I love most and I’m fully vaccinated. I got sick, I went and got tested. My test came back negative because my viral load wasn’t high enough. Because I’m fully vaccinated. my viral load didn’t get high enough to the test to test positive. The people out there pushing this vaccine or not telling you the full truth.

截至2021年5月，我已接种完所有的疫苗，但是我感染了新冠病毒，并且已经传染给了我的父亲和母亲，他们都接种了疫苗，我14岁的儿子，接种了两针辉瑞疫苗，现在感染了新冠病毒。 我不认为是我的前妻或者我的女儿传染了我，而是我传染了我的家人。我的孩子们，他们是我最爱的人。我已经完全接种疫苗还是生病了，我去做测试，测试结果是阴性，因为我的病毒含量不够高。因为我已经完全接种了疫苗，当时的病毒量没有高到可以测试出阳性。外面的人推崇这种疫苗，还不告诉你全部真相。
 
Speaker 12
And those who are vaccinated we now know based on the CDC, they are now able we but with a Delta variant because they carry so much more virus They could transmit it to their unvaccinated family members. And so I, for example, even though I’m fully vaccinated, my children are not because they’re too young to be vaccinated, so I need to be down careful for my children, because of all the unvaccinated people around us.

根据疾病控制中心报告，接种疫苗的人可以传播病毒，但有一个Delta变种病毒，携带了更多的病毒，可以将病毒传播给未接种疫苗的家庭成员。举例来说，我已经完全接种了疫苗，但我的孩子却没有，因为他们太小，无法接种疫苗，所以我需要为我的孩子小心谨慎，因为我们周围有很多未接种疫苗的人。

Speaker 13
The people who were in hospital yesterday 78% vaccinated, and 17 were partially vaccinated.
昨天在医院的人中，78%的人接种了疫苗，17人部分接种了疫苗。

Speaker 14
As the minister said, tragically, today, we announced the deaths of seven people who have lost their lives to COVID-19 for Women and three men. One person was in their 40s, one person in their 50s Two people in their 70s Two people in their 80s and one person who was in their 90s. All of those individuals who had underlying health conditions. One person was not vaccinated. Three people had received one dose of a COVID vaccine, and three people had received two doses of a COVID vaccine.
正如部长所说，今天我们很遗憾地宣布有7人死于新冠病毒，有4名女性和3名男性。一个40多岁，一个50多岁 , 两人是70多岁,两人是80多岁，还有一人90多岁。所有这些人都有潜在的健康问题。一个人没有接种疫苗，三个人接种过一剂新冠疫苗，还有三个人接种过两剂新冠疫苗。

Speaker 15.
Information from the CDC tonight is turning crucial things we were told about COVID upside down. The CDC revealing tonight that 74% of COVID cases in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, home to Provincetown, where there was a recent outbreak were found in people who were fully vaccinated. And they say now that the vaccinated are just as likely to spread the viruses those who are not vaccinated.

今晚来自疾病控制中心的信息，我们获知的关于新冠的关键事情被颠覆了。疾病控制中心今晚披露，在马萨诸塞州巴恩斯特布尔县最近爆发的新冠病例中，74%的病例是在完全接种疫苗的人身上发现的。他们现在说，接种疫苗的人和未接种疫苗的人一样可能传播病毒。
 
Speaker 13
141 people are in hospital with COVID that present and 43 are in intensive care 18 of whom require ventilation. So this is a very serious disease. Of those 141 60 are under the age of 55 and 28, under the age of 35. And of the 43 people in intensive care. One is in their teens, seven are in their 20s Three are in their 30s 14 are in their 50s and 12 are in their 60s and six are in their 70s so this is affecting people of all ages with very serious disease over one of vaccinated one person visitors to received one dose of vaccine.
目前有141人因新冠住院，43人在重症监护室，其中18人需要呼吸设备，这是一种非常严重的疾病。当然在这141人中，60人年龄在55岁以下，28人年龄在35岁以下。而在接受重症监护的43人中，一个10几岁，7个20多岁，3个30多岁，14个50多岁，12个是60多岁，6个是70多岁。由此可见这影响了所有年龄段的人，他们病得非常严重。有一个人接种完所有的疫苗，还有一个人接种了一剂疫苗。

Speaker 16.
Top Biden health officials were grilled by lawmakers for hours on Capitol Hill yesterday over the frustrating state of the pandemic. And one very blunt assessment the acting head of the FDA said most people are going to get the virus.
昨天，拜登的高级卫生官员在国会山庄就令人沮丧的大流行病状况，接受了立法者数小时的质询。而美国食品和药物管理局代理局长的一个非常直率的评估是，大多数人都将感染病毒。

Speaker 17.
Most people are going to get COVID. Alright, and what we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function。
大多数人将会感染新冠病毒，好吧，我们现在需要做的是确保医院仍然能够运行。
Speaker 7
Omicron with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody. Unfortunately, those who are still unvaccinated are going to get the brunt of the severe aspect of this.
奥米克戎以其非凡的、史无前例的传播效率，最终几乎会感染所有人。不幸的是，那些仍未接种疫苗的人将首当其冲受到严重影响。

Speaker 16

This is the first time that these health officials have testified in front of lawmakers since the emergence of the Democrat Omicron variant. Of course, the concerns over this nationwide shortage of rapid testing.
 
这是自欧米茄变种出现以来，这些卫生官员第一次在立法者面前作证。当然，全国性的快速检测短缺状况更令人担忧。

Speaker 18
This slide is showing the proportion of breakthrough cases in the province that are experienced by First Nations people keeping in mind that we make up roughly 10% of the population, what we can see is that the proportion among breakthrough cases, hospitalizations, ICU outcomes and fatalities remains higher after vaccination.
这张幻灯片显示了该省原住民中新发现病例的比例，大约占人口的10%，我们可以看到，在接种疫苗后，新发现病例、住院、ICU结果和死亡的比例仍然较高。

Speaker 19
Like we’re like, read and taught to be like, like, vaccine is safer than than actually getting COVID That’s like, honestly, we have to we have to do so many seminars on this like we have to like sit there for hours and hours and listen to like be like you cannot like talk about this public. So logically though, like if you have antibodies built off like you should be able to prove that you have those. Missing I don’t know maybe, potentially. That’s crazy.
就像我们一样，不断的被洗脑，例如接种疫苗比不接种感染到新冠更安全。说实话，我们必须做许多研讨会，必须坐在那里几个小时，听着诸如不能谈论公众敏感话题等等。从逻辑上讲，虽然你体内有抗体，但是我不知道，所以你要证明你有那些，这很疯狂。
 
Speaker 20
I had COVID and I have monster immunity after eight months. So I just got checked last month for antibody.
我得了新冠病毒，八个月后奇怪的我有了免疫力，所以上个月我检查了抗体。
I mean, that’s not the same thing with my brother.
我的意思是，这和我哥哥的情况不一样。
So should I get the vaccine？
那么我是否应该接种疫苗？
Wait
等等。
If you’re immunity starts to wane, then get vaccinated.
如果你的免疫力开始减弱，那么就去接种疫苗。
So I mean, well protected？
所以我的意思是，我被保护得好？
Yeah
是的。
like as much as the vaccine。  
就像疫苗越多，被保护的越好？
Probably more 
可能更好
OK, how much?
好的， 那多少？
Speaker 21

I mean. So, when we came out with so right now we’re seeing an increase in the Delta variant, mostly not because of the variant, because a new there, basically, their antibodies are waning. So they’re, they’re still protected, but not at that 95%. efficacy, it’s more like 70%. So you’re being you’re protected, most likely for longer since it was a natural response. So basically, they’re trying to keep track of everyone that’s been vaccinated versus the census. So how many people are actually reported? So I mean, they’re trying to get their numbers but still, you shouldn’t have to show anything, which is basically in my opinion, a violation of HIPAA. They no one has the right to ask you if you’ve been vaccinated or so it’s an invasion of privacy. I don’t agree with the study’s people it.
现在当我们提出这个问题时，我们发现新增的德尔塔变种病毒，主要不是因为变种，而是一个新的病毒，基本上他们的抗体正在减弱，所以他们仍然受到保护，但不是95%。功效更像是70%，所以你被保护了。因为这是一种自然反应，所以很可能保护的时间更长。 因此，他们正试图对照人口普查跟踪每一个接种疫苗的人的情况。那么，实际上有多少人被报告？他们试图得到数字，但仍然不显示什么。在我看来，这基本上是违反了健康保险可携性和责任法案（HIPAA）。他们没有权利问你是否接种过疫苗，所以这是对隐私的侵犯，我不同意做调查的人们。
 
Normally, missing… here
And the people that have been vaccinated not doing any testing.
而那些已经接种疫苗的人没有做任何测试。

Speaker 22 + Speaker 23
Now you got this guy in room four, who got his second dose of vaccine on Tuesday has been short of breath. Okay. Now his BMP is elevated D dimer, elevated LT all his liver enzymes are elevated. His pt, pt, INR, myocarditis. (missing) All this is due to the vaccine, right, but now they’re not going to blame the vaccine. Well, and you know what, but he has an obligation to report that doesn’t happen, right? What is it 60 days after if you see they have gone through, but how many people are reporting
,they are not reporting right, because they want to show it under the under the map.
现在四号房间有个人，他星期二注射了第二剂疫苗，一直呼吸短促，现在他的基础代谢数据升高了，D二聚体升高了，LT （low-tension）低压值升高了，所有的肝酶都升高了。他的pt(paroxysmal tachycardia) 阵发性心动过速，凝血酶原时间（PT）INR(国际正常化比率），心肌炎等，所有这些都是由于疫苗造成的。对吧，但现在他们不打算责备疫苗了，但他有义务报告，但是他们没有这么做，对吧。60天后发生了什么，你看到他们已经检查了，但是有多少人在报告里？
没有， 他们没有准确地报告，因为他们想要数字显示在图像下面。

Speaker 24

In Taiwan the number of people dying after their COVID vaccination is exceeding the number of deaths from the virus itself. Taiwan’s Health authorities say that as of Monday, deaths after vaccination reached 865. All deaths from the virus are at 845. Vaccines currently offered in Taiwan include AstraZeneca Maderna, Pfizer bio Intek and Taiwan’s own vaccine managin. Out of the 865 deaths after vaccination over 600 were from AstraZeneca and nearly 200 deaths after Maderna shocked shot.
在台湾，接种COVID疫苗后死亡的人数超过了病毒本身的死亡人数。台湾卫生当局说，截至周一，接种疫苗后的死亡人数达到865人。所有死于该病毒的人数为845人。目前在台湾提供的疫苗包括阿斯利康，玛德纳(AstraZeneca， Maderna)，辉瑞生物Intek和台湾自己的疫苗Managin。在接种疫苗后的865死亡案例中， 600多例来自阿斯利康，近200例死于玛德纳。

Speaker 25
Yeah guys, you know a new analysis find several counties with above average vaccination rates also have higher COVID case rates, while case rates are actually falling in counties with below average vaccination rates. statewide data analyzed by the Bay Area News Group found these five counties Los Angeles, San Diego Alameda Contra Costa and San Francisco have both a higher percentage of people fully vaccinated than the state average and a higher average daily case rate. Compare that to these five counties Modak Glen Lassen Del Norte and San Benito, which have below average vaccination rates and decreasing case rates.
是的，伙计们，一项新的分析发现，几个疫苗接种率高于平均水平的县也有较高的新冠病例率，而疫苗接种率低于平均水平的县的病例率实际上在下降。湾区新闻集团分析的全州数据发现，洛杉矶、圣地亚哥、阿拉米达、康特拉-科斯塔和旧金山这五个县，完全接种疫苗的人口比例高于全州平均水平，平均每天的病例率也较高。与这五个县相比，莫达克-格伦-拉森-德尔诺特和圣贝尼托的疫苗接种率低于平均水平，而病例率在下降。

Speaker 17

Because I’m like really relying on the vaccine to kind of in hopes cure this pandemic Brittany
因为我真的很依赖疫苗，一种希望能治愈这种大流行病。

Speaker 26
Brittany Tucker, one of the many people eager to get the vaccine and get on with life. But fear of the unknown is why Eric Pora doesn’t want to get the vaccine in the first place.
This was rushed just so fast。
Hearing of a person dying though hours after being vaccinated just leave Brittany uneasy,
布列塔尼-塔克，是众多渴望获得疫苗并继续生活的人之一。但对未知的恐惧是埃里克-波拉从一开始就不想接种疫苗的原因。
太匆忙，太快了。
听到一个人在接种疫苗后几个小时就死亡的消息，这让布列塔尼感到不安。
but now I think it’s definitely something I probably should put more research into
现在我认为这绝对是我应该多加研究的事情。

Speaker 27
It’s evaluating the medical records of 28 people who died after taking the COVID-19 vaccine 24 of them had taken the Pfizer jab. The Authority has received over 3700 reports of adverse effects.
正在评估28名接种新冠疫苗后死亡的人的医疗记录，其中24人曾接种辉瑞疫苗，当局已收到3700多份不良反应的报告。
 
 Speaker  28

Australia’s medical regulator is investigating the deaths of two people in New South Wales. They died just days after receiving the COVID vaccine. The Norwegian
澳大利亚的医疗监管机构正在调查新南威尔士州两人的死亡事件。他们在接受新冠疫苗几天后死亡。

Speaker 29

The Norwegian Medicines Agency first reported on Thursday that 23 elderly people had died in a short time after receiving their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine 13 of which may have suffered from deadly side effects. However, the number of deaths has been updated to 29 people or sub-Sunday according to Bloomberg, according to the agency, all Eggs these are linked to the Pfizer vaccine.
挪威药品管理局周四首次报告说，23名老人在接受第一剂辉瑞疫苗后短时间内死亡，其中13人可能遭受了致命的副作用。然而，据彭博社报道，死亡人数已更新为29人，或下周日，据该机构称所有这些都与辉瑞疫苗有关。

Speaker 30
In breaking news, a Central Coast woman has died after receiving a COVID vaccine Paul Kanak has the details for what’s happened.
在重磅新闻中，一名中央海岸的妇女在接种新冠疫苗后死亡，保罗-卡纳克提供了事情的详细信息。
 
Speaker 31
Well Mark New South Wales Health has now confirmed reports a woman from the Central Coast believed to be 48 years old has died after developing blood clots. She had received a COVID vaccine on Friday and it was hospitalized on Saturday. The woman who reportedly suffered from diabetes was put into intensive care but sadly died yesterday.
新南威尔士州卫生部现已证实，一名来自中央海岸的48岁妇女在出现血栓后死亡。她在周五接种了新冠疫苗，周六被送入医院。据报道，这名患有糖尿病的妇女被送入重症监护室，但不幸于昨天去世。

Speaker 32
A Kansas woman died shortly after getting the shot. Tonight investigators are trying to figure out if the vaccine is to blame. The State Health Department says Jeannie Evans had a severe allergic reaction after getting the shot. She was taken to the hospital in Topeka. She died.
堪萨斯州的一名妇女在注射疫苗后不久死亡。今晚，调查人员正试图弄清是否是疫苗造成的。州卫生局说，珍妮-埃文斯在注射疫苗后出现了严重的过敏反应，她被送往托皮卡的医院，她过世了。

Speaker 31

We began the night though with a West Michigan mother’s death 11 days after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.  right now. 530 how
我们今晚的节目从西密歇根州一位母亲接种强生公司疫苗11天后死亡开始。

Speaker 33
Right now, 530 how safe is the Pfizer COVID vaccine. We are investigating the death of a South Florida doctor who passed away two weeks after getting his shot.
现在，530 辉瑞公司的新冠疫苗安全性如何？我们正在调查南佛罗里达州一名医生的死亡事件，他在打完疫苗两周后去世。

Speaker 32
In 18 days since Lisa Jones unexpectedly lost her mother Janae Keys, she still has no answers as to why or how she died. We had a memorial service last week, the 58-year-old Gloucester resident died less than an hour after getting the Pfizer vaccine.
自从丽莎·琼斯意外失去母亲珍娜·凯斯以来的，18天过去了，她仍然不知道自己母亲为什么或如何死去的。
上周我们举行了追悼会，这位 58 岁的格洛斯特居民在接种辉瑞疫苗后不到一个小时就去世了。
 
Speaker 34
The composition of current COVID-19 vaccines may need to be updated to ensure they continue to provide WHO recommended levels of protection against infection and disease. That Kovac also said that a vaccination strategy based on repeated booster doses of the original vaccine composition is unlikely to be sustainable.
目前新冠疫苗的成分可能需要更新，来确保它们继续成为世卫组织推荐的感染和疾病的保护方案。Kovac 还说，基于原始疫苗成分的多级强化剂量的疫苗接种策略不太可能持续。

Speaker 35
we will create a $1 billion COVID-19 proof of vaccination. So with your premier wherever you are across the country if your premier mandates that everyone in your local restaurant or gym or other nonessential locations, must be fully vaccinated and show proof. We’ll pay for the development and rollout of that program. A vaccine mandate for nonessential businesses is a good idea. It keeps people safe. It encourages everyone to do the right thing. It keeps our businesses open, and it keeps our economy rebuilding.
我们将创建一个10亿美元的病毒疫苗接种证明。因此，无论你在全国什么地方，如果你的总理规定在当地餐馆或健身房或其他非必要场所出入的每个人都必须全面接种疫苗并出示证明，我们将支付该计划的开发和推广。对非必要的企业进行疫苗强制接种是一个好主意。它能保证人们的安全, 鼓励每个人做正确的事情。它使我们的企业继续运行，并使我们的经济继续重建。

Speaker 8

And the web of lies of disinformation is beginning to unravel for all to see not now from the government’s response to the pandemic to our military leadership’s failures and critical points in between. We see an elaborate effort to create an America fueled with fear ignoring basic truths and accountability. The facts are catching up with them too fast to deflect. And so their old COVID lies and scaremongering, it’s all falling apart fast. Now first on the vaccine mandates. It’s now a proven fact that being vaccinated and boosted neither protect you from contracting the virus nor spreading it. And more shocking is the new data that the vaccinated are more likely to contract Omicron than the unvaccinated. Now a fantastic piece today in The Wall Street Journal correctly notes. One preprint study found that after 30 days, the Maderna and Pfizer vaccines no longer had any statistically significant positive effect against Omicron infection. And after 90 days, their effect went negative, ie vaccinated people were more susceptible to Omicron infection. And let’s not forget one of the most pernicious and damaging things that Fauci in the pharma crowd did was to downplay the effectiveness and durability of natural immunity from previous COVID exposure. This is the T and B cell immunity that endures long after antibodies have waned.

What do you say to people who say well, I had COVID Therefore I am immune from COVID.

从政府对大流行病的反应到我们的军事领导层的失败以及中间的关键点，谎言和虚假网络信息开始被揭开，让所有人都明白了，我们看到一项精心设计的尝试，以创造一个被恐惧所驱使的美国，而忽略了基本的事实和责任。事实正快速地追赶着他们，使他们无法改变原计划。因此，他们以前关于新冠病毒的谎言和恐吓，都在迅速崩溃。现在先说说疫苗的任务，现在已经证明的事实是，接种疫苗和加强疫苗既不能保护你不感染病毒，也不能保证不传播病毒。更令人震惊的是，新的数据显示，接种疫苗的人比未接种疫苗的人更有可能感染奥米克戎病毒。现在《华尔街日报》今天的一篇精彩文章指出，一项预印本研究发现：30天后，玛德纳和辉瑞公司的疫苗对奥米克戎感染不再有任何统计意义上的积极作用；而在90天后，它们的效果变成了负数，即接种疫苗的人更容易感染奥米克戎。我们不要忘记福奇在制药界所做的最有害和最具破坏性的事情之一，就是淡化以前接受新冠病毒自然免疫力的有效性和持久性的影响。这就是在抗体减弱后仍能长期存在的T和B细胞免疫力。
对于那些说 “我得过新冠，所以我对新冠有免疫力 “的人，你怎么看？

Speaker 7
The issue of if you’ve been infected, how long your protection last, we don’t have enough information of that to give a great deal of confidence.
如果你被感染了，保护能持续多长时间，我们没有足够的信息来显示出很大的信心。

Speaker 8
A new Imperial College analysis shows that past infection with common cold Coronavirus is just as asked, we said offers T cell protection against COVID-19. Now COVID-19 Of course is a particularly nasty version of a Coronavirus with the massive number of asymptomatic COVID infections in the US. We already had an enormous amount of natural immunity rolling around now forcing vaccines on people then denying them employment or access to public spaces is simply abusive. Frankly, it’s a crime against humanity. I said it before and I’m gonna say it again especially as it’s directed among our young people who have suffered the most from lockdowns and restrictions.
帝国理工学院的一项新的分析显示，过去感染普通感冒冠状病毒也一样被提及，我们说提供T细胞保护，防止新冠病毒。现在新冠当然是冠状病毒的一个特别讨厌的版本，在美国有大量的无症状病毒感染，我们已经有了大量的自然免疫力。 现在强行给人们注射疫苗，然后拒绝他们就业或进入公共场所，简直是虐待。坦率地说，这是对人类的犯罪，我以前说过，现在我还要说，特别是针对我们的年轻人，他们在封锁和限制中受到的伤害最大。

Speaker 36
natural immunity is the end of the pandemic. Remember, as we all become naturally immune COVID-19 is no longer a threat to our lives. And the failure of our governmental agencies to recognize natural immunity has basically created unnecessary suffering, unnecessary testing, unnecessary masking and social distancing. Unnecessary compliance with all kinds of measures that are designed for the susceptible, those who are naturally immune are no longer susceptible to fatal disease.
自然免疫力是大流行病的终结者。记住，当我们都有自然免疫力的时候，新冠病毒就不再对我们的生命有威胁。而我们的政府机构对认识自然免疫力是失败的。基本上造成了不必要的痛苦、不必要的测试、不必要的口罩遮掩盖和社交距离，不必要地遵守各种为易感者设计的措施，那些具有自然免疫力的人不再容易受到致命疾病的影响。

Speaker 31 original version
We have a substantial data showing that we saw, for example, miscarriage miscarriages increased by 300%. Over the five-year average almost. We saw most 300% increase in cancer over the five-year average. We saw this one’s amazing neurological, so neurological issues which would affect our pilots over 1,000% increase 1010 times that’s 10 times rate and obviously, that rose at 3000 per year at 2000 per year to 863,000. In one year. 928 2021. Project Salus Rekall weekly report project. Salus is a defense department Initiative, where they report and contract. They take all this data that doesn’t exist, supposedly, and they give it to the CDC. They’re watching these vaccines on that date. And around that date. I have numerous instances where Fauci in that entire crew was saying it’s a crisis than backs. It’s 99% unboxed in the hospital, in Project Salus in the weekly report. The DoD document says specifically 71% of new cases are in the full vaccine and 60% of hospitalizations are in the full backs. This is corruption at the highest level, we need investigations.
Corrected by Mary Hao partially, but after calculating, the figure is not correct.  So this paragraph, I got confused, and I leave it to you.  Sorry.  
We have substantial data showing that we saw, for example, miscarriage miscarriages increased by 300% over the five-year average almost. We saw most 300% increase in cancer over the five-year average. We saw this one’s amazing neurological, so neurological issues which would affect our pilots over 1,000% increase,1000, 10 times that’s 10 times rate and obviously, that rose 8300 per year, I am saying 8200 per year to 863,000  in one year, 928,2021. Project Salus Rekall weekly report project. Salus is a defense department Initiative, where they report and contract. They take all this data that doesn’t exist, supposedly, and they give it to the CDC. They’re watching these vaccines on that date. And around that date. I have numerous instances where Fauci in that entire crew was saying it’s a crisis than backs. It’s 99% unboxed in the hospital, in Project Salus in the weekly report. The DoD document says specifically 71% of new cases are in the fully vaccine and 60% of hospitalizations are in the fully backs. This is corruption at the highest level, we need investigations.

我们有大量的数据显示，例如，流产比近五年来平均数值增加了300%。我们看到癌症比近五年来的平均水平最多增加300%，我们看到神经系统近惊人的数据，所以神经系统的问题会以超过1000%的增长速度影响我们的飞行员，也就是10倍的速度。显然这在每年8300人的时候，从一年中从8200人升到863,000人，9282021萨鲁斯项目利高公司周报项目，萨鲁斯是根据国防部的倡议，他们作报告和签订合同，据说他们把所有这些不存在的数据交给疾病预防中心，他们在那一天观察这些疫苗。而在那个日期前后，我有无数的例子可以证明，包括福奇整个团队都说这是一个危机而不是后卫。在医院里，在萨鲁斯项目的周报中，它有99%的开箱率。国防部的文件具体说，71%的新病例责任完全在疫苗，60%的住院病人完全是后卫，这是最高级别的腐败，我们需要调查。

Speaker 37
There are so few facts in this business to rely upon. And so what I’ve done when I’ve been giving speeches on this matter, I’ve asked people this question 500 of the time. Would everyone please put up their hand if they know someone in your personal acquaintance? Who after COVID vaccination has had serious life-threatening events such as a heart attack or stroke or a pulmonary embolus, not just a sore arm and a headache. To my great surprise, on the first occasion, a third of the people there put up their hands. And I asked him to stand up and look around. So I repeated the same question other events and it was approximately the same percentage of people. This is what we have to rely upon in the absence of government statistics about these very, very serious matters. Informal, anecdote fall uncorroborated evidence when government should be doing that for us very aggressively and they’re not doing that.
在这个行业中，可以依靠的事实太少了。因此，当我就这个问题发表演讲时，我500多次问人们这个问题，谁在接种新冠疫苗后发生了严重的生命威胁事件，如心梗或中风或肺栓塞，而不仅仅是手臂酸痛和头痛，请大家举起手来。令我非常惊讶的是，第一次，在场三分之一的人都举起了手，而我要求他站起来看看周围。于是我在其他活动中重复了同样的问题，大约是同样比例的人。在没有政府关于这些非常、非常严重的问题的统计数据的情况下，这就是我们必须依赖的、非正式的、轶事性的、未经证实的证据。而政府本来应该非常积极地为我们做这些，但他们却没有这样做。

So unvaccinated people may theoretically be in danger of getting sick from COVID. Everybody’s got to make that determination personally based on your age and your health. But the unvaccinated pose precisely zero danger to anyone who has been vaccinated. None. Let’s repeat that because it’s the central point here and it’s almost never made. If you are vaccinated against COVID-19. You face no conceivable danger whatsoever from people who have not been vaccinated. unvaccinated people cannot hurt you. So come down. That’s the science. And if you don’t believe the science, then you have instead embraced witchcraft and superstition. Please get a grip and excuse yourself from any conversation about public policy because you are too irrational to contribute to it.
因此，未接种疫苗的人理论上可能会有感染新冠病毒的危险。每个人都必须根据自己的年龄和健康状况来做出判断。但未接种疫苗的人对已接种疫苗的人构成的危险恰恰是零，没有危险。让我们重复这一点，因为它是这里的核心要点，而且几乎从来没有人提出过。如果你接种了新冠病毒的疫苗，你就不会面临来自未接种疫苗者的任何可以想象的危险。未接种疫苗者不会伤害你，所以平静下来，这就是科学。如果你不相信这些科学，那么你就是信奉了巫术和迷信。因为你太不理智了，以致无法发表正确的意见，请控制一下自己的情绪，并原谅自己在任何有关公共政策对话中的表现。
