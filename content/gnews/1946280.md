Brian Rose asks Dr Peter McCullough, why governments banned the use of Covid 19 treatments such as Hydroxychloroquine? So, what do you all think? Was it really necessary for government authorities to ban Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine?

【Brian Rose问Dr. Peter McCullough，为什么[[zh:政府]]禁止使用COVID-19治疗方法，比如[[zh:羟氯喹]]？

那么，大家怎么看？[[zh:政府]]当局是否真的有必要禁止使用[[zh:伊维菌素]]和[[zh:羟氯喹]]？

推文引用视频的英文原文如下：

**Brian Rose:** You said that you were in touch with a lot of the doctors in Italy, and you all came up with, you know, a protocol that people could use right away on treating the disease. You came up with these, you know, basics, you call them kind of off-label. And then that was kind of silenced and quelled right after that.

**Dr Peter McCullough:** It's true. You know the 2018 FDA guidance said doctors should use drugs off their original advertising labels when they are fulfilling an unmet medical need. That's exactly what we were doing with Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, Colchicine, Doxycycline, Azithromycin, Budesonide, Prednisone, and Enoxaparin. And that's how we treat Covid, and that's exactly what we were doing.

But there were certain drugs that were lightning rods, and the first one was hydroxychloroquine, where there was a crushing response that no one should receive hydroxychloroquine. I mean it was extraordinary. Do you know that billionaire Clive Palmer in Australia procured an entire supply of hydroxychloroquine for the whole population of Australia? The governmental authorities seized it and destroyed it.

**Brian Rose:** And why were they targeting that? Because if it was proven to be useful, then there would be no vaccine mandate.

**Dr Peter McCullough:** It's hard to ascribe motive, but why not just let people use hydroxychloroquine? If government authorities or other doctors didn't think it would work, Why would anybody care? Would anybody care about ivermectin, got a safety profile better than the seed of benefit, if it didn't work, but you know, we wanted to give it a try, and people were willing to pay for it.

Why would anyone care? What happened what we found is that the government and what we described in my book "Courage to Face Covid-19" is a biopharmaceutical complex, a very, very powerful syndicate is formed. That this biopharmaceutical complex had a single objective, and that was worldwide mass vaccination. Anything that got in its way was crushed.

推文引用视频的中文大意如下：

**Brian Rose:** 你说过你和[[zh:意大利]]的许多医生有过联系，然后你们提出了一种治疗方案，可以立刻用于治疗这种疾病。你们提出了这些，你知道的，基本的东西，你称它们为离标用药。然后，这在那之后被压制和镇压了。

**Dr. Peter McCullough:** 这是真的。你知道，2018年FDA的指南说，医生在满足未满足的医疗需求时应该使用药物，而不是原始广告标签上的药物。这正是我们使用[[zh:羟氯喹]]、[[zh:伊维菌素]]、科尔西辛、[[zh:多西]]环素、[[zh:阿奇霉素]]、布地奈德、强的松和依诺肝素所做的。这就是我们治疗Covid的方式，这也是我们一直在做的。

但有一些药物成为了[[zh:争议]]焦点，第一个是[[zh:羟氯喹]]，那里出现了强烈的反应，认为没有人应该服用[[zh:羟氯喹]]。我是说，这真是不可思议。你知道[[zh:澳大利亚]]的亿万富翁克莱夫·帕尔默曾为整个[[zh:澳大利亚]]人民采购了一整批[[zh:羟氯喹]]？[[zh:政府]]当局没收并销毁了它。

**Brian Rose:** 他们为什么要针对它呢？因为如果它被证明有用，那么就不需要[[zh:疫苗]]强制接种。

**Dr. Peter McCullough:** 很难断定动机，但为什么不让人们使用[[zh:羟氯喹]]呢？如果[[zh:政府]]当局或其他医生认为它不会起作用，为什么会有人在意呢？如果[[zh:伊维菌素]]没有起作用，为什么会有人在意，它的安全性好于益处？如果它不起作用，但你知道，我们想尝试一下，人们愿意为此付费。

有谁会在乎发生了什么？我们发现[[zh:政府]]和我们在我的书《面对Covid-19的[[zh:勇气]]》中所描述的是一个[[zh:生物]][[zh:制药]]综合体，形成了一个非常非常强大的集团。这个[[zh:生物]][[zh:制药]]综合体有一个单一的目标，那就是全球大规模[[zh:疫苗]]接种。任何妨碍它的东西都会被摧毁。
