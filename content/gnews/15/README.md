刚才你们做这PPT
Earlier when you were presenting the PPT

我看到群里在讲，什么叫通胀，什么叫通滞
I saw that the group was asking what inflation and deflation is

简单今天可以说
I’ll explain it by simplifying it today

形容大家最能听得懂的话
through describing what everyone can understand the most

就是本来这个人
Let say a person

这个经济不行
says this economy doesn’t work

但是它错误的用了一招
but he made a mistake

就打了疫苗
which was getting vaccinated

还打了5针、10针疫苗
and took 5 doses, even 10 doses

由于疫苗打太多，造成眼梗、脑梗、心梗
because of too many vaccines result in an ocular infarction, cerebral infarction, and myocardial infarction

这就是美国和世界的经济
and this is the US and the world’s economy

形容的很准确吧
This describing is very accurate, correct?

就是美国给这个本来
At first place, the US originally

不应该（打疫苗）的人打了是5针、10针的疫苗
shouldn’t have people vaccinated but the have taken 5 or even 10 doses already

就造成脑梗、心梗、眼梗
resulting in cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, or ocular infarction

所以美国叫滞胀、通胀、通缩并发
Therefore, the US is having a concurrency of stagflation, inflation, and deflation

就是社会的货币M2印的太多导致不流通
That is because too much money was printed, M2 flooding leads to liquidity problems

为什么呢
Why?

我想买面包，面包贵了
I want to buy bread, but the bread turns expensive

结果我不想买房子，房子可能便宜了
If I don’t want to buy a house, the house may be cheaper

我不想买汽车，可能汽车便宜了
I don’t want to buy a car, but maybe the car is cheaper

我想买汽车可能汽车贵了
And when I want to buy a car, maybe the car turns expensive

就完全是非需要和需要产品、生活用品、轻工业用品和重工业产品
All these non-needed or needed products, daily necessities, light or heavy industrial products,

还有供应链完全是就像你打了疫苗一样
and the supply chain is exactly like someone who has been COVID-19 vaccinated

到处梗到处阻
clogging everywhere

它就通胀通缩呀
it’s inflation or deflation

该给的不给，该要的不要
What should be given are not given, and what should be taken are not needed

该堵的全堵了
What should be blocked are all clogged

而且全世界性的
and it’s worldwide

人类上从来没想像今天全人类并发了一种症
We have never imagined that all human beings are suffering from one kind of disease today

个人身体叫做疫苗灾难
For individuals, it’s a vaccine disaster

各种病、各种梗、心包炎、心肌炎
It has various diseases, various infarctions, pericarditis, myocarditis

经济一模一样
The economy is exactly the same

简称通胀通缩
simply called inflation or deflation
