4月15日，法治基金/新中国联邦梅迪卡前线救援义工团队热烈欢迎从乌克兰逃出的彭大哥及其太太伊拉的加入，

On April 15, the Rule of Law Foundation/NFSC Relief Volunteer Team warmly welcomed Brother Peng and his wife Ila to join us at the Medyca Frontline, who had escaped from Ukraine,

夫妻俩都会讲乌克兰语、俄语和汉语，且会讲一点法语，他们的加入对我们整个义工团队在梅迪卡的救援活动来说可谓是锦上添花。

The couple, who both speak Ukrainian, Russian and Chinese, and a little French, were a great icing on the cake to our entire volunteer team in Medyca.

彭大哥已离开中共国30多年了，早已在乌克兰结婚成家生子立业了，眼睁睁看着自己苦心经营的家园被俄军彻底摧毁的心情是无比难过的。

Brother Peng has been away from Communist China for more than 30 years and has long since married and had a family and a business in Ukraine. It is incredibly sad to watch his hard-earned home being completely destroyed by the Russian army.

他们夫妻俩在战火中背井离乡，一路奔波让他们身心疲惫。

The couple had been uprooted from their home in the midst of the war and the journey had left them physically and mentally exhausted.

令人痛心的是其太太因一路惊恐，吃不下、睡不安明显消瘦，脸都脱了相。

It is distressing that his wife had lost a lot of weight and with sunken cheeks as she was unable to eat or sleep well due to the shock of the journey.

家里的5间房子都被俄军炸毁，养了3年的猫咪也没能带出来，他们为此伤心不已。

The family was devastated by the fact that all five of their houses had been bombed by the Russians and the cats they had kept for three years had not been brought out.

他们的儿子是瑞士国际象棋国家队成员，女儿在丹麦参与对乌克兰的人道救援，他们此行是准备去瑞士的儿子家避难。

Their son is a member of the Swiss chess national team and their daughter is involved in humanitarian aid to the Ukraine in Denmark, and their trip was to take refuge in their son’s home in Switzerland.

夫妻俩在遇到法治基金/新中国联邦的同胞义工，尤其是得知战友们是推翻中共的新中国联邦人时特别感动，因此决定不去瑞士的儿子家了，愿意留下来跟前线的兄弟姐妹们并肩作战共同帮助乌克兰难民。

The couple was particularly moved when they met compatriot volunteers from the Rule of Law Foundation/NFSC, especially when they learned that our fellow fighters were from the NFSC who committed to overthrowing the CCP, so they decided not to go to their son’s home in Switzerland, but to stay and work alongside our brothers and sisters on the front line to help the Ukrainian refugees.

【GETTR】Mr. and Mrs. Peng, who had no family under the war, were thrilled and touched by the opportunity to join the NFSC and become part of our fellow fighters, thanks to the great platform of the Rule of Law Foundation/NFSC that is saving more and more of our compatriots, which is why Miles Guo started the Whistleblower Movement in the first place!
