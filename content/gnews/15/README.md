1. Russia-Ukraine war aggravates world food crisis and inflation.


Let’s look at a set of data: Russia accounts for 11.3% of the global crude oil export, 16.2% of global natural gas export, 26% of global wheat export, 20% of global corn export, the first of nitrogen fertilizer export, the second of tin fertilizer export, the third of phosphate fertilizer export, 49% of global nickel export, and 42% of global palladium exports.

The EU depends on Russia the most worldwide. Ukraine is an important breadbasket for the world, but now due to the war between Russia and Ukraine, the following week is supposed be the time to plant crops in Ukraine, and if the timing of sowing is lost this week, the harvests will be greatly impacted, however, under the current war situation, it is obvious that no one will still go to sow, which means there will be a big shortage of food next year.

Agricultural fertilizers come from oil, and now Russia is at war with Ukraine, which will certainly lead to a big increase in the price of oil, and once the price of oil goes up, the price of fertilizers will go up, and then the price of food will go up. Therefore, the world food crisis is coming soon.

China relies on importing about 30 to 40 percent of food every year, and now the foreign exchange is declining and food price is also rising. Will China be able to import enough food then? I wonder how many Chinese people will suffer from starvation during the coming food crisis.

2. Vaccine dominoes begin to fall.

The FDA lost the case in Texas and Pfizer was forced to disclose the data of vaccine: 46,000 people had participated in the experimental study, among whom 42,000 people (91.30%) had adverse reactions, and 1,200 people (2.61%) died, the percentage of which is higher than that of the global mortality rate of the Covid-19.

At the same time, the side effects listed in the document are written for nine full pages. There are more than 1,000 adverse reactions listed in the currently disclosed documents, many of which are seen for the first time, including: fasciitis, eye swelling, facial paralysis, baldness, anaphylaxis, allergic reaction syndrome in pregnancy, acute cardiomyopathy, acute respiratory failure, injection site vasculitis, seizures, blood clots, arrhythmia, arthritis, asthma, bronchospasm, cardiac arrest, heart failure, chest discomfort, asphyxia, acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, acute encephalomyelitis, acute kidney injury, acute macular outer retinopathy, aplastic anemia, chronic autoimmune glomerulonephritis, chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, chronic spontaneous urticaria, hemolytic anemia, colitis, dermatitis, diabetes mellitus, embolic cerebral infarction, endocrine disorders, neonatal myasthenia gravis Myelitis, non-infectious ovarian inflammation, thyroiditis, ulcerative proctitis, ocular pruritus, genital herpes, glossopharyngeal nerve palsy, hemorrhagic vasculitis, cervicitis, lupus cystitis, lupus encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, etc.

FDA regulates that if one case of death happens within 30 days after an experimental trial drug is given to the testees, the experiment should be ended. But this time the experiment had not been stopped. Why?

3. Australian health officials now admit that people vaccinated by the COVID-19 vaccines are now dying from myocarditis. Shane Warne, the famous cricket legend star, passed away suddenly at the age of 53 from a suspected heart attack.
