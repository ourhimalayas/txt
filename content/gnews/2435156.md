以下为引用视频的全英文纪要：

**Elizabeth:** So, anyway, why have they put aluminum, let's get back to Gardasil, why have they put aluminum in the shot at all, what's aluminum's function do you think?

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Aluminum, basically, what it does is it aggravates the immune system. It causes an immune stimulus, and so it sort of magnifies the immune response. But it magnifies what's called a nonspecific immune response. So, the nonspecific immune response, it's sort of like an atomic bomb just kind of going off in the immune system. And they use aluminum sulfate, aluminum phosphate, and now this amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate.

You know, which had never been tested really alone prior to the Gardasil trial, but it aggravates the immune system. It causes activation of the innate immune system that will also initiate what are called B cells. And so it can magnify the level of immunity. When you put, you know, like an antigen like the HPV antigen goes in there, then it sort of, it's like a magnifying glass. It draws attention to that new antigen that's been introduced.

And a lot of vaccines, the hepatitis B vaccine has, you know, given the first day of life in the United States, has aluminum in it. You know, a lot of the, I believe that the Hib, the DTaP, and the MMRV all have aluminum in them now. So, you know, babies get a big wallop on the first day of life, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and then again at 15 months of aluminum.

**Elizabeth:** Yeah. So, just to clarify if people didn't understand what he's saying, the way I like to put it, and correct me if I'm wrong, is what they're trying to do with this vaccine is they're trying to copy. They want the immune system to respond the way they would have responded if the actual virus had come in. But because it's not a virus, it's just an antigen, they've used the aluminum to say, "Wake up, immune system, respond, here's danger."

And then that way, the antibodies get made because that's what they're doing.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** It just draws a magnifying glass onto the antigen as if the virus itself.

**Elizabeth:** Yeah, because it's not a real virus that they're injecting you with, right?

**Dr Brian Hooker:** No, no, not in the case of aluminum vaccines, correct.

**Elizabeth:** Yeah, there are other stories. Yeah, so that's what they're doing. And that's, and so obviously for a successful vaccine, what we really need, if we want to give children vaccines for certain illnesses, we need an adjuvant that's called an adjuvant. That thing that is safe, right? And it needs to be proven safe in an independent trial on its own compared to saline without the vaccine. You need to be able to just inject it and see what happens.

And I mean, I know other smaller scientists have worked. We've got an Australian scientist is working on an adjuvant. I forgot what it's made of, I think something to do with moths. But there are people out there trying to find adjuvants that are safer than aluminum, right?

**Dr Brian Hooker:** There are. There's a quest for adjuvants that are safer than aluminum. Aluminum has no physiological function. It just doesn't belong in the body in the first place. And there are other adjuvants that are currently in use. The Prevnar vaccine has what's called diphtheria toxoid CRM 197. And 197 was in a Hib vaccine that got pulled off the market in 2007. And, you know, just kind of mysteriously, all of a sudden, it was just disappeared from the market. No peep, no reason why, it just, they just pulled this vaccine off of the market. But yet they're using the same adjuvant now in Prevnar.

And so you know to me, we've got some preliminary results on the Prevnar versus the Pneumovax vaccine, we're seeing super big problems with the Prevnar vaccine, and so you know these, it's very difficult to modulate the immune system without having some unintended consequences.

**Elizabeth:** Just as a matter of interest, the Prevnar vaccine, so that Prevnar vaccine is for which illness? It's one of those respiratory ones, which one is it again? I've forgotten the name.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Pneumococcal pneumonia.

**Elizabeth:** Pneumococcal pneumonia. So I mean, which is nasty, which is a nasty disease, right?

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Right, right.

**Elizabeth:** You know, that's certainly a lot more serious than the flu and more serious really, frankly than COVID for children. When they ran that trial, I don't know if you know the answer to this, but when they ran that trial on the Prevnar, when they were first making it, what was in the placebo arm for that one?

**Dr Brian Hooker:** What they did is they progressively, I don't know what was in the placebo arm of the original Prevnar, but they, you know Prevnar went from Prevnar 7 to Prevnar 20, and which I believe is the current version of the market, and when they tested Prevnar 20, I believe that the control was Prevnar 7.

**Elizabeth:** Same story, okay.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Same story, same thing that they did with Gardasil is you just use another vaccine. I've seen vaccine trials with the flu shot in pregnancy where the control was the meningococcal meningitis vaccine, which is never given to pregnant women, you know, some of these preposterous control groups, that you know, would not — again, they make it so your control comparison is up here with this level of adverse events. So if you get more, then it's not against a saline placebo that would be down here, and so it's easier to approve vaccines that have dubious safety profiles.

**Elizabeth:** Yeah, that's just really bad science, it's shocking science. Just as a general comment for anyone who has got small children or about who was pregnant and about to have a child, when I had my children, there wasn't a book like this. And this is actually ordered listing the different vaccines and the different chapters so you can check before your child's vaccinated.

You know, when a heads up when your child's in hospital with you, they're gonna try and give your child a vitamin K and Hib B shot right away. You're not gonna have much time to get ready, so I would recommend that pregnant women and young moms read this book, right? And get an education on what's going on before a jab. I was thinking about this this morning, because you know, I've got two children. It was a long time ago that I had my babies.

You know, after you have your baby, I mean, you're a man, Brian, you don't know what this is like, or maybe you remember, but when you're in hospital, you just had your baby, a lot of us injured ourselves, us mums. I was injured, certainly, baby was injured, baby had a hard time, I had a hard time. Last thing I was doing was looking into vaccines, right? And no one, nobody brought the subject up with me while I was pregnant, no doctor, it wasn't in our classes that we did about giving birth, so I was completely blindsided when a nurse came around with a big needle to inject my baby with the Hib V and the vitamin K, and I was in no state to do my homework.

And of course, the baby was injected, so the better time to do this homework is before you have that baby, and that's why this book is invaluable. And I really like the way you did the chapters per vaccine so you can go and look at each one, and you put the whole schedule at the beginning too.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Right. Right, it's, again, and I have to echo that recommendation, we really want the book to be user-friendly and just really break down the facts, you know, regarding when you look at unvaccinated children versus vaccinated children, unvaccinated adults versus vaccinated adults, what is the difference for each vaccine that is featured in the book, and you know, real eye-catching graphics, you know, my wife made sure that the graphics match the book cover.

I mean, we were, we were, it was, it was like, it was like picking out, you know, interior design one night at my house trying to match up all the graphic colors, but we really, you know, and this was really Bobby's formula to make it as user-friendly as possible, it's not a hard read, and it's something that I believe that should be compulsory reading for new parents.

**Elizabeth:** Yeah, yeah, before that baby is born, before that baby is not good

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Because you will get him bombarded with a bunch of propaganda just as soon as they're born and even before, there is a chapter on prenatal vaccines as well.

**Elizabeth:** Oh, well, see we don't do that here. I was pregnant so I had no idea. It wasn't until COVID that I found out that American women were getting their flu shots and then the COVID shots while pregnant. I was so shocked we weren't doing that here. Now I found out from moms, young moms now this they are doing it here. I don't even, I can't even begin to comment. You know we're told we can't have brie cheese while we're pregnant and we can't have coffee and we can't have any alcohol, and here we go with an experimental injection into the arm, you know, it makes no sense. It makes no sense really. And I think, I mean I think they're told it's better for the baby because then the baby's equipped as soon as the baby comes out and just.

以下为引用视频的中文大意：

**Elizabeth:** 所以，无论如何，让我们回到Gardasil[[zh:疫苗]]，他们为什么要在[[zh:疫苗]]中加入铝呢，你认为铝的功能是什么？

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 基本上，铝的作用是激活[[zh:免疫系统]]。它引发了一种免疫刺激，所以它在某种程度上放大了[[zh:免疫反应]]。但它放大的是所谓的非特异性[[zh:免疫反应]]。所以，非特异性[[zh:免疫反应]]有点像[[zh:免疫系统]]中突发的[[zh:原子弹]]。他们使用的是硫酸铝、磷酸铝，现在还有这种非晶态的羟磷酸铝硫酸盐。

你知道，这在Gardasil试验之前从来没有真正被单独测试过，但它激活了[[zh:免疫系统]]。它引发了先天[[zh:免疫系统]]的激活，也会启动所谓的B细胞。因此，它可以放大免疫水平。当你放入像HPV[[zh:抗原]]这样的[[zh:抗原]]时，它就像放大镜一样，它吸引了对这种新引入的[[zh:抗原]]的关注。

许多[[zh:疫苗]]，像乙型肝炎[[zh:疫苗]]，在[[zh:美国]]新生儿出生的第一天就注射了铝。我相信百日咳、百日咳白喉联合[[zh:疫苗]]和[[zh:麻疹]]腮腺炎风疹四联[[zh:疫苗]]现在都含有铝。所以，你知道，婴儿会受到很大的冲击，在出生后的第一天，2个月，4个月，6个月，以及15个月都要接种大量的铝。

**Elizabeth:** 是的。所以，只是为了让听不懂他在说什么的人们加深理解，我喜欢这样解释，如果我理解错误，请纠正我，他们试图用这种[[zh:疫苗]]的方式来模仿。他们希望[[zh:免疫系统]]做出的反应与实际[[zh:病毒]]进入时的反应相同。但因为它不是[[zh:病毒]]，只是一个[[zh:抗原]]，所以他们使用铝来说，“[[zh:免疫系统]]，醒来，做出反应，这里有危险。”这样一来，[[zh:抗体]]就会产生，因为这就是他们在做的事情。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 它就像把放大镜对准[[zh:抗原]]，就好像对准了[[zh:病毒]]本身。

**Elizabeth:** 是的，因为他们注射给你的不是真正的[[zh:病毒]]，对吧？

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 是的，铝[[zh:疫苗]]的情况不是真正的[[zh:病毒]]，理解正确。

**Elizabeth:** 是的，还有其他故事。是的，这就是他们的做法。所以，显然，对于一种成功的[[zh:疫苗]]，如果我们想给孩子接种某些疾病的[[zh:疫苗]]，我们需要一种叫做[[zh:佐剂]]的[[zh:佐剂]]。那东西是安全的，对吧？它需要在独立的实验中证明其安全性，要与没有[[zh:疫苗]]的生理盐水进行比对试验。你需要能够只注射它，然后看看会发生什么。

我是说，我知道其他一些较小的[[zh:科学家]]已经在研究[[zh:佐剂]]了。我们有一位[[zh:澳大利亚]][[zh:科学家]]正在研究一种[[zh:佐剂]]。我忘了它是由什么制成的，我想与飞蛾有关。但是有人正在努力寻找比铝更安全的[[zh:佐剂]]，对吧？

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 确实有，有人正在寻找比铝更安全的[[zh:佐剂]]。铝在生理上没有功能，它根本就不应该存在于人体中，目前正在使用其他一些[[zh:佐剂]]。Prevnar[[zh:疫苗]]含有所谓的白喉毒素CRM 197，197成分曾经在2007年被撤下[[zh:市场]]的Hib[[zh:疫苗]]中使用过。然后，你知道，突然之间有点神神秘秘地，它就从[[zh:市场]]上消失了。没有声音，没有原因，他们只是将这种[[zh:疫苗]]从[[zh:市场]]上撤了。但是现在他们在Prevnar中使用相同的[[zh:佐剂]]。

因此，你知道，对我来说，我们对Prevnar与Pneumovax[[zh:疫苗]]进行了一些初步结果的研究，我们发现了Prevnar[[zh:疫苗]]的一些严重问题，所以你知道这些，很难调节[[zh:免疫系统]]而不会产生一些意想不到的后果。

**Elizabeth:** 纯粹出于兴趣，Prevnar[[zh:疫苗]]，那个Prevnar[[zh:疫苗]]是针对哪种疾病的？是其中一种呼吸道疾病，哪一个？我忘了名字。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 肺炎球菌肺炎。

**Elizabeth:** 肺炎球菌肺炎。所以，我的意思是，那是一种讨厌的疾病，对吧？

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 是的，对。

**Elizabeth:** 你知道，这显然比流感更严重，而且对于儿童来说确实比COVID更严重。当他们进行Prevnar的试验时，我不知道你知道答案吗，但是当他们第一次制作Prevnar时，对照组里有什么？

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 他们逐步做的。我不知道最初Prevnar的对照组中有什么，但是你知道，Prevnar从Prevnar 7变成了Prevnar 20，我相信这是目前[[zh:市场]]上的版本。当他们测试Prevnar 20时，我相信控制组是Prevnar 7。

**Elizabeth:** 同样的故事，明白了。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 同样的故事，就像他们在Gardasil中所做的一样，你只是使用另一种[[zh:疫苗]]。我看过孕期接种流感[[zh:疫苗]]的[[zh:疫苗]]试验，控制组是脑膜炎球菌脑膜炎[[zh:疫苗]]，这种[[zh:疫苗]]从不给孕妇接种，你知道，有些荒谬的对照组，你知道，不会——再说一遍，他们使得你的对照比较在这个不良[[zh:事件]]水平上。所以，如果出现更多的情况，那么与生理盐水安慰剂对照组相比，情况就不太一样了，这样就更容易批准安全性存疑的[[zh:疫苗]]。

**Elizabeth:** 是的，这只是真的很糟糕的[[zh:科学]]，令人震惊的[[zh:科学]]。对于任何有小孩或即将怀孕和要生孩子的人，我想发表一般性评论，当我生孩子时，没有像这样的书。实际上，这是按顺序列出不同[[zh:疫苗]]和不同章节的书，所以你可以在给孩子[[zh:接种疫苗]]之前检查。

你知道，当你的孩子和你一起在医院时，他们会立即给你的孩子注射维生素K和Hib B[[zh:疫苗]]。你不会有太多时间准备，所以我建议孕妇和年轻妈妈们读这本书，对吧？并且在注射之前了解正在发生的事情。今天早上我想到了这个问题，因为你知道，我有两个孩子。我生孩子已经很久了。

你知道，生完孩子后，我是说，你是个男人，布莱恩，你不知道这是什么感觉，或者也许你记得，但当你在医院时，刚生完孩子，我们很多人都受伤了，我们妈妈们。我受伤了，当然，孩子也受伤了，孩子过得很辛苦，我也过得很辛苦。我最后做的事情就是研究[[zh:疫苗]]，对吧？而且没有人，在我怀孕期间，没有医生提出这个话题，我们[[zh:关于]]分娩的课程中也没有提到，所以当护士拿着大针来给我的孩子注射Hib V和维生素K时，我完全不知情，我当时没有心思去做功课。

当然，孩子被注射了，所以最好在生孩子之前做这项功课，这就是为什么这本书是无价的。我真的很喜欢你为每种[[zh:疫苗]]分章节的方式，这样你就可以查看每一种，而且你还在开头列出了整个接种计划。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 对，对，再强调一次，我不得不附和这一建议，我们真的希望这本书能够对读者友好，并真正解释事实，你知道，当你看未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的孩子与[[zh:接种疫苗]]的孩子、未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的成年人与[[zh:接种疫苗]]的成年人时，书中每种[[zh:疫苗]]的差异是什么，你知道，真正引人注目的图形，你知道，我的妻子确保图形与书的封面相匹配。

我是说，我们，我们，就像在我家的一个晚上挑选室内设计一样，试图将所有图形颜色匹配起来，但我们真的，你知道，这实际上是鲍比的设计，使其尽可能地方便用户，这不是一本难以阅读的书，这是一本我相信应该是新生儿父母们的必读书。

**Elizabeth:** 是的，是的，在孩子出生之前，在孩子还不好的时候。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 因为他们刚出生甚至在出生前的时候，你会受到大量的宣传轰炸，这本书也有一章介绍产前[[zh:疫苗]]。

**Elizabeth:** 哦，嗯，我们这里不这样做。我当时怀孕了，所以我一点都不知情。直到[[zh:新冠]][[zh:疫情]]爆发，我才发现[[zh:美国]]妇女在接种流感[[zh:疫苗]]，然后在怀孕期间再接种[[zh:新冠]][[zh:疫苗]]。我对我们这里没有这样做感到非常震惊。现在我从妈妈们那里了解到，现在年轻的妈妈们在这里也这样做。我甚至无法评论。你知道，我们被告知怀孕期间不能吃布里奶酪，不能喝咖啡，不能喝酒，然后我们又在注射试验性药物，你知道，这毫无道理。这真的毫无道理。我认为，我认为他们被告知这样做对宝宝更好，因为宝宝一出生就有准备了，就是这样。
