As per the report from CBC, on October 21, 2021 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada will receive enough vaccine doses from Pfizer to allow all children aged 5 to 11 to get a first dose shortly after Health Canada approves it for that age group. Trudeau also urged parents to be patient while waiting for Health Canada to review the vaccine.

Since the announcement from the Prime Minister , on Oct 26, 2021, CBC also reports that Saskatchewan hopes to receive its first shipment of an expected total of 112,000 vaccine doses meant for kids aged 5 to 11 in early- to mid-November, according to the province’s medical health officer responsible for immunization.

On the same day, CBC reports that A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee has voted in favour of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old.

**Comments:**

It appears that the tide has turned in Europe, where the vaccine mandate has been abolished in many countries. However on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, the Canadian government is continuing with the vaccine mandate and has now pushed their agenda toward the innocent children. One can only describe their actions as pure evil and insane.

Canada is so far one of the most vaccinated countries in the world. As of Oct 28, 2021, according to the website of the government of Canada, 82.76% of the population are fully vaccinated and 87.66% have received at least one dose.  Miles Guo, the leader of the Whistle Blower Movement has recently indicated that the Jews and the Canadians are among the people that will likely suffer the most from the vaccine mandate.

Unfortunately, most of the Canadian parents still don’t realize how dangerous the vaccine truly is. A lot of them not only have taken the shots themselves, they are also looking forward to vaccinating their children so that they could return to a so called normal life. The only result of vaccinating children will be the destruction of these young lives.

Over the past decade, I have personally known and made friends with a lot of Canadians, who have lived in a peaceful environment all their lives, who believe in science, technology and kindness of human heart, who are gentle and polite towards each other, and whose well-being I am deeply concerned about. However when I try to share the position of the Whistle Blower Movement concerning the pandemic and the vaccines, a common response I receive is: “Oh, it cannot be that bad!” Or, “Oh it just cannot be like that”. To my Canadian friends who don’t know about the evilness of CCP, I want to say: Yes, it is that bad, and probably thousand times worse than what you can imagine.

Now the knife of CCP in terms of global vaccination is already against everyone’s throat, and they would not spare children. It is a life and death situation. Please spread the truth about the virus and vaccine with your friends and family, which will give the children a chance to survive this global genocide.
