**This documentary **is reported to be true. The author is Laofu, the former director of the Social Security Center of Xi’an Bureau, and a former train section chief.
Recently, in Fengxian County, Xuzhou, the Eight-Child Incident became a hot topic on the Internet worldwide. It reminded me of the incident in a station near Xuzhou 30 years ago when local villagers robbed and sold a young female who was a post graduate student. At that time, I was working in the train fleet from Baoji to Lianyungang.

Mrs. Hou, who was the director of the station accompanied me to speak in the soft-seat waiting room. We were talking happily when we heard a commotion outside the door. Director Hou frowned and stood up and muttered, “Here again”. He turned to me and said, “Sorry, I’ll deal with it first.” I came out too.
On the platform outside the door, there was a dark crowd of peasants. Some of them were holding hoes and shovels. Another was carrying a pig-killing knife and wearing a bloody rubber apron. He came here directly from pig slaughter house. 
Director Hou roared furiously at Xiao Wang who was a stuff checking the ticket, why did so many people come in? Xiao Wang said with a look of grievance, “These people said they belonged to your village and rushed in directly from the entrance.” 
Director Hou shunted aside the crowd and came to the middle. A young woman sat on the ground held by a middle-aged woman wearing glasses. She was about to ask what was happening,  a strong man clapped her and asked “What are you looking at? Third, are you still in charge at the station?  Mao Dan’s woman was abducted!”
Director Hou raised her head blankly and asked “Brother Ji, who abducted her?
”It’s them. Brother.” Ji pointed to the two police officers in front of him, and a gentle man in a cap.
Director Hou asked the two police officers, “Who are you?”
The policeman took a step forward and said,”We are police officers from Shanghai. These two are professors, Mr. Mo and Mrs. Wu came from the Institute of Chemistry, Shanghai. Their daughter Mo Hua, a graduate student, came here for her research project five years ago, and was kidnapped. We are here to rescue her.” Saying that, he took out his documents and asked, are you the person who are in charge here?”
Director Hou said , “I am not the person who is in charge here. The people who are in charge here went to committee for a meeting today, and I am substitutes for them.” 
“Well, please help us to rescue the abducted and trafficked women.”
“Okay, I get it now.” Director Hou took a deep breath.

Later, she told me that she knew what was going on as soon as she came in. This often happens here.  The kidnapped girl called her sister-in-law. When she went home, her family talked about the girl but they didn’t know the girl was a graduate student with a master’s degree. 
Director Hou asked Xiao Wang to call the chief police at station to bring a few more people. She was afraid that people might fight on the platform. If anyone got injured, it will be big trouble, and she would also be blamed. 
Director Hou arranged workers from the station to take the middle aged woman and the girl sitting on the ground to the passenger duty room. A middle-aged man with a big head, a thick neck, and a bald head rushed over, grabbed Director Hou and said, “Third, I’m going to go in and see my woman too, we paid money for her.” Director Hou hesitated, heard everyone shouting, “Rush in, don’t let her run away.” Director Hou sighed and said, “Don’t mess it up when you go in. The police have guns and they will shoot you if you make any trouble. Mao Dan hesitated for a moment and said, “I won’t give any trouble, I won’t !”  Mao Dan and Mao Dan’s mother followed suit. There were also a few strong men blocking the door.
She invited the two policemen, brother Ji, the village chief to the soft-seat waiting room. Talk about a solution. Let the others stand on the platform, a crowd of about one or two hundred people.
No one spoke at first, but Brother Ji broke the silence and shouted, “People can’t take her away.”
“Why?”
“Why, two of them have a marriage certificate, which is recognized by the government.” 
The police said, “Marriage is autonomous. Did she want to get married?”
“That doesn’t matter, they spent 800 yuan! If you take her away, who is going to pay the money back?”
The policeman squinted at brother Ji and said, “Spending 800 yuan is buying and selling women, which is a violation of the law.”
Brother Ji pouted, “We have a lot of things like this here, and we haven’t seen anyone say it’s illegal.”
The police said: “Just because you have so many things like this here, you can’t say that this thing is not against the law”.
Brother Ji said: “That money is a dowry, and now the whole country needs a dowry to marry a woman to be a wife. Is it illegal? If it is said to have violated the law, this woman has committed a crime”.
The police asked: ”what law did she break?”
Er Bang said: “She killed her two children with her own hands”.
What evidence do you have?
Evidence? Brother Ji snorted and said: “The first child died strangely, and everyone was puzzled. When the second child was born, the family was on guard. When she was suffocating the child to death that day, the family rushed in and snatched the child from her. The child was still having sign of life when they snatched the baby. They could not save the baby and it died in the Murakami clinic Later. She tried to commit suicide several times, and then she was tied up so that she wouldn’t die”.

After hearing this, the police officer said with a stunned expression, “We don’t know the situation you reported. We are now rescuing the abducted and trafficked women, and a special team will follow up and investigate. But people, today we have to take her away. Obstruction means obstructing public affairs, and it is a crime. Anyone who obstructs us will be arrested”. Although the two policemen in Shanghai have smooth skin, soft looking, their expressions are very determined and firm. 
The village chief couldn’t get on his way. He winked to their people, so everyone in the village followed him outside the door. Then he called Mao Dan and his mother. Murmured, chit chat for a while, then they went back into the room.
Everyone sat down again. The village chief stood up and said: “You are performing official duties, and it is not easy. As a first-level organization, we in Murakami should cooperate in principle, but you should also think about it for us. We have been poor since ancient times. People here they could not find wives, so they went to the countryside to find them. There are still more than 20 bachelors in their 30s and 40s in our village. Everyone is buying wives. If you don’t buy them, you won’t be able to have one. If you don’t buy them, you will die without offspring. This time, we Murakami cooperated with you and asked you to take people away, but the money spent by Mao Dan’s family should be returned. It will cost money to buy a woman.  Mao Dan needs money to buy a wife.  He is 42 this year. If you guys could not help to get a solution, then I won’t be able to help solve the problem”.

The police still wanted to negotiate, but Director Hou hurriedly pulled them out and said, “This may be the only way to take people away today. If you don’t give them money, they won’t let you leave today. You should discuss it with the girl’s family”.
The two policemen had no choice but to invite Professor Mo out. After hearing this, Professor Mo shivered with anger and sobbing, “My daughter has been ruined by them like this, she is dying, and they still extort us. That’s brutal, he cried out”. 
The two policemen scolded with guilt on their faces: “Fuck, there is no reason for them to do this”!
Director Hou hurriedly said: “ If you can’t leave today, the longer time you are here, the more dangerous it will be, and I don’t know what else will happen next”. Under the persuasion of everyone, Professor Mo thought about it again and again and agreed.
Director Hou called the village head, Mao Dan and his mother over to discuss the price. How much did they want? the police asked. Mao Dan said: “eight hundred, the mother said NO”, “THREE THOUSAND”. 
Why? Everyone was stunned.
“Because it costs 2,000 yuan to buy a daughter-in-law now. In addition, all these years at home, she only eats and does not work.  They have to pay one thousand more. 3,000 yuan, if there is one cent less, I will hold her and crash into a train to die in front of you all,” Mao Dan’s mother said savagely.
Professor Mo was trembling with anger, tears streaming down his face and said: “In order to find children these years, we have traveled all over the country and spent all our money. How could we have so much money now”?
At that time, my monthly salary was more than 100 yuan, and 3,000 yuan was a big figure.
The police asked quietly, “how much do you have now”? Professor Mo said: “ I have only 1,500 yuan.
Director Hou told the village chief about the situation. The village chief shook his head and said: “ I’m afraid it won’t work”. Director Hou asked him to persuade him again. It is best to resolve the matter through negotiation today. We backed out the door with the police and waited. They quarreled and then scolded inside. Finally, the village chief clapped the table and then calmed down. The village chief came out furiously and said: “No way, I can only talk about this step. Two thousand yuan, the meal is exempted.” They are still calling me a traitor and take your side. All right, you just grab the money. If not, I am not to be a mediator and I’ll leave”.
Everyone looked at each other.
As soon as Mao Dan heard that the money was not enough, he shouted to get ready to fight with them, since the people on the platform would rush into the room to grab the girl… I hurriedly asked Director Hou to pull the two policemen aside and said: “ this is not a reasonable place.  Let’s still gather some money”. Our car will come in a moment. Get in our car first, and get out of here quickly. I will find a way to borrow your travel expenses back in the car for you. If someone is robbed. It will be difficult to rescue”.

To be continued.
