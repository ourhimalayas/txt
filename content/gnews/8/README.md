Chairman Xi Jinping originally intended 57 nations to attend Winter Olympic that is to be held in Beijing. All but 3 of small nations will be boycotting the Winter Olympic. This signifies that China no longer enjoys good diplomatic relationship with the world. Xi is furious as he had spent too much time and effort to plan this Winter Olympic. New Federal state of China had contributed the most to make this boycott happen. To take revenge on United States for the boycott, Evergrande defaulted on interest rate payment, causing losses to US investment firms.

To break Mile’s spirit, CCP sent a few hundred special forces and policemen to Pangu hotel (Pangu hotel is owned by Miles). All hotel staff and customers including Mile/s 92 years old father were forced onto the street by these policemen. All the people who were driven out were not allowed to change into winter clothes during a time when the weather was freezing at -4 ℃. Those who showed even a slight hint of resist were beaten on the spot. These victims and some of their family members also had their mobile phone network cut off and credit cards deactivated, therefore removing their power to purchase and communication to get help.

Shan Weijian, chairperson of PAG, together with Bruno Wu began to launch various lawsuits on Mile’s companies. These lawsuits and Pangu hotel incident both happened concurrently, showing that these attacks are coordinated and pre-planned. The true identity of Shan Weijian is actually a China KGB groomed by the CCP.
