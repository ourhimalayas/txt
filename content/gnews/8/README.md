## 1.2. 疫苗 Vaccines

疫苗接种，最早始于中共国。

Vaccination first began in Communist China.

2020年2月，中共国陈薇将军，第一个接种疫苗。

2020年3月和4月，中国的科学界、医疗界、护士，开始接种疫苗。

2020年6月，中共的外交部，开始全部接种疫苗。

In February 2020, General Chen Wei of the Communist Party of China was the first to receive the vaccine.

In March and April 2020, China’s scientific community, the medical community, and nurses began the vaccination.

随后，中东开始接种疫苗，特别是阿联酋、沙特等国。

2021年1月，拜登进入白宫，辉瑞疫苗被认可，美国开始推进疫苗。

与此同时，西方各国也开始了全面推进疫苗的接种。

In June 2020, the Chinese Communist Party’s Foreign Ministry began all vaccinations.

Then, the Middle East begins vaccination, especially in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and other countries.

In January 2021, Biden entered the White House, the Pfizer vaccine was recognized, and the United States began to promote vaccines.

At the same time, Western countries also began a full vaccination push.

全球推进疫苗以来，西方国家，在推广之后，大约六十天内，病毒传染率极速下降，然后，突然间大幅度反弹，感染率和死亡率，同时大幅攀升。

2021年5、6月后，多种新型病毒，开始在全球大肆蔓延，疫苗接种开始了第二针和第三针。

Since the global advancement of the vaccine, Western countries, for about sixty days after the rollout, saw an extremely rapid decline in virus transmission rates, and then, suddenly, a significant rebound, with infection and death rates, simultaneously climbing dramatically.

After May and June 2021, a variety of new viruses began to spread globally, and vaccination began with the second and third doses.

2021年7、8月，于东京奥运会前后，日本疫苗普及率整体上升。死亡率，也紧随着直线上升。从冠状病毒肆虐至今，日本死亡率为最高。东京奥运会，成为了日本的灾难。日本每日死亡人数，约两千人左右。

2021年8月左右，以色列的大批民众开始接种第两针，甚至第三针，其死亡率和疫苗普及率，恰好相当，分别为百分之一百零七和百分之一百零八。

In July and August 2021, around the time of the Tokyo Olympics, the overall vaccine prevalence rate in Japan increased. The mortality rate, too, rose steeply. The death rate in Japan was the highest since the coronavirus attack. The Tokyo Olympics became a disaster for Japan. Japan’s daily death toll was about two thousand people.

Around August 2021, a large number of people in Israel began to receive their second and even third doses, and their mortality rates and vaccine prevalence rates were the same, at 107% and 108%, respectively.

值得注意的是，这段时间，无论是美国、英国、还是以色列，人们都处于隔离状态。人们的生存空间和活动空间，分别减少了百分之五十和百分之七十。然而，与此同时，病毒的感染率和死亡率，居然高于去年。

It is noteworthy that during this time, people were in isolation, whether in the United States, the United Kingdom, or Israel. People’s living space and activity space have been reduced by 50% and 70% respectively. Yet, at the same time, the infection and death rates of the virus are higher than last year.

美国的死亡率和疫苗普及率，呈等幅上升。感染人数，每天二十多万到三十多万，回到了2020年的最高峰，感染率居高不下。死亡率，连翻二倍到三倍，甚至更多。过去感染十万人，可能死亡一两千人，而现在的死亡人数，多达五六千人。

Mortality rates and vaccine prevalence in the United States, are increasing at equal rates. The number of infections, more than 200,000 to 300,000 per day, is back to its peak in 2020, with infection rates remaining high. The death rate even doubled to tripled, or more. Whereas in the past 100,000 people were infected, one or two thousand might die, the number of deaths now, as many as five or six thousand.

再看印度。在印度，羟氯喹、锌和伊维菌素，是被广泛使用的。病毒传播初期，印度的感染率和死亡率，保持很低。

然而，在什么时间点、又是怎样的情况下，印度的感染率和死亡率，急剧上升、出现大量死亡？这和疫苗有没有关系？有怎样的关系？

In India, hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and ivermectin are widely used. In the early stages of virus transmission, the infection and mortality rates in India remained very low.

However, at what point in time, and under what circumstances, did the infection and mortality rates in India, increase dramatically and a large number of deaths occurred? Does this have anything to do with the vaccine? How is it related?

印度开始大量死亡的时间点，恰恰是全国开始疫苗接种之时。其时间上，早于以色列。

印度最早购买的疫苗，来自俄罗斯，然后是从英国和中国进口疫苗，最后进口了美国疫苗。印度富人，则大多选择辉瑞疫苗。

而印度死亡人中，年轻人占很大比例。为什么要让年轻人接种疫苗？为什么印度这么多年轻人死亡？

The point at which India began to die in large numbers precisely with the start of vaccination across the country. Its timing was earlier than in Israel. The first vaccines purchased in India came from Russia, then were imported from the UK and China, and finally, the US vaccines were imported. The rich Indians, in turn, mostly chose Pfizer vaccines.

And a large percentage of the dead in India are young people. Why should young people be vaccinated? Why are so many young people dying from vaccination in India?

在台湾，人们习惯食用很多瓦萨比和芥末，加上当地的气候，其病毒控制，卓有成效。即使被多次暗中放毒，皆未造成蔓延。

但是，台湾政府，后来居然引进大陆疫苗，全民推进。这将给台湾人民带来不堪设想的后果。

In Taiwan, people are used to eating a lot of Wasabi and mustard, and with the local climate, the virus has been controlled with great success. Even though the coronavirus has been secretly released in Taiwan many times, it did not cause the spread.

However, the Taiwan government, later on, actually introduced the mainland vaccine and promoted it for all people. This will bring unimaginable consequences to the people of Taiwan.

中共国的感染人数和死亡人数皆低。是它治疗得法、还是谎报数字？

我们再问一句：仅仅是这么简单吗？

The number of infections and deaths in Communist China are both low. Did it treat them well, or did it lie about the numbers?

Again, we ask: Is it that simple?
