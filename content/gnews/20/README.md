谢谢七哥
Thank you, Brother Miles

有战友问，墙内战友如果被威胁的情况下把喜币转走的话，是否可以追回
A comrade asked if it is possible to recover the HCoins if they were transferred under threat in China mainland

这个问题
This question

100%可以追回
It can be 100% recovered

我再重申一遍
Let me reiterate

你们要看，一定要看白皮书，一定要看这些
You have to read, you have to read the white paper

我们所有说的话不代表喜联储，我们所有说的话不代表喜币
Everything we say does not represent the Himalaya Exchange and everything we say does not represent the Hcoin

而且大家也知道，喜币和GTV没有半毛钱关系
And as you all know, Hcoin has nothing to do with GTV

战友们只是喜币的拥有者
Comrades are only the owners of Hcoins

大部分投资者到目前为止
Most of the investors so far

是吧?我们不代表喜联储
Right? we can’t speak for the Himalaya Exchange

但是你们一定要记住，我们是（喜联储的）结构设计师，我们是创意的发起人
But you must remember that we are the ( Himalaya Exchange’s) structure designers, the originators of the idea

我告诉大家，喜币最牛的就是
Let me tell you, the most extraordinary about Hcoin is that

你即使被黑客掉，都被拿走了，拿枪顶着拿走了，都会给你拿回来
even though if your Hcoins were scammed and taken away, taken away at gunpoint, you will get them back

它就是区块链，它就是中心化的好处
It is the blockchain, and it is the benefit of centralization

就是你Sarah被人家给骗了，这个男朋友，是吧？
Let’s say Sarah was cheated by someone i.e. boyfriend, right?

Sarah这一激动，是吧？喝点酒男朋友把她手机拿走了，把币给拿走了
Sarah is happy, right? After drink, the boyfriend took her phone and took the coins

这Sarah绝对干的出来，所以说她币多了绝对不行
Sarah definitely would have done this, so it’s absolutely not good for her to have so many coins

被骗走了，报案了，是不是？现在我的币被某人骗走了，手机怎么回事
She was scammed and reported it to the police, right? Now her coins were taken by someone, her phone was stollen

不但是现在，永远都可能给你拿得回来
Not only now, I can always get it back for you

因为这个区垮链牛（的地方）就是，你不可藏匿你的行踪
Because the most extraordinary thing about this blockchain is that you can’t hide your whereabouts

你根本没交易，咋跑你手里去了
You didn’t make the trade at all, how would it get into your hands?

那到你手里去了，你俩啥关系啊？
It went to your account, what’s the relationship between you two?

既没交易，你俩也互不认识
No transaction, nor know each other

你转给老班长,说你看老班长，我们都是战友嘛，人家知道
Let say you transfer coins to the old squad leader, he is our comrade, and we know each other

你找给一个什么国内的李班长、王班长，那对不起了，这根本不认识他
But if you transfer them (Hcoins) to a squad leader Li or Wang who is located in China, then sorry, you don’t know him at all

肯定经过法律程序一定会拿回来，不用担心
No worries, you surely will get them back after the legal process

所以那个战友我就发信息，要啥给啥，别跟警察斗
That’s why I send a message to our comrades, do what they told you to, and don’t resist the police

因为你的币永远还是你的币
Because those are your coins and will always be your coins

但是有另外的战友就很聪明，人家就是设置好的，直接就报警
Another thing is that there are very smart comrades who have set up a direct alert

报警大家知道直接给你归零了，给你保管起来了
Everyone knows they should bring your account to Zero after alert sounds. They (the system) will keep it for you

回头再给你，是吧？
and give it back to you later, right?

这个是绝对安全，这是最无价的
This is absolutely safe, and this is the most priceless

就像付政华在我们那收走几个亿港币，几亿人民币
Just like the hundreds of millions of Hong Kong dollars and hundreds of millions of RMB that Fu Zhenghua took from us

是不是？几百斤金子他不还了，多愚蠢，是吧？
Right? Hundreds of cities of gold, you can’t get them back, how stupid, right?

你要有这币，你收走就收走，是吧？
But if you have the coins, they can take them if they want, right?

你收走最后一定拿回来
You’ll get them back in the end

好，谢谢
Okay, thank you
