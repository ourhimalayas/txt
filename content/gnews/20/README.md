苦女                     
The Suffering Women

可叹
Alas
少女无辜遭祸端
The innocent little girl became a victim of human trafficking
音信杳杳如纸鸢
 No one has heard from her ever since
二十 四载拘囚 骨肉离散
Twenty-four years of captivity, separated from her loving family
叫破苍穹 谁见薄命红颜 
Has anyone seen this poor girl? She has nowhere to turn for help

剪舌拔齿和血咽
They cut her tongue and pulled out her teeth
链锁玉颈双蛾残
Chained her delicate neck and destroyed her beautiful complexion
修罗场内不见天
In a hopeless plight and a world of darkness 
炼狱泯人寰
Her tragedy in that living hell is incomparable in this world

此生无日望生还
There is no hope for her to return to her joyful life
逃离恨海待何年
When will she be able to escape from the sea of misery? 
万念俱灰 肝肠痛断
With all hopes dashed to pieces, she is overwhelmed by grief
  
痴语问苍天 一叹泪涟涟
She asks the heaven why she has to suffer, heaven fell silent, only tears linger
可叹盛世谎弥天
What a horrendous tragedy, the so-called “prosperous China” is full of lies
 生如蝼蚁命难全
Human life means nothing in the eyes of the Chinese Communist Party
举国沉酣浑不觉
But the whole country is still asleep, without realizing what’s really happening
遭逢胜过《窦娥冤》
The injustice she has been suffering is even worse than the story of Snow in Midsummer

灵魂割礼实可哀
The mass mutilation of the souls is truly tragic
他日谁上断头台
Retribution for the wicked will surely come on Judgment Day
