【突发新闻：[[zh:新西兰]][[zh:国会议员]]呼吁对史无前例的过度[[zh:死亡率]]上升进行[[zh:刑事调查]]。 强烈建议听听她的整个信息。】

这一段推文所附视频对应的英文原文是：

I'm Liz Gunn, and welcome to this New Zealand loyal post-election update.

The first of two election updates. In my previous video just before the election went ahead, I stated that I would, straight after the election, release information that would shock you, the mother of all revelations, more. There were many demanding that the information be released before the election, but that was not able to be facilitated. The whistleblower's words to us were that it would be published after the election. I also had deep concerns around the trauma the information would cause on the Eve of the election, and to me, it felt unethical to exploit such traumatic information for our own political gain.

Well, we have now come to an undisclosed location with a New Zealand clinician-mathematician who is very experienced in statistical analysis. That person has, with us, reviewed the data and confirms our position that it is damning. The figures show that there are tens of thousands of deaths linked to the jabs, and this is just one of the sites recording this type of information in New Zealand. We don't know how many further databases like this are in the country, so it follows that as the deaths are usually less than the numbers of side effects, then the extrapolation of the numbers of injured and dead Kiwis starts to become frankly eyewatering.

We saw in the data that there are many clusters of deaths, people who attended the same jab site and were jabbed one after the other at consecutive times on the same day. We saw their jab date, we saw their date of death. Let me give you just one of many examples. On one day, 30 people were jabbed on the same day at the same location, all are now deceased, and their deaths are in close temporal time proximity to each other. That's 30, that's all players in a rugby match on the field, suddenly dead. You see statistically the numbers of deaths we saw cannot be attributed to natural causes, given the same site and the same date of vaccination. It would be, what they say, statistically highly unlikely.

We are calling for an inquiry, not just any inquiry, a full-blown criminal investigation leaving no stone unturned. New Zealand is a crime scene. Computers of anyone associated with this COVID response roll up in any capacity, mobile phones, communications, bank accounts, archives, and a whole host of other targeted information must be seized. We have OIA evidence, Official Information Act evidence that the government knew every side effect before one single jab was given in New Zealand, so this evidence lays waste to the safe and effective narrative. It also underlines the gravity and enormity of what I have just stated in this statement. The OIA evidence we have is attached underneath this post on the nzloyal.org.nz site.

But there's one thing for sure, there should be no more jabs administered in this country. So many lives have been lost. We saw 13 children on the list that we have examined alone, since this whistleblower approached me, saying they wanted me to release this once I was in parliament. I have wanted to have this data released immediately. Why? Because clearly, once it fully goes out to you the public, it would prevent any more loss of life. In fact, so committed am I to stopping any further murder by needle in this country that I was willing to put my face and my name on the line on the Eve of the election. I have seen the information firsthand. I have struggled sleeping at night since then, knowing that this level of detail is now available but as we find today being withheld. You see, whistleblowers always face great risk, as we all do who seek to bring the truth to the people of this country under urgency.

I cannot comprehend why when there is ongoing harm that this data is not released immediately to bring an end to that harm and to launch a full-blown criminal investigation. So, I'm appealing to you, the people of New Zealand. You must all demand an end to the jabs. If not addressed urgently, the World Health Organization will be able to declare the next pandemic and force mass jab compliance under the Pandemic Preparedness Act, which will soon be a reality.

Research that. It's also critical that you understand the difference between an inquiry per se, which is what Winston Peters has called for, and what we call for, a criminal investigation. Inquiries often lead to narrow terms of reference, and they can risk just being a whitewash where they seem to be doing something, but there's little or no change as a result. By contrast, criminal investigations involve seizure and an in-depth examination and exposure of all facts.

What I will do in New Zealand should this whistleblower finally find the drive that we are showing at New Zealand Loyal, the determination that we have, and approach me again and say they will divulge it all, what I will do is take that information to Winston Peters. I'm not looking for anything from this other than what I always look for, which is to serve my country. I will willingly offer it to Winston Peters should they find the courage to fully open up with what we have seen today, and I will hope that Winston gets along with the hard work of exposing it. I would hope that he gets all the glory as well. What I want more than anything is for these truths to be brought to you, the people of New Zealand.

And my final word today would be this: I pray that at last, the backbiting can stop, the nastiness, the undermining of one another can stop, and that this issue, this important, crucial standing together, finally unites us all New Zealand, and that we stand up to this new government and say we demand a full exposure of the truth.

这则推文所附视频对应的中文大意是：

我是莉兹·冈（Liz Gunn），欢迎来到这个[[zh:新西兰]]忠实的选举后更新，这是两次选举更新的第一部分。在选举前的上一个视频中，我表示我会在选举后立刻发布令你震惊的信息，这是所有启示的母亲，更多的信息。有很多人要求在选举前发布信息，但那是不可能的。举报者告诉我们，信息将在选举后发布。我也对信息可能在选举前夕引起的创伤感到深切的担忧，对我来说，利用这种创伤性的信息谋取[[zh:政治]]利益是不道德的。

现在，我们已经来到一个不公开的[[zh:地点]]，与一位在统计分析方面经验丰富的[[zh:新西兰]]临床[[zh:数学]]家会面。这个人与我们一起审查了数据，并确认了我们的立场是非常严重的。数据显示，与[[zh:疫苗]]接种有关的死亡人数达到了成千上万，而这只是[[zh:新西兰]]记录这类信息的一个站点之一。我们不知道国内还有多少类似的数据库，因此死亡人数通常少于副作用人数，因此，伤亡[[zh:新西兰]]人数的外推开始变得非常令人震惊。

我们在数据中看到有很多死亡人数的集群，这些人在同一接种点接受了[[zh:疫苗]]注射，并在同一天连续接种。我们看到他们接种的日期，也看到了他们的死亡日期。让我给你举一个例子，只是众多例子中的一个。有一天，有30人在同一个[[zh:地点]]接种了[[zh:疫苗]]，现在他们都去世了，而他们的死亡日期非常接近。这就是30人，相当于一场橄榄球比赛中的所有球员，突然去世。从统计学上看，我们看到的死亡人数不能归因于自然原因，考虑到相同的接种[[zh:地点]]和接种日期，从统计学上来说，这是高度不可能的。

我们呼吁进行一项调查，不仅仅是一项普通的调查，而是一项全面深入的[[zh:刑事调查]]，毫不留情。[[zh:新西兰]]成了一个犯罪现场，与COVID应对有关的任何人的计算机，无论以任何身份，手机、通讯设备、[[zh:银行]]账户、档案，以及其他大量有针对性的信息都必须被查封。我们有依据《官方信息法》的证据，证明在[[zh:新西兰]]进行第一次接种之前，[[zh:政府]]就已经知道每一种副作用，因此这些证据打破了“安全有效”的说辞。它还强调了我在这份声明中所说的事情的重大性和巨大性，我们拥有的《官方信息法》证据已附在nzloyal.org.nz网站的帖子下方（编者注，网址为——[https://nzloyal.org.nz/](https://nzloyal.org.nz/) ）。

但有一点可以肯定，这个[[zh:国家]]不应再[[zh:接种疫苗]]，已经有太多人失去了生命。我们在检查的名单上看到有13名儿童，我们已经对此进行过单独检查，自从这位举报者接触到我，说他们希望我一旦中选后立即在议会里发布这些信息时，我一直在挣扎要不要立即发布这些数据。为什么呢？因为很明显，一旦这些信息完全公开，它将阻止更多的生命损失。实际上，我是如此地致力于阻止在这个[[zh:国家]]继续通过注射器进行谋杀，以至于我愿意在选举前夕冒着风险公开我的面孔和名字。我亲眼看到了这些信息。从那时起，我就一直难以入眠，因为我知道现在可以获得这种详细程度的信息，但我们今天却发现这些信息被隐瞒了。你知道，举报者总是面临巨大的风险，就像我们所有试图在紧急情况下将真相带给这个[[zh:国家]]的人一样。

我无法理解，在持续发生伤害的情况下，为什么这些数据不立即公开，以结束这种伤害并展开全面深入的[[zh:刑事调查]]。因此，我呼吁[[zh:新西兰]]的人民，你们都必须要求停止[[zh:接种疫苗]]。如果不立即解决，[[zh:世界卫生组织]]将能够宣布下一个大流行，并在《大流行应对法》下强制进行大规模[[zh:疫苗]]接种，这将很快成为现实，研究一下这个。

**你还必须理解“调查”和我们呼吁的“[[zh:刑事调查]]”的区别，这就是****[[zh:温斯顿·彼得斯]]所呼吁的，而我们所呼吁的是进行[[zh:刑事调查]]****。调查通常导致狭窄的调查范围，并可能会冒着只是做表面工作、没有实质性变化的风险，但结果几乎没有变化。相比之下，[[zh:刑事调查]]涉及查封和深入审查和暴露所有的事实。**

我将要在[[zh:新西兰]]所做的事情是，如果这位举报者最终找到了我们在[[zh:新西兰]]忠实所展现的决心，并再次接触我，表示愿意披露一切，那么我将把这些信息交给[[zh:温斯顿·彼得斯]]（Winston Peters）。我不寻求任何回报，除了我一直寻求的，那就是为我的[[zh:国家]]服务。如果他们有[[zh:勇气]]充分展示我们今天所看到的内容，我将愿意把它提供给[[zh:温斯顿·彼得斯]]（Winston Peters），并希望他一起努力来揭示这些信息。我也希望他能获得所有的荣耀。我最希望的是，这些真相最终能够传达给你，[[zh:新西兰]]人民。

我今天的最后一句话是：我祈祷，最终争吵可以停止，恶意行为，相互破坏可以停止，而这个重要的问题，这个关键的站在一起，最终能够让我们所有的[[zh:新西兰]]人团结在一起，让我们挺身而出，向这个新[[zh:政府]]说出我们要求揭示真相的声音。
