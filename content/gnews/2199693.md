据[The Vigilant Fox](https://twitter.com/VigilantFox) [@VigilantFox](https://twitter.com/VigilantFox) [](https://twitter.com/VigilantFox)于[6:25 AM · Jan 9, 2024](https://twitter.com/VigilantFox/status/1744485599099146480)发布的推文——

Here's something you won't hear from the TV. The CDC told you that the COVID-19 "vaccine" would reduce the risk of so-called long COVID, but a study has found the exact opposite to be true. When you crunch all the numbers, the study showed that a person who received two doses of the COVID-19 "vaccine" prior to actually getting infected with COVID was 2.32 times more likely to develop long COVID than an unvaccinated individual. Is anyone surprised?

【这是电视上不会告诉你的事情。[[zh:疾控中心]]告诉你，COVID-19“[[zh:疫苗]]”会降低所谓的长期[[zh:新冠]]风险，但一项研究发现事实正好相反。当你计算所有数据时，研究表明，在实际感染[[zh:新冠]]之前接种了两剂COVID-19“[[zh:疫苗]]”的人，患上长期[[zh:新冠]]的可能性是未[[zh:接种疫苗]]个体的2.32倍。有人感到惊讶吗？】

以下为本文引用视频的全英文纪要：

If the individual experienced a severe case of COVID, they were something like three times more likely to experience the symptoms of long COVID compared to someone who just had a mild infection, which is a finding that's frankly not that surprising. However, what was perhaps actually surprising was the connection that they found between being vaccinated and developing long COVID.

Quote: During the four-week follow-up, patients were more likely to experience long COVID if they had pre-existing medical conditions or if they had received two COVID-19 vaccine doses. Although previous vaccination was associated with long COVID, the authors could not find any interaction effect of COVID-19 vaccination and acute COVID-19 severity on causing long COVID.

This implies that prior vaccination was independently associated with the occurrence of long COVID, meaning in plain English that a person who had previously gotten two shots of the COVID vaccine was significantly more likely to suffer long COVID following a COVID infection, and the risk indeed appears to be significantly higher. In the paper, the researchers calculated something known as the adjusted odds ratio, which is the odds of something happening adjusted for other controlling variables, and in the paper, it showed that a person who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine prior to actually getting infected with COVID was 2.32 times more likely to develop long COVID.

Again, this means that a fully vaccinated person was found to be about 2.3 times more likely to develop long COVID compared to an unvaccinated person. Now, this finding obviously flies in the face of the current conventional official stance by the US government. For instance, over on the CDC's website, they specifically wrote that, quote, "the purpose of these vaccines is to save lives and prevent severe disease. They can also reduce the risk of long COVID." And so you have the CDC, over on their official website, saying that the vaccine can reduce the risk of getting long COVID, while this study right here shows that a vaccinated individual's risk of getting long COVID is 2.3 times higher than an unvaccinated person's.

本文引用视频的中文大意如下：

如果个人患有严重的 COVID 病例，他们有可能比只患轻微感染的人，经历长期[[zh:新冠]]症状的可能性高出大约三倍，坦率地说，这一发现实际上并不令人惊讶。然而，也许真正令人惊讶的是他们发现[[zh:接种疫苗]]与患上长期[[zh:新冠]]的联系。

引述：在为期四周的随访期内，患者如果有既往疾病或接种了两剂 COVID-19 [[zh:疫苗]]，更有可能经历长期 COVID。尽管先前的[[zh:疫苗]]接种与长期[[zh:新冠]]相关联，但作者未能找到 COVID-19 [[zh:疫苗]]接种和急性 COVID-19 严重程度在导致长期[[zh:新冠]]上的任何交互作用。

这意味着先前的[[zh:疫苗]]接种与长期[[zh:新冠]]的发生是独立相关的，换言之，已经接种过两剂[[zh:新冠]][[zh:疫苗]]的人在感染[[zh:新冠]]后更有可能出现长期[[zh:新冠]]症状，而且风险似乎明显更高。在论文中，研究人员计算了一个被称为调整后的几率比的指标，这是某事发生的几率，经过其他控制变量的调整后得出的结果。在论文中显示，一个在感染 COVID 前接种了两剂 COVID-19 [[zh:疫苗]]的人，患长期[[zh:新冠]]的可能性是 2.32 倍。

再次强调，这意味着一个完全[[zh:接种疫苗]]的人，其患长期[[zh:新冠]]的可能性是未接种者的大约 2.3 倍。这一发现显然与[[zh:美国政府]]目前的官方立场相悖。例如，在[[zh:疾控中心]]的网站上，他们明确写道：“这些[[zh:疫苗]]的目的是挽救生命和预防严重疾病。它们也可以减少患长期[[zh:新冠]]的风险。”因此，你可以在[[zh:疾控中心]]的官方网站上看到，[[zh:疫苗]]可以降低患长期[[zh:新冠]]的风险，而这项研究显示，[[zh:接种疫苗]]的个人患上长期[[zh:新冠]]的风险要比未接种者高出 2.3 倍。
