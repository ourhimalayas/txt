本文引用视频来源[Rodney Palmer – Mar 30, 2023 – Toronto, Ontario](https://nationalcitizensinquiry.ca/witness/rodney-palmer/)（2023年3月30日来自加拿大安大略省多伦多Rodney Palmer先生的证词），根据视频摘要【Mr. Rodney Palmer reports of how he was in Beijing when SARS broke out and how COVID was dealt with very differently. In chronological order, the systematic propaganda inflicted on Canadians by the CBC, regarding the safety of vaccines. He tells of many instances of the CBC journalists and newscasters lying to the public on their various broadcasts of news and other shows.】（罗德尼·帕尔默先生报告了他在SARS爆发时在[[zh:北京]]的经历，以及COVID是如何被处理的，处理方式大不相同。按时间顺序，讲述了CBC对[[zh:疫苗]]安全性所施加在[[zh:加拿大]]人身上的系统宣传。他讲述了许多CBC记者和新闻主持人在各种新闻和其他节目中向公众撒谎的情况。）以下内容为Rodney Palmer先生对于[[zh:加拿大广播公司]]也就是CBC采取宣传手段，对[[zh:新冠病毒]]来自[[zh:武汉实验室]]的极力掩盖的作证。

**Shawn Buckley****：**But you’ve been asked to testify about the standard process of newsgathering versus propaganda at the CBC, and I’m wondering if you can tell us about that this morning.

**Rodney Palmer****：**So to begin my presentation?

**Shawn Buckley****：**Yes, please.

**Rodney Palmer****：**I started noticing that something very different was happening at the CBC because I’m familiar with the process. I wanted to talk today specifically about the CBC, although what I’m about to say goes for most media, news media, in Canada. But the CBC is very different. If you’re the Toronto Star or CTV News or any private entity, Global News, and you want to publish something that maybe isn’t true or you want to take the position of a pharmaceutical company, you can do that. If you want to trick your viewers into believing something that isn’t true, there’s really nothing to stop them from doing that. However, the CBC is a public entity. We pay for it. It broadcasts on the public airwaves, and we expect them to tell us the truth because they’ve done it for 50 or 60 years.

So what I started noticing was something very different. About a week, maybe two at the most, into the emergency, there was a story on “The National” by Adrienne Arsenault, one of the greatest broadcasters we have, a national treasure. Adrienne has a particular ability to appear to be discovering the facts in the moment, even if it’s take-20. She can do it every time. She’s a genius at what she does. But she turned this ability against us.

I saw a piece on the 4th of April where she opens up and she’s looking at her phone and she says, “What do you do if this happens? Somebody sends you a family text, say it’s your father, and he thinks that the virus was manufactured by China.” This is on April 4th, 2020. It says 2023 on the slide. That’s incorrect. It was 2020. And I thought, well, wait a minute. How do you know it wasn’t manufactured in a lab in China? What evidence does the CBC have 20 days into this, or 15 days into this, that this was not manufactured in a lab? There was an assumption that she put forth instantly. And then she went to an expert guest who said, “Well, don’t embarrass your father. You’ll just push him away.”

You’ve got to bring him in and you’ve got to kind of convince him. And I thought, well, I’m a father. Who are you speaking to? You’re telling my children not to believe their father. I have some expertise and some experience in this particular field. And I thought it was shocking that the CBC was trying to get in between me and my children. And the expert witness was from an organization called First Draft. And she simply says, “I’m from First Draft. We’re a non-profit that helps people navigate misinformation on the media”. And I think of non-profits, I think of the Cancer Society, the Diabetes Society. I don’t think of a group of people who are attempting to change the minds of strangers from believing things that they don’t want them to believe. I thought that was all very odd.

So I looked into First Draft and I saw that this organization was developed, and is developing, “new techniques and methodologies for investigating online spaces. Our latest approach revolves around the concept of recipes. As with food recipes,” says their website, “these steps give directions to investigators” or to reporters. So they give samples of what you can do. They say, “here’s an Investigation: How anti-vaccination websites build audiences and monetize information.” This is two weeks into the emergency. “Here’s the Recipe: how are these anti-vaccination websites funded?” Investigate the ad trackers with Gephi and DMI tracker tool. Now these are tools that they provide to, apparently, the CBC.

Now there was a story that circulated later about anti-vaccination websites on Marketplace and how they make their money. So this First Draft group is now feeding the CBC their stories.

A second example: Pro-Russian networks are driving anti-Pfizer vaccine disinformation. Now, I don’t know why the CBC has to get behind Pfizer, which has paid out the largest criminal settlement in the history of American justice, but this is what this organization is saying: “Don’t be against Pfizer. The Russians are behind it.” The recipe was: “Track misinformation across platforms such as 4chan, 8kun and Reddit.” So they’re even telling them how to go after them, where to go after them. They’re directing the CBC. I was astonished that this organization was put forth as an expert on how to not believe your father, but not embarrass him at the same time. So this to me had nothing to do with newsgathering.

Ten days later, after the CBC did that story, the Washington Post did some real journalism. They pointed out that the State Department cables were sent from the US Embassy in Beijing to Washington in 2018, warning about the Wuhan Institute of Virology, that it was unhygienic. And in particular, they said there was “a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate” the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This is January 2018. And there were two cables sent, and the reporter saw one of them. “The first cable, which I obtained,” he says, this is Josh Rogan from the Washington Post, “warns that the labs work on bat coronaviruses, and their potential human transmission represented a risk of a new SARS-like pandemic.”

So not only at the moment when Adrienne Arsenault was telling you, “Don’t believe your father if he thinks it came from a lab,” it was not only probable that COVID came from the lab, but it had been predicted that it would happen two years prior by the US government. So how does Adrienne Arsenault say it wasn’t and don’t believe anyone, including your family?

Flash forward a year: Vanity Fair magazine, which is known for its excellent investigative reporting, published an extremely long and exhaustive piece where all they did was go online and look at publicly available scientific papers going back about a decade.

The first one in 2013 was by Shi Zhengli, who’s the director of emerging infectious disease at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. She’s known as the bat lady, and this is not a derogatory term. Actually, her scientist friends started calling her that because there was an outbreak of a SARS-like respiratory virus in a mine, and the miners died very, very quickly. And she is documented to having gone to that mine, scraped the bat guano off the mine, and brought it to Wuhan to examine.

In 2014, she began publishing about the coronavirus from Chinese bats. In 2015, there was another paper that Vanity Fair found where Shi Zhengli discussed successfully inserting a protein from this Chinese horseshoe bat virus into the SARS virus of 2002, creating a brand-new infectious pathogen. In 2015, this scientific paper was published.

Vanity Fair found it online. CBC could have found it, but they were too busy telling you don’t trust anyone who believes this.

In 2019, there was a paper actually published by one of the lab directors at Wuhan, outlining the safety deficiencies in the Wuhan lab where he worked. And in 2019, right around the time that the US government, the US embassy in Beijing was warning Washington about a potential SARS-like pandemic leaking out of this unhygienic lab, a number of the Wuhan lab scientists published a paper together describing genetically engineered rats that they had grown with humanized lungs and developed them in the Wuhan lab.

So this is a pretty hot smoking gun coming out of the Wuhan lab. There are three labs in the world working on coronavirus, according to the Vanity Fair investigation. Two of them in the United States, one of them is in Wuhan. If this thing started at a wet market outside the Wuhan lab, it was because one of the staff members of the Wuhan lab walked into the wet market and brought it there. That is the most likely scenario.

Now flash forward to this month, March 2023, US FBI Chief Christopher Wray says that China lab leak was most likely. The quote is, “The FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident.” So the CBC had no evidence that it wasn’t. They wanted you to believe that it wasn’t.

There’s a definition of newsgathering, and you’ll see interestingly that “newsgathering” is one word in the English language. It’s not two words as it appears that it should be. And that’s because it’s very specific. It’s the process of doing research on news items, especially ones that will be broadcast on television or printed in a newspaper.

Now, how much research was done by the CBC to determine, 10 days after the emergency, that it didn’t happen in a lab? Another definition here is propaganda: “Persuasive mass communication that filters and frames the issues of the day in a way that strongly favors particular interests, usually those of a government or a corporation. Also, the intentional manipulation of public opinion through lies and half-truths and the selective retelling of history.” This is what was going on in that piece. That’s why it felt so wrong to me because there was no news involved. There was only propaganda.

What the Washington Post did with its lab leak theory story, 10 days after the CBC said it wasn’t from the lab, was newsgathering. It was investigative reporting. What the CBC did when it said, “don’t trust your family if they think it came from a lab,” that’s propaganda. That’s the difference in the definition of those two things.

The Vanity Fair piece: reviewing scientific publications for a decade, uncovering the fact that human lungs were engineered on rats in Wuhan lab in 2019 just before the outbreak, is newsgathering. Exceptional newsgathering, I’m jealous of how good that newsgathering was. What the BBC did reporting on the FBI, saying they’ve known for a long time that it came from the lab, was newsgathering. That’s kind of news of the day, daily news. They said it. We’re telling you they said it. What the CBC did by warning Canadians not to trust their fathers about a lab leak theory was propaganda.

March 4th, 2021, about a year after the emergency, the editor in chief of CBC News, Brodie Fenlon, wrote on his blog: “A recent survey found that about half of Canadians think journalists are purposely trying to mislead them.” Well, that’s because we’re on to you. At least half of us pay attention to our gut and we know that you are purposely trying to mislead us.

But Mr. Fenlon said that CBC is going to correct this. To promote trust in journalism, the CBC has joined four organizations. I didn’t know that they joined these organizations until I began to look into this a little bit. One of them is called the Trusted News Initiative, which is designed to filter news through its own “Trust Filter System.” Another one’s called the Journalism Trust Initiative. It’s basically the same name, but this one does more or less the same thing. Another one’s called the Trust Project, and then Project Origin. Notice that none of these organizations have the word ‘truth’ in them. If you tell the truth consistently, trust is automatic. If you don’t tell the truth consistently, you have to say things like, “please trust me.”

I’m just going to quickly outline what these things are, because they’re all basically the same thing. The Trusted News Initiative and the CBC announced together on the 27th, prior to the Adrienne Arsenault piece, that CBC and Radio Canada are “joining an industry collaboration of major media and technology organizations to rapidly identify and stop the spread of harmful coronavirus disinformation.”

I think the pandemic really started in China about four months prior to this, and four months prior to an unknown virus killing so many people, there is no disinformation.

The scientists among our commissioners will tell you there is only information, and all information is critical at the beginning—particularly at the beginning. So immediately, they were in a position of pushing one side of the story. Stopping misinformation means censoring, censorship, pure and simple.

本文引用视频对应中文大意为：

**Shawn Buckley****：**但您被要求就CBC的新闻收集流程与宣传作证，我想知道您能否今天上午谈谈这件事。

**Rodney Palmer****：**那么，开始我的陈述吗？

**Shawn Buckley****：**是的，请开始。

**Rodney Palmer****：**我开始注意到CBC发生了一些非常不同寻常的事情，因为我熟悉这个流程。我今天特别想谈论的是CBC，尽管我要说的话也适用于[[zh:加拿大]]的大多数媒体，但CBC与众不同。如果你是[[zh:多伦多星报]]或CTV新闻或任何私营实体，全球新闻，如果你想发布一些可能不真实的东西，或者你想站在[[zh:制药]][[zh:公司]]的立场上，你都可以做到。如果你想欺骗你的观众相信一些不真实的东西，没有什么能阻止他们这样做。然而，CBC是一个公共机构，我们为它付费。它在公共频道播出，我们希望它告诉我们真相，因为他们在过去50或60年中一直这么做。

因此，我开始注意到了一些非常不同寻常的事情。在紧急情况发生后大约一周，或者最多两周，有一个由Adrienne Arsenault进行的“[[zh:国家]]级新闻”报道，她是我们最优秀的播音员之一，是[[zh:国家]]的宝藏。Adrienne有一种特殊的能力，在当时似乎是发现事实，即使这是一个拖延了20次的情况，她每次都能做到，她在她所做的方面是一个天才，但她把这种能力转向了我们。

我在2020年[[zh:4月4日]]看到了一个报道，她打开手机说：“如果发生这种情况怎么办？有人发给你一个家庭短信，比如说是你的父亲，他认为[[zh:病毒]]是[[zh:中国]]制造的。”这是在2020年[[zh:4月4日]]，幻灯片上显示的是2023年，这是错误的，是2020年。我想，等一下，你怎么知道它不是在[[zh:中国]]的一个实验室制造的？CBC在这场[[zh:事件]]发生后20天或15天内，有什么证据表明这不是在实验室里制造的？她立即提出了一个假设。然后她去找一个专家嘉宾，说：“嗯，不要让你父亲感到尴尬。你只会把他推得更远。”

你必须把他拉进来，你必须说服他。我想，我也是一个父亲。你在对谁说话？你在告诉我的孩子不要相信他们的父亲。我在这个领域有一些专业知识和经验。对我来说，CBC试图插手我和我的孩子之间是令人震惊的。而这位专家证人来自一个叫First Draft的[[zh:组织]]，她只是说：“我来自First Draft，我们是一个[[zh:非营利性组织]]，帮助人们在媒体上辨别错误信息。”对我来说，[[zh:非营利性组织]]通常是[[zh:癌症]]协会、[[zh:糖尿病]]协会之类的[[zh:组织]]。我不会想到一个试图改变陌生人对他们不希望他们相信的事情的看法的人群，我觉得这一切都很奇怪。

我研究了First Draft，发现这个[[zh:组织]]正在开发“调查在线空间的新技术和方法”。他们最新的方法围绕着“配方”概念展开，正如他们的网站所说，“就像配方一样，这些步骤为调查人员或记者提供指导”。所以他们提供了一些样本。他们说，“这是一个调查：反[[zh:疫苗]]网站是如何建立观众并将信息[[zh:货币]]化的。” 这是紧急情况发生两周后。“这是配方：这些反[[zh:疫苗]]网站是如何获得资金的？”

使用Gephi和DMI追踪工具调查广告追踪器。现在，这些是他们显然提供给CBC的工具。后来有一个[[zh:关于]]故事流传开来，这是[[zh:关于]]Marketplace上反[[zh:疫苗]]网站如何赚钱的故事。所以这个First Draft团队现在正在向CBC提供他们的故事。

第二个例子是：亲俄网络在推动反[[zh:辉瑞]][[zh:疫苗]]的[[zh:虚假信息]]。现在，我不知道CBC为什么要支持[[zh:辉瑞]]，而[[zh:辉瑞]]已经支付了[[zh:美国]][[zh:司法]]史上最大的刑事和解金，但这就是这个[[zh:组织]]所说的：“不要反对[[zh:辉瑞]]。[[zh:俄罗斯]]人是[[zh:幕后黑手]]。”这个“配方”是：“跟踪跨平台的[[zh:虚假信息]]，比如4chan、8kun和Reddit”。所以他们甚至告诉他们如何去对付，去哪里对付，他们在指导CBC。

我很惊讶这个[[zh:组织]]被推出为一个专家，教人们如何不相信自己的父亲，但同时又不让他们难堪。对我来说，这与新闻收集毫无关系。十天后，CBC报道之后，《[[zh:华盛顿邮报]]》进行了一些真正的新闻报道。他们指出，[[zh:美国国务院]]的电报是[[zh:美国驻北京大使馆]]于2018年发给[[zh:华盛顿]]的，这封[[zh:外交]]电报是有关[[zh:武汉病毒研究所]]的警告，警告该所不卫生。特别是他们说那里“严重缺乏适当[[zh:培训]]的技术人员和调查员来安全操作[[zh:武汉病毒研究所]]”。这是2018年[[zh:1月]]。有两封电报发送，记者看到了其中一封。“第一封电报，我获得了，”《[[zh:华盛顿邮报]]》的乔什·罗根说，“警告说实验室正在研究[[zh:蝙蝠冠状病毒]]，其潜在人传人性质代表了新的类似SARS的流行病的风险。”所以不仅在Adrienne Arsenault告诉你，“如果他认为它来自实验室，不要相信你的父亲”的时候，COVID很可能来自实验室，而且两年前[[zh:美国政府]]已经预测到了这一点。那么Adrienne Arsenault为什么会说它不是，并警告不要相信任何人，包括你的家人？

再快进一年：《名利场》杂志以其卓越的调查报道而闻名，发表了一篇非常长而详尽的文章，他们唯一做的就是在线查看了大约十年的公开[[zh:科学]]论文。2013年的第一篇文章是由[[zh:武汉病毒研究所]]新兴传染病主任[[zh:石正丽]]撰写的，她被称为蝙蝠女士，并不是一个贬义词。实际上，她的[[zh:科学家]]朋友开始称呼她这样，是因为一座矿山爆发了一种类似SARS的呼吸道[[zh:病毒]]，矿工们死得非常快。据记载，她去过那个矿山，从矿井上刮下了蝙蝠粪便，带到了[[zh:武汉]]进行检查。2014年，她开始发表[[zh:关于]][[zh:中国]][[zh:蝙蝠冠状病毒]]的论文。2015年，《名利场》发现了另一篇文章，[[zh:石正丽]]在其中讨论了成功地将这种[[zh:中国]]蝴蝶[[zh:蝙蝠病毒]]的[[zh:蛋白质]]插入2002年的SARS[[zh:病毒]]中，创造了一种全新的传染性[[zh:病原体]]。这篇[[zh:科学]]论文是在2015年发表的，《名利场》在网上找到了它。CBC也可以找到它，但他们太忙告诉你不要相信那些相信这些消息的人。2019年，[[zh:武汉实验室]]的一位主任实际上发表了一篇论文，概述了他所在的[[zh:武汉实验室]]的安全缺陷。在2019年，就在[[zh:美国政府]]、[[zh:美国驻北京大使馆]]警告[[zh:华盛顿]]有关潜在SARS类流行病可能泄漏出这个不卫生实验室的时候，一些[[zh:武汉实验室]]的[[zh:科学家]]发表了一篇论文，描述了他们在[[zh:武汉实验室]]培育的具有人类化肺部的基因改造大鼠。所以这是来自[[zh:武汉实验室]]的一个相当有力的证据。根据《名利场》的调查，世界上有三个实验室在研究[[zh:冠状病毒]]，其中两个在[[zh:美国]]，一个在[[zh:武汉]]。如果这个事情起源于[[zh:武汉实验室]]外的一个菜[[zh:市场]]，那是因为[[zh:武汉实验室]]的工作人员之一走进了那个菜[[zh:市场]]并将它带到了那里。这是最有可能的情况。快进到今年[[zh:三月]]，2023年，[[zh:美国联邦调查局局长]][[zh:克里斯托弗·雷]]表示，[[zh:中国]]实验室泄漏最有可能。他的话是，“联邦调查局很长一段时间以来一直认为，这场流行病的起源很可能是潜在的实验室事故”。所以CBC没有证据表明不是这样。他们希望你相信不是这样的。

新闻收集有一个定义，有趣的是你会看到，“新闻收集”是英语中的一个词。这不是两个单词，正如它应该是的那样。这是因为它非常具体。这是指对新闻[[zh:事件]]进行研究的过程，特别是那些将要在电视上播出或在报纸上刊登的新闻。那么CBC在紧急[[zh:事件]]发生后的10天内，到底做了多少研究来确定这不是实验室里发生的？

另一个[[zh:关于]]宣传的定义是：

“以有说服力的大众传播方式，过滤和框定当天的议题，强烈偏袒特定利益，通常是[[zh:政府]]或[[zh:公司]]的利益。同时，通过谎言、半真半假的手段有意操纵公众舆论，以及选择性地重新诠释[[zh:历史]]。”这就是那篇文章中所发生的事情，这就是为什么我觉得那么不对劲，因为其中没有涉及新闻，只有宣传。

《[[zh:华盛顿邮报]]》在《CBC》表示[[zh:病毒]]不是来自实验室之后的10天内[[zh:关于]]实验室泄漏理论的报道是新闻采集和调查性报道。《CBC》声称“不要相信你的家人，如果他们认为[[zh:病毒]]来自实验室”就是宣传。

这就是两者定义上的不同之处。

《Vanity Fair》的报道：对[[zh:科学]]出版物进行了十年的审查，揭示了2019年[[zh:武汉实验室]]在爆发前将人类肺部在老鼠身上进行基因工程的事实，是新闻采集。这是非常出色的新闻采集工作，我对那个新闻采集的水平感到嫉妒。

BBC报道FBI称他们早就知道[[zh:病毒]]来自实验室也是新闻采集。这属于当天的新闻，日常新闻。他们说了，我们在告诉你，他们说了。

《CBC》警告[[zh:加拿大]]人不要相信父辈对实验室泄漏理论的行为是宣传。

2021年[[zh:3月4日]]，紧急状态结束约一年后，《CBC News》主编 Brodie Fenlon 在他的博客上写道：“最近的调查发现大约有一半的[[zh:加拿大]]人认为记者故意试图误导他们。”那是因为我们已经看穿你们了。我们中至少有一半人关注我们的直觉，我们知道你们故意试图误导我们。但Fenlon先生表示CBC将纠正这一点。为了促进对新闻的信任，《CBC》加入了四个[[zh:组织]]。在开始研究这些[[zh:组织]]之前，我并不知道他们加入了这些[[zh:组织]]。其中一个[[zh:组织]]叫做Trusted News Initiative，旨在通过其自身的“信任过滤系统”过滤新闻。另一个称为Journalism Trust Initiative，基本上是相同的名字，但功能或多或少相同。另一个叫Trust Project，然后是Project Origin。请注意，这些[[zh:组织]]中没有一个有“真相”这个词。如果你持续讲真相，信任是自动的。如果你不持续讲真相，你就得说“请相信我”之类的话。我只是快速概述了这些东西，因为它们基本上都是一样的。

Trusted News Initiative和CBC在27号之前共同宣布，在Adrienne Arsenault报道之前，CBC和Radio Canada将“加入主要媒体和技术[[zh:组织]]的行业合作，迅速识别和制止有害[[zh:冠状病毒]][[zh:虚假信息]]的传播”。

我认为[[zh:疫情]]实际上是在此之前大约四个月在[[zh:中国]]开始的，而在一个未知[[zh:病毒]]导致如此多人死亡的四个月前，是没有[[zh:虚假信息]]的。我们的委员中的[[zh:科学家]]会告诉你，那只是信息，所有信息在开始时都至关重要——尤其是在开始时。因此，他们立即处于推动一个故事的一边的立场。阻止错误信息意味着审查，纯粹而简单的审查。
