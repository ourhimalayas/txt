## 视频|中共在校园发起支持俄罗斯侵略乌克兰的舆论战
` MOSVIDEO` [轉載自GNews](https://gnews.org/zh-hans/2329714/)

3月底，山东、陕西、浙江、黑龙江等多省学校举办了有关“乌克兰局势”的“手拉手线上集体备课活动”，

要求教育系统“准确把握俄乌局势的原则立场与口径”，让学生无条件接受官方立场，

防止学生对俄乌战争的独立判断，其目的是把控校园舆论将俄乌战争的责任推到乌克兰身上。

At the end of March, schools in Shandong, Shaanxi, Zhejiang,

Heilongjiang and other provinces held “hand-in-hand online

group lesson preparation activities on the “situation in Ukraine”,

requiring the education system to “accurately grasp the principle position and calibre of the situation in Russia and Ukraine”,

so that students would unconditionally accept the official standpoint and prevent them from making independent judgments about the war between Russia and Ukraine,

with the aim of controlling public opinion in schools to put the blame for the war between Russia and Ukraine on Ukraine.

3月25日，该活动在全国高校的网上集体备课活动由陕西师范大学马克思主义学院主办。

On 25 March, an online class preparation activity was hosted by the School of Marxism of Shaanxi Normal University.

随后浙江大学马克思主义学院承办了题为“对乌克兰局势问题的认识与引导”在全省高校的备课活动直播。

Subsequently, Zhejiang University’s School of Marxism hosted a live class preparation activity entitled “Awareness and guidance

on the situation in Ukraine” in the province’s universities.

黑龙江省教育厅也举办了该备课活动，有近万名教师参加。

The preparation activity was also organised by the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Education

and was attended by nearly 10,000 teachers.

山东省教育厅随即发出《关于举办“俄乌局势”集体备课活动的通知》，要求麾下各教育局、高等学校“准确把握俄乌局势”的原则立场与口径，切实做好学生的思想引导工作。

The Department of Education of Shandong Province then issued a notice on the organization of a group lesson

on the “situation in Russia and Ukraine”, requesting all education bureaus and higher education institutions under the command to “accurately grasp the principle position and calibre of the situation

in Russia and Ukraine” and to effectively guide students’ thinking.

一老师向学生解答“为什么俄罗斯出兵乌克兰？”时表示，第一是乌克兰政治腐败、经济凋敝、民族分裂并仇恨俄罗斯；第二是北约五次东扩，压缩俄罗斯的战略空间，已将俄罗斯逼上绝路，并向学生灌输“纳粹份子杀害了乌东地区俄罗斯族裔1.4万人”、“美国是俄乌战争的始作俑者”等虚构内容。

A teacher answered the question “Why did Russia send troops to Ukraine?” to his students. He said that, firstly, Ukraine was politically corrupt, economically depleted, ethnically divided and hated Russia; secondly, NATO had expanded eastwards five times, reducing Russia’s strategic space and pushing Russia to the brink of extinction, and taught students such fictions as “Nazis killed 14,000 ethnic Russians in the east of the country” and “the United States was the cause of the Russian-Ukrainian war”. The United States was the cause of the Russo-Ukrainian war” and other fictional content.

【盖文】中共是人类一切灾难的根源，是俄罗斯侵略乌克兰的始作俑者与背后金主。中共在校园刻意误导学生对乌克兰危机的认识与判断是令人发指的精神强奸，只有灭共才能拯救同胞！

[GETTR] The CCP is the root cause of all human disasters, and is the initiator and financial master behind Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. The CCP is deliberately misleading students on campus about the crisis in Ukraine, which is a heinous form of spiritual rape. Only the elimination of the CCP can save our compatriots!
