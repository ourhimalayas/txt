I truly appreciate all of you, no words can express my appreciation. Anybody who ignore our fellow fighters at the frontline, anybody who ignore our fellow fighters, who are facing such danger, the danger of the virus, are not our brothers and sisters.

**【Miles Guo’s Broadcast Highlights】2022.4.3 Any Ignorance from Our Fellow Fighters Will Not Be Worthy of Our Brother and Sisters**

**Miles:**

Those big shots of the world，one tycoon from Wall Street. A guy you read about everyday on the newspaper said, Miles, give me a few of your vests. My grandson wanted your vests. I asked why? He said that is great, he used to support the CCP, treat the CCP like his daddy, next to the bridge water. He is the second person who mostly invested in China, an investor of HNA, one of the earliest investors. Now he supports our whistleblower movement. He has been watching our support with Ukraine, he asked why you guys support Ukraine? I said, a promise to God, no specific purpose or interests, this is to let people know that we cannot be represented by the CCP. We are the Chinese people who are going to take down the CCP. We are preventing anti-Chinese activities, simple like that and nothing else.

Nobody is like me who worries about our brothers and sisters everyday. Those who are at the frontline of this war. That’s right, facing the danger of the virus can potentially get infected at any given moment, we must also endure criticism. I said we only have one goal here, to promote the NFSC and ROLF, to show that we are different from the CCP, simple like that. This guy was so touched, you know why he decided to change now, did you know? His son attended school in the UK, he needed to go to the UK for the graduation ceremony, must be vaccinated, just one shot, half paralyzed at home. You all know this guy, how many schools in Manhattan, how many hospitals he made donations to? Now, he was saved. Once he got to the hospital, after some assessments, a nurse said, this is the side effects of the vaccine. He was admitted in the hospital, getting a full blood clean up, stayed in the ICU for a few days, almost lost his life. This is the virus, the vaccine symptoms. They are all watching our broadcast about Ukraine, watching our work at the frontline.

I wanted to tell you guys, my brothers and sisters, just like what I said. No matter how handsome Eric is, how beautiful his voice is, he cannot tell you such story. This is my experience, this is the story, this is what you guys have done at the frontline. Our tent is like a book written by Jia Pingao, about a lamp in the darkness of Xin Jiang, in a shabby house. A house that was built by digging a hole, with a lamp in the room. I read this novel, I think you guys are the lamp. People of the Northwest still have hope. Eventually, the reporters located the lamp, heard people were having sex.

So, people still have hope, in this darkness, in this shabby house with sex noises. At such time hearing such noise, bring warmth to people, this is reproduction. Hope is in the reproduction, reproduction from a disaster. Also it creates hope, the only thing you cannot do is having sex out there, but your image of bringing hope to the world. Especially bringing hope to the Chinese people. I truly appreciate all of you, no words can express my appreciation. Anybody who ignore our fellow fighters at the frontline, anybody who ignore our fellow fighters, who are facing such danger, the danger of the virus, are not our brothers and sisters. If you guys needed something, I am willing to fulfill that request. Unless you guys don’t need it, not so much for the gentlemen, ladies are welcome.
