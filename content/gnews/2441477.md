以下为引用视频的全英文纪要：

**Kayla Pollock:** So thanks for having me. It's an honor to meet you Dr. McCullough, especially. Yeah, I've been looking for you for a while. So yeah, strange capacity to meet, but I'm here to, yeah, I guess to tell my story.

**Greg Bouden:** Well, I'm honored to bring you here. Let's start at the beginning. You are not an antivaxer. You went ahead and you received the Pfizer, I believe BioNTech original vaccines, both the first shot and the second shot. And then if I read your story correctly, it's about February 2022 you received a booster but with the Moderna, is that correct?

**Kayla Pollock:** Yeah, that's correct. The original two vaccines in Canada, I feel now looking back that we were sort of coerced into it. I worked at the school board and I also had a father who was dying in long-term care. He did die. In order to go visit him, I had to have those vaccinations. So I first got the first two.

And also, I was looking at things like from the World Healthful Organization that I know of in my years of being type 1 diabetic. I'm type 1 diabetic. I know that taking advice from the World Health Organization was normally like that is the go-to for medicine as per what I thought anyway. I'm not so sure anymore, but to be honest, that's really I wasn't like getting my news off Wikipedia. I thought I was doing the right thing.

And so it appeared to me in Canada that we were going to be forced to be getting our third. This is before the trucker convoy. And there was a lot of talks about that. We already had vaccine passports, and there was a lot of talks about getting third, and they were especially talking about if you're immune-compromised that you basically like if you don't get your vaccines and your boosters, you're gonna basically die of COVID is the way they made it sound. They didn't say that you're gonna die of it. They just said, you know, your chances of dying with it are much, much greater.

Looking back, I likely had very little to no risk of ever being all that sick if I were to get it. Now I have a lot of risk because I have very, very weak lung capacity on one side, but yeah. So that's why I got my third vaccine. It was February 22, 2022.

**Greg Bouden:** Can you tell the audience what happened in the time period over the next 24-48 hours? When did you first start having symptoms?

**Kayla Pollock:** A few days later, I had an episode where I got out of bed, and I immediately fell to the floor. I have mentioned before that I've had a cesarean section, so I do know what being paralyzed feels like, and I likened it to it was like my legs were paralyzed. Looking back, that was a very good explanation for what was going on, like they were, but within about 20 minutes, I was able to get up, and I was able to just move, and so everything was fine. There was no pain, there was nothing out of the ordinary.

I thought maybe I pinched a nerve or something. Or something. At first, I didn't feel that anything was I don't know, it just didn't rot on my bones, let's say.

**Greg Bouden:** So they send you home basically once you get better, right? You went to the Canadian healthcare.

**Kayla Pollock:** Well, at first, I didn't do anything because it really just was very quick, and I just I thought, you know, I just got out of bed, perhaps I had, like I said, maybe I just pinched something or been sleeping in a really strange position and got up and, you know, fell into the floor. It's like my legs just gave out. I think I've mentioned and I likened it to being paralyzed, but no one just goes paralyzed, do they?

So you know, I didn't think much of it until it happened a second time, and then that is when I said this is neurological, this needs to be dealt with immediately. And I knew that in Canada when you go to a hospital, you go to an emergency room here, they'll tell you, "That's nice honey, come back when you have symptoms, you know your legs are fine now, so come back when you have symptoms." They would do some blood work, and I knew I needed to see a neurologist, and your likelihood of seeing a neurologist in the ER is like 0. This is just I, especially at the hospital that I am thinking of, you know, and this is the only hospital that you're gonna get in in my area.

So, yeah. So I talk contact my doctor and just said, you know, I need to see a neurologist like now, and like now meant like 18 to 2 years, 18 months to 2 years waitlist. If you're lucky, they might get you in sooner, that's what Canadian healthcare is like, that was the answer I was given.

**Greg Bouden:** Dr. McCullough, what are you thinking as you're hearing this?

**Dr. McCullough:** Well, this is in many ways a neurologic emergency agency, this being paralyzed essentially without any trauma brings up what's called a differential diagnosis, a list of problems that can happen, and that can include tumors on the spinal cord, an ascending form of paralysis called Guillain-Barré syndrome, a problem called chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and of course transverse myelitis. So you know the doctors need to move pretty quickly, and on this, the go-to test is to actually do an MRI of both the spinal cord in the brain.

**Greg Bouden:** So Kayla, what did they end up doing? I know you have a recording of one of the documents.

**Kayla Pollock:** Well, this isn't even the incident yet, so I woke up February 22, 2022, and I had had no trauma, I was getting up to go to work that day, and I was, I went to get up and my brain went on, and I went oh I got to get the phone right away, I wanted to get to work, if I didn't answer the phone I would miss the opportunity to take a coworker's shift, and I was told that the day before it's kind of first come first serve, and I knew they would call me first, so I wanted to get that phone, get up and get my coffee went my brain went to do it, but I went to roll and I was paralyzed from the neck down.

I tried to scream, but nothing came out, so I was in a crisis, my boyfriend was home but he was downstairs, we were in a three-level townhouse, and I heard the vehicle start outside, and I went okay, I think this is Guillain-Barré, that's the only thing I can think of that off the top of my head that could be going on, usually I think though if I'm not mistaken I would have thought that would have come on pretty quickly after the vaccine, so I was already thinking that this could be vaccine related, but I knew it was neurological, I knew it was an emergency, and I knew I was quadriplegic at that time.

So I had trained service dogs luckily, and I had just been training my dog as a service dog, and also I was training him also as a guide dog just for fun because he was smart, I don't need a guide dog but I was just doing it for just for fun, and I was able to sort of whisper to the dog to go get my partner, he was very confused about what was going on, but he was walking up and down the stairs, walking up and down the stairs, and enough to get my partner to go what's wrong with the dog.

So he was coming up to me to basically say like something's wrong with the dog, I don't know why he won't, he's not following his routine, when he came up I was able to get his attention enough because I was able to basically like almost whisper, and I said call 9-1-1, and I said tell them I'm quadriplegic without trauma, and I knew he didn't know what it meant and I knew he didn't know how to spell it.

So he wouldn't freak out, so I was sort of half freaking out in my mind and half thinking it was treatable because I was thinking okay Guillain-Barré, maybe it's treatable. So the ambulance came, they took me to South Lake Regional Health Center in Newmarket, Ontario, and the emergency doctor came to me, and he did a couple of neurological assessment tests, and he said that in his assessment he found that I had a reflex.

So that meant I was faking. He told me that I was not paralyzed and that this was something that was psychosomatic, it was in my head, and he ordered a site consult. So he took the backboard off, he took the collar off, and I laid there paralyzed by myself alone in the hospital during this Covid time, and all of a sudden I got this excruciating pain in my neck.

I think it was several hours later it just was the worst pain I'd ever had in my life. It just came on suddenly, it was high in my neck, I did not have trauma to my neck, and then it was I started screaming, and I guess my lungs were able to scream loud enough that I remember screaming as loud as I could because it was like my body was trying to match the pain and I couldn't help it, like it just came out, and I remember the doctor then said I was in the hallway of course because they don't have rooms so the doctor said that he wanted to shut me up, so they gave me high doses of morphine so that I'd stop screaming. The nurses would tell me to shut up, they tell me, you know, because I was the one waiting for a site consult.

**Greg Bouden:** And this is why your lungs are already struggling to breathe to begin with what's going on, given morphine. Wow.

**Kayla Pollock:** A lot of morphine. And as soon as the morphine would wear off, I'd start screaming again, and they would just give me one morphine and I was like, I need an MRI, and they said no, like they were waiting for the site consult and I mean this site consult could take a day, two days, I mean this is the reality of the hospital, and I was told that and I knew that this was not in my head. Eventually, a doctor did come and he whispered into my ear, he said I have a friend that's at home, he's a radiologist and he is willing to read your scans if I can take you up to the MRI like now and I'm like absolutely I will go. He's like I don't think you're crazy, I don't think this is in your head.

So they did an MRI with and without contrast. They also did, like you said, a scan of my brain, and they compared it to a scan of my brain that had been done previously. They found a massive lesion on my spine from C2 all the way down to the bottom, incomplete in complete lesion. So, of course, then they had to rule out MS, they had to rule out cancer, they had to rule out infection, and of course, they tested me for Covid-19 because had this been Covid-19, then of course, this transverse myelitis episode would have been caused by Covid-19.

**Greg Bouden:** And you tested negative, correct?

**Kayla Pollock:** I corrected, tested negative.

**Greg Bouden:** Thank God, thank God. I mean, with all you're going through, that's the last thing you want to add in, that, you know, muddy the waters.

以下为引用视频的中文大意：

**Kayla Pollock:** 感谢你邀请我。能见到你很荣幸，尤其是[[zh:麦卡洛]]博士。是的，我一直在寻找你。是的，奇怪的机会让我们相遇，但我在这里，是来讲述我的故事的。

**Greg Bouden:** 我很荣幸能邀请你来这里。让我们从头开始。你并不是反[[zh:疫苗]]者。你先后接种了[[zh:辉瑞]]，我相信你打的第一针和第二针是BioNTech[[zh:疫苗]]。如果我对你的经历理解正确的话，大概是在2022年[[zh:2月]]你接种了一剂[[zh:莫德纳]]的增强针，是这样吗？

**Kayla Pollock:** 是的，没错。在[[zh:加拿大]]，最初的两种[[zh:疫苗]]，现在回想起来，我觉得我们在某种程度上被迫接种了它们。我在学校[[zh:董事会]]工作，还有一个在长期护理机构濒临死亡的父亲，他后来去世了。为了去探望他，我必须接种那些[[zh:疫苗]]，所以我首先接种了前两种。

另外，我看了一些[[zh:世界卫生组织]]的东西，在我作为1型[[zh:糖尿病]]患者的这些年里我了解到，我是1型[[zh:糖尿病]]患者，我知道从[[zh:世界卫生组织]]那里获得建议通常是医学的首选，至少我是这样认为的。不过现在我不太确定了，但说实话，我并不是从[[zh:维基百科]]上获取信息，我以为我做得是正确的事情。

所以在我看来，[[zh:加拿大]]似乎要强迫我们接种第三针。这是在卡车司机抗议之前。当时有很多讨论。我们已经有了[[zh:疫苗护照]]，有很多[[zh:关于]]接种第三剂的讨论，特别是当他们谈到如果你免疫力低下，那么基本上就是，如果你不[[zh:接种疫苗]]和增强剂，他们的说法就是你基本上会死于COVID，他们没有说你会死于COVID，他们只是说，你死于它的概率要高得多得多。

回想起来，我患病的风险很可能非常低，几乎可以说是零。现在我有很大的风险，因为我的一侧肺功能非常弱。所以这就是我接种第三剂[[zh:疫苗]]的原因，那是在2022年[[zh:2月22日]]。

**Greg Bouden:** 你能告诉观众接下来的24-48小时发生了什么吗？你是什么时候开始出现症状的？

**Kayla Pollock:** 几天后，我有一次[[zh:事件]]，我从床上起来后立刻摔倒在地。我之前曾经做过剖腹产，所以我知道被瘫痪的感觉是什么样的，我把它比作我的腿像是瘫痪了。回顾起来，这是对发生的事情的一个很好的解释，就好像它们是，但大约20分钟后，我就能起床，能动了，一切都没事了。没有疼痛，没有任何异常。

我当时以为可能是我夹到了神经或者其他什么。起初，我没有感觉到任何异常，我不知道，就好像我的骨头上没有腐烂的感觉，可以这么说。

**Greg Bouden:** 所以他们基本上是在你好转后就把你送回家了，对吧？你去了[[zh:加拿大]]的医疗保健系统。

**Kayla Pollock:** 嗯，起初，我什么都没做，因为这确实很快，我只是想，你知道，我刚刚起床，也许我只是夹到了什么东西，或者是睡在一个非常奇怪的姿势，然后起床，你知道，摔倒在地。就好像我的腿突然间不听使唤了。我记得我说过，我把它比作被瘫痪，但是谁会突然间变成瘫痪呢？

所以你知道，我没太在意，直到第二次发生的时候，那时我说这是神经问题，这需要立即处理。我知道在[[zh:加拿大]]，当你去医院，来到这里的急诊室时，他们会告诉你，“好好的，亲爱的，等你有症状了再回来，你现在的腿没事了，所以等你有症状了再回来。”他们会做一些血液检查，我知道我需要看神经科医生，而在急诊室见到神经科医生的可能性几乎为零。尤其是在我想到的那家医院，这是我所在地区唯一的医院。

所以，是的。所以我联系了我的医生，只是说，你知道，我现在需要看神经科医生，就是现在，而“现在”意味着等待18到2年，即18个月到2年的等待名单。如果你幸运的话，他们可能会尽快让你见到，这就是[[zh:加拿大]]的医疗保健系统，这就是我得到的答案。

**Greg Bouden:** [[zh:麦卡洛]]博士，你听到这个时在想什么？

Dr. McCullough: 嗯，在很多方面，这是一个神经学的紧急情况，这种在没有任何外伤的情况下瘫痪的状况引发了所谓的鉴别诊断，即可能发生的问题清单，包括[[zh:脊髓]]肿瘤、称为格林\-巴雷综合征的逐渐性瘫痪、慢性炎症性脱髓鞘多发性神经病以及横贯性[[zh:脊髓]]炎。所以医生们需要尽快采取行动，对此，最常用的检查方法是对[[zh:脊髓]]和脑进行MRI检查。

**Greg Bouden:** 那么，Kayla，他们最终做了什么？我知道你有一份文件的录音。

**Kayla Pollock:** 嗯，这还不是那次[[zh:事件]]，所以我在2022年[[zh:2月22日]]醒来，我没有受伤，那天我起来准备去上班，我起床想着要赶紧拿手机，我想尽快上班，如果我不接电话，我会错过接替同事班次的机会，我前一天被告知是先到先得，我知道他们会先给我打电话，所以我想要抓住那个电话，起床拿到我的咖啡时，我的[[zh:大脑]]开始工作，但我试图翻身时，我从脖子到脚都瘫痪了。

我试图尖叫，但什么声音都没发出来，所以我处于危机之中，我的男朋友在家，但他在楼下，我们住在一座三层的联排别墅里，我听到外面车辆发动的声音，我说，好吧，我想这可能是格林\-巴雷综合征，那是我能想到的唯一可能发生的事情，通常我认为，如果我没记错的话，我会认为这可能是[[zh:疫苗]]后很快就发生的事情，所以我已经在想这可能与[[zh:疫苗]]有关，但我知道这是神经问题，我知道这是紧急情况，我知道那时我是四肢瘫痪的。

所以我幸运地训练了服务狗，我刚刚在训练我的狗成为服务犬，而且我也在训练他成为导盲犬，只是为了好玩，因为他很聪明，我不需要导盲犬，但我只是为了好玩而这么做，我能够对狗悄悄说，去找我的伴侣，他对发生的事情感到非常困惑，但他在楼梯上走来走去，上下楼梯，足够让我的伴侣注意到狗狗发生了什么问题。

然后他走到我身边，基本上是要说像是狗出了问题，我不知道为什么它跟平常不一样了，当他走过来的时候，我能够引起他的注意，因为我基本上几乎在低语，我说打 9-1-1，告诉他们我是四肢瘫痪，没有外伤，我知道他不知道这意味着什么，我也知道他不知道如何拼写它。

为了不让他惊慌，所以我在心里有些害怕，同时又觉得这是可以治疗的，因为我想到了格林\-巴雷综合征，也许是可以治疗的。然后救护车来了，他们把我送到了[[zh:安大略]]省纽马克特的南湖区域医疗中心，急诊医生来了，他做了几项神经评估测试，他说他的评估发现我有条件反射。

所以那意味着我在假装，他告诉我，我没有瘫痪，这是一种心理病，是在我头脑中，然后他要求咨询。所以他把背板拿掉了，拿掉了颈圈，我独自一人躺在医院里瘫痪了，在这个[[zh:新冠肺炎]]时期，突然我脖子剧烈疼痛起来。

我想几个小时后吧，这是我一生中最糟糕的疼痛，突然间就来了，很疼，位置在我颈部很高的地方，我脖子没有受伤，然后我开始尖叫，我想我的肺能尖叫出来，因为我记得我尽可能地尖叫，因为我感觉像是我的身体试图与疼痛匹敌，我无法控制，它就发生了，我记得医生当时说我在走廊上，因为他们没有房间，医生说他想让我安静下来，所以他们给了我高剂量的吗啡让我停止尖叫，护士们会告诉我闭嘴，他们告诉我，你知道，因为我是等待咨询的人。

**Greg Bouden:** 这就是为什么你的肺部已经开始呼吸困难，给你注射吗啡，天哪。

**Kayla Pollock:** 大量的吗啡，一旦吗啡作用消失，我就会再次尖叫，他们只给我一次吗啡，我说我需要做核磁共振，他们说不行，他们在等待咨询，我的意思是这个咨询可能需要一天，两天，我的意思是这就是医院的现实，我被告知了，我知道这不是我头脑里的事。最终，一位医生确实来了，他对我耳语说，他说我有一个朋友在家，他是一名放射科医生，他愿意查看你的扫描结果，如果我能带你去做核磁共振，我说绝对可以，我会去。他说我不认为你疯了，我不认为这是你头脑中的事情。

所以他们做了一次有和没有造影剂的核磁共振，他们还做了像你说的一样的我的脑部扫描，并将其与之前做过的我的脑部扫描进行了比较。他们在我的脊柱上发现了一个巨大的病变，从C2一直延伸到底部，这是一个不完整的病变。所以，当然，然后他们必须排除多发性硬化症，他们必须排除[[zh:癌症]]，他们必须排除感染，当然，他们还对我进行了[[zh:新冠病毒]]检测，因为如果这是[[zh:新冠病毒]]，那么这次横贯性[[zh:脊髓]]炎发作肯定是由[[zh:新冠病毒]]引起的。

**Greg Bouden:** 你的检测结果是阴性，对吧？

**Kayla Pollock:** 是的，检测结果是阴性。

**Greg Bouden:** 感谢[[zh:上帝]]，感谢[[zh:上帝]]。我的意思是，考虑到你所经历的一切，你最不想添加的就是这个，你知道，让事情变得更加复杂。
