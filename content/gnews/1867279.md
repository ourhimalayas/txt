据[RefugeOfSinners (ROS)](https://twitter.com/RefugeOfSinner5)[@RefugeOfSinner5](https://twitter.com/RefugeOfSinner5) 于[8:55 PM · Oct 22, 2023](https://twitter.com/RefugeOfSinner5/status/1716075881276358950)发布的推文——

Dr Kirk Milhoan, Pediatric Cardiologist. "When the vaccine came out, it was very clear, especially with teenage boys, within 2 weeks of getting that second shot, we would see myocarditis. And if we had looked closer, we would have found a lot more."

【Kirk Milhoan 博士，儿科[[zh:心脏]]病医师。 “[[zh:疫苗]]问世后，特别是在青少年男孩中，很明显，在接种第二剂[[zh:疫苗]]后的两周内，我们就会看到[[zh:心肌炎]]。 如果我们仔细观察，我们本可以找到更多病例。”】

这一段推文所附视频对应的英文原文是：

When the vaccine came out, it was very clear, especially after the second shot, especially in teenage boys. Within two weeks of getting that second shot, we would see myocarditis. And if we were to look closer, we would have found a lot more. Probably up to 2%, 1 to 2% of males were being affected by the vaccine. That's because the vaccine was made, and this is all still experimental. It's not a good platform; it's a dangerous platform. The protein they chose was actually cardiotoxic.

So initially, they said that wasn't true, but the more information comes out, now they just have to admit it. Yeah, it causes myocarditis. I was at the World Congress of Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery, and the No. 1 cardiology abstract was presenting the data of COVID vaccine-induced myocarditis and the MRI findings. No. 1 abstract voted as the most important abstract, and what they said was yes, it is real, and over half, over 50% of kids do not fully recover from the myocarditis. They still have findings on the MRI, which can lead to sudden cardiac death.

这则推文所附视频对应的中文大意是：

当[[zh:疫苗]]问世时，情况非常清楚，特别是在第二次接种后，尤其是在十几岁的男孩中。在接种第二剂[[zh:疫苗]]后的两周内，我们会看到[[zh:心肌炎]]的病例。如果我们仔细调查，可能会发现更多情况，也许有高达2%，1到2%的男性受到了[[zh:疫苗]]的影响。这是因为这种[[zh:疫苗]]是实验性的，这不是一个良好的平台，而是一个危险的平台，他们选择的[[zh:蛋白质]]实际上具有[[zh:心脏]]毒性。

所以最初他们说这不是真的，但现在有更多信息出来，他们不得不承认：是的，它会引发[[zh:心肌炎]]。我参加了世界儿科[[zh:心脏]]病学和[[zh:心脏]]外科大会，而排名第一的[[zh:心脏]]病学摘要是[[zh:关于]]COVID[[zh:疫苗]]引发的[[zh:心肌炎]]和MRI检查结果的数据。这个排名第一的摘要被选为最重要的摘要，他们所说的是，是的，这是真的，超过一半，超过50%的儿童无法完全康复，他们在MRI上仍然有异常结果，这可能导致猝死。
