你看一看
Check it out

这是我们的战友，就是帮助肖建华
This is our fellow fighters, the one who helped Xiao Jianhua

做了800亿的金融信托的（战友）
made the RMB80 billion financial trust

可以说当初在他做之前
It can be said that before him

中国的信托就票据这一块，还得拿资产做抵押
China’s trust has to use assets as collateral for the sector of bills.
后来他（和肖建华）就说服了银行
Later, he and Xiao convinced the bank

让银行不再用地产做抵押，也就是信用抵押
Getting banks to stop using real estate as collateral, which means credit collateral

信用抵押就是说，大卫，你信七哥，是吧？
Credit collateral means, David, you believe in me, don’t you?

那就是，我开个条，就是100亿，1000亿
That is, I write a receipt, it means 10 billion, 100 billion

加个零1000亿，你看看
Add a zero to 100 billion, see？

你看看这个，钱是怎么来的
Look at this, where the money comes from

你们一定要学一学，一定要学一学
You should must learn from it, you must learn from it

中信信托，信托贷款，融资企业，抵押资产——股权、土地等有价物
CITIC Trust, trust loans, financing companies, collateralized assets – equity, land and other valuables

民生银行，业务到期后的资金流向
Minsheng Bank, the flow of funds after the maturity of the business

最终出资银行——民生银行
Final Funding Bank – Minsheng Bank

兴业银行，中信信托，就这么玩，就这么转
Industrial Bank, CITIC Trust, this is how to play with the money

中信信托，你看到没有，业务到期后的资金流向
CITIC Trust, have you seen the flow of funds after the business expires

信托受益权转让
Assignment of trust beneficiary rights

你说民生银行、兴业银行、中信信托、融资企业能好吗？
Do you think Minsheng Bank, Industrial Bank, CITIC Trust and financing companies can be good?

最终是什么？
What is the end result?

下一张，把下一张的字打出来
Next slide

大家记住，最终大家要看到发生了什么？
Remember, in the end, people are going to realize what happened

大家好好看一看
Take a closer look

猫腻全部在抵押资产的评估，放大了10倍和更大
The trick is in the evaluation of the mortgaged assets, magnified by 10 times and more

就是评估，是吧？
The assessment, right?
我拿资产去抵押，大卫的内裤花了两英镑买的
I took the asset as collateral. It’s like, David’s underwear cost him £2.

我给他一评估200英镑
I offered him an assessment of £200 for that underwear

是不是？你一抵押200英镑，是吧
Isn’t that right? You’ve got a £200 mortgage, right?

我这个内裤就给你了，我也不要了，是不是？
David’d say “I’ll give you this underwear, and I don’t want it, do I?”

我现在还穿着呢
“I’m still wearing it.”

就是杠杆放大
The trick is to enlarge the leverage

还有一个完全没有杠杆，完全假票据
There is also a completely unleveraged, completely fake financial instrument

猫腻在哪呢？来自泰山
What is the trick again? This is from our friend Tarzan

猫腻全在抵押资产评估放大10倍，甚至更大
The trick is to enlarge the appraisal of the mortgaged assets by 10 times or even more

最后直接无资产，无抵押，全凭信用了
Finally, no assets, no collateral, all on credit

明白了吗？兄弟姐妹们，谢谢泰山兄弟
Got it? Brothers and sisters, thank you brother Tarzan
