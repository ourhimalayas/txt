 English Version of 《克强之殇魂断改良》by Mr.3Rights[[zh:三票先生]] translator:Chloe蔻依


The suspicious death of former Prime Minister Li Keqiang marked the end of political reforms in China.


The Chinese Communist Party killed its people in the name of revolution, plundered their wealth in the name of public ownership, shared the spoils in the name of reform, and scourged the whole world in the name of opening up.

It was Mao Zedong who had plundered through killing, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin who had set up an oligarchy scheme to share the spoils, and Xi Jinping who started to wreck the whole world.

Mao was a dictator, Deng and Jiang were the heads of oligarchies, and now Xi resumed a dictatorship in China.

The Youth League, started in the 1980s and first led by Hu Yaobang, was a very beautiful sight to behold.

It brought the Chinese the hope of constitutionalism as it was a modern equivalent of Song Jiaoren and Chen Jiongming in the Republic of China.

Miles Guo exposed that given the damage from Mao’s dictatorship, several patriarchs of the CCP tried to cultivate the Youth League to be an independent party so that China could have a multiparty political system. But such a plan became a stillbirth due to the Tiananmen Massacre.

Both the kleptocracy nature of the CCP and some evil international power behind it determined the autocratic CCP was the best option for global elites and international capital because it could offer cheap slaves.

But the CCP is very treacherous and cunning, it had been treating the Youth League and its leaders including Hu Jintao and Li Keqiang as decorations that could offer Chinese elites and international communities the illusion of political reforms on the CCP.

The CCP is essentially a handful of kleptocrats who would never give up their control over China. So the Youth League and Li Keqiang were doomed to fail in 2007 when Jiang Zeming decided that Xi Jinping, the princeling, to be the Crown Prince and Li Keqiang to be the Prime Minister, the position Li was overqualified for.

As always, a manager could not defeat a controlling shareholder, a plebeian could not defeat a princeling, a nobleman could not defeat a rogue, a top student could not defeat a slacker, and a civilized could not defeat a barbarian.

The mysterious death of Li Keqiang unveiled Xi Jinping’s desire to be a dictator, so the bloodshed began.

The assassination of Song Jiaoren in 1913 ended the parliamentary cabinet political system;

The rout of Chen Jiongming and his flee to Hongkong in 1925 terminated the multiparty federalism;

Hu Yaobang’s death of a heart attack in 1989 led to the Tiananmen Square protest and massacre, the most promising political reform he initiated ended in a blood way.

Hu Jintao was grabbed by arms and escorted out from the CCP’s National Congress in Oct 2022,

He might never expect one year later to see off Li Keqiang, 13 years his junior.

Li Keqiang’s suspicious death in 2023 marked the end of political reforms, and revolutions should begin.

If we still pin our hopes on political reforms, China will be trapped forever between dictatorship and oligarchy because there will be a dictator following the next oligarchy……

Wake up, all the CCP elites who still count on political reforms. China will survive only when we take down the CCP through revolution and constitutionalism.

The revolution I referred to is a peaceful, non-violent one. It is what the Whistleblower Movement has been advocating and practicing. The Whistleblower Movement will surely lead China to a better future.

Political reforms are deadlocks, and a revolution should begin. This is what we learned from Li Keqiang’s death.

RIP Mr. Li Keqiang, as there is no CCP in heaven.

克强之殇 魂断改良

前[[zh:总理]][[zh:李克强]]死于非命，标志着[[zh:中共]]的改良彻底死亡！

[[zh:中共]]以革命的名义杀人，以公有的名义掠财，以改革的名义分赃，以开放的名义祸害全球。

[[zh:毛泽东]]完成了杀人掠财，邓江实现了分赃，习则祸害全球。

毛时代是独裁，邓江是寡头分赃，习又回到了独裁。

起于八十年代以[[zh:胡耀邦]]为首的[[zh:团派]]则是[[zh:中国]]近代文明进程中一道靓丽的风景线，好比民国时代的[[zh:宋教仁]]和[[zh:陈炯明]]，曾给[[zh:中国人民]]带来[[zh:民主]][[zh:宪政]]的希望。[[zh:郭先生]][[zh:爆料]]说八十年代[[zh:中共]]的几位元老鉴于毛独裁的祸害，曾希望培养[[zh:团派]]成为一党，发展多党[[zh:政治]]，可惜由于[[zh:六四]]而夭折。[[zh:中共]]的本性和国际邪恶力量决定了一个专制的[[zh:中共]]给全球资本提供廉价的奴隶。但[[zh:中共]]的狡诈和诡异的地方就在于他需要一个幌子来欺骗民众和国际社会，于是[[zh:团派]]成了[[zh:中共]]装点门面的遮羞布，就有了[[zh:胡锦涛]]和[[zh:李克强]]，继续让[[zh:中共]]精英和国际社会有改良[[zh:中共]]的梦想。 但终究[[zh:中共]]的基因就是几个[[zh:盗国贼家族]]控制[[zh:中国]]，于是2007年成了决定[[zh:李克强]]和[[zh:团派]]命运的分水岭，[[zh:江泽民]]为了让[[zh:盗国贼家族]]继续掌控[[zh:中国]]，选择了[[zh:红二代]][[zh:习近平]]为储君而[[zh:李克强]]屈居储相。

经理敌不过股东！平民敌不过红二！君子敌不过流氓！学霸敌不过学渣！文明敌不过野蛮！

[[zh:习近平]]扯掉了遮羞布彻底裸奔！从此没有岁月静好只有腥风血雨。

1913年[[zh:宋教仁]]死于暗杀，带走了多党内阁制；

1925年[[zh:陈炯明]]兵败逃港，带走了[[zh:联省自治]]；

1989年[[zh:胡耀邦]]心梗去世引发[[zh:六四]]之殇，[[zh:中国]]最有希望的[[zh:政治]]改革沉沙折戟；

2022年[[zh:10月]][[zh:胡锦涛]]被架离会场，没想到一年后白发人送黑发人；

2023年[[zh:李克强]]死于非命，意味着改良已死革命当立！

如果寄望于改良，20年后还会再出现一个张近平王近平，[[zh:中国]]还会在独裁与寡头专制之间[[zh:轮回]]。怀有改良梦想的诸公醒醒吧，唯有革命、[[zh:灭共]]、[[zh:宪政]]，[[zh:中国]]才有希望！ 当然我们提倡的是和平的非暴力革命，[[zh:爆料革命]]得风气之先，引领[[zh:中国]]的未来！

改良已死革命当立，这就是[[zh:李克强]]留给我们的[[zh:政治]]遗产！

天堂里没有[[zh:中共]]，克强先生安息[e-1f64f]
