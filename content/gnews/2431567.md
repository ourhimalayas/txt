以下为引用视频的全英文纪要：

**Elizabeth:** What happened, what happened next, what we're in the middle of now is we're in the middle of this phone call and he's given you, he's told you about the 2001 study and then what happened?

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Well, this was actually a compilation of about 40 to 50 phone calls we had over that 10 month period of time. I'm just kind of condensing it into you know a sort of a shorter time span but he you know he was able to get this information to me, he was able to reveal massive fraud around the MMR vaccine and then also around mercury containing vaccines.

You know back in the early 2000s the Hepatitis B vaccine had mercury in it, the hemophilous influenza of the year, the Hib vaccine had mercury in it, the DTP vaccine had mercury in it. And the CDC was coming down on the side that mercury in vaccines didn't cause autism and was actually good for you. You know that it was in some of their studies which were preposterous. They showed that it was preventing autism, that the more mercury got the better. Well, Mercury is a neurotoxin, and so we knew that that was preposterous.

But Thompson went into detail on how they cooked the books, how they peddled these fraudulent results. And then I went back and I checked what he said, and they actually edited the data. They not only, in order to get this cheat to work, to make it seem like there was no relationship between mercury and vaccines and autism, they would actually go in and add data from specific clinics that they were considering in their studies, and they would throw out those clinics that had a higher incidence of autism, and they would keep those clinics that would have the lower incidence of autism.

And so he showed me that directly, and to me, that type of cherry-picking, you know, it's lying, it's fraud. There is no other argument about it. It is pure and simple fraud, and it's my contention that they damaged a lot of children by doing that fraud and people should go to jail for the damage that they did. The entire world looks to the CDC for information. It's not just the United States.

**Elizabeth:** That's right, it has worldwide implications, huge, the CDC. So what's interesting to me here is it's the CDC is running these studies to check the safety of the vaccines. Why is there never a third party doing it? I mean, I suppose the CDC isn't a third party because it's not the pharma company.

But as it turns out, there was never any independent, I guess we're gonna counter that, but were there ever they were independent studies being done? Wasn't there, in parallel, some other scientists have gone out and done this work, can't they? Yeah, we'll get to that.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** There have been several independent studies, and that's why Mister Kennedy and I wrote the book because we found these studies where vaccinated versus unvaccinated children and adults had been compared. But the lion's share of those studies, there's over 100 studies that are featured in that book, the lion's are done by independent research groups, and the CDC's a captured agency there, you know, they buy and sell $5 billion worth of vaccines every year for the vaccines for children program. They spend $500 million a year on marketing vaccines in the United States, and they only spend about $50 million a year on vaccine safety.

So you can really see where the priorities are, and they get donations directly from large companies through what's called the CDC Foundation, they get direct donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, from other foundations that have hooks, The Merck Foundation gives money to the CDC, you know Merck, obviously a very, very large vaccine manufacturer, they manufacture the MMR vaccine, and you know they've and the CDC has performed well for their masters, you know they've indemnified the MMR vaccine, they've indemnified the HPV vaccine, both Merck products.

**Elizabeth:** Yeah. Okay, that's terrible. Going back to, it's a great summary, going back to that 2004 study, specifically you worked out that the data around the African American boys actually sorry Mr. Thompson admitted to you that the data for the African American boys was omitted and excluded from the study, that's right.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** It was just dumped and shredded and never saw the light of day except for of course Dr. Thompson saving his information on his hard drive. But what they did to cook the books was they diluted out the sample, they took children out if they didn't have a valid Georgia birth certificate. And so, but there's nothing magical about having a valid Georgia birth certificate. But this was a cohort of children that were in metropolitan Atlanta. But if they were born out of state, they said, "Oh well, you know, we want to look at only in-state because we had better records on them."

That was absolutely preposterous. They had the same records for in-state and out-of-state patients. And when you open up the books and we found that, but by taking away all of the out-of-state records, they made the sample size so small that they lost statistical significance. You know, in statistics, the bigger the sample you have, the more statistical accuracy you get. And so, in order to make the sample smaller and smaller and smaller, they'd say, "Oh well, we see there's kind of a relationship there but it's not statistically significant." And you know, that was the result of them cooking the books, making the sample smaller, and they never had to report that result because it would have been dynamite.

以下为引用视频的中文大意：

**Elizabeth:** 发生了什么，接下来发生了什么，我们现在正处于的中间阶段是我们正在进行这通电话，他给了你，他告诉了你[[zh:关于]]2001年的研究，然后发生了什么？

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 嗯，这实际上是在那10个月的时间里我们进行的大约40到50通电话的总结。我只是在把它压缩成一个更短的时间跨度，但你知道他能够把这些信息传给我，他能够揭露[[zh:关于]][[zh:麻疹]]风[[zh:疫苗]]以及含汞[[zh:疫苗]]的大规模欺诈。

你知道在2000年代早期，乙型肝炎[[zh:疫苗]]含有汞，当年的血球杆菌性流感[[zh:疫苗]]也含有汞，[[zh:百白破疫苗]]也含有汞。而[[zh:疾控中心]]支持[[zh:疫苗]]中的汞不会导致自闭症，实际上对你有好处。你知道在一些他们的研究中是荒谬的。他们显示含汞可以预防自闭症，而且含汞越多越好。嗯，汞是一种神经毒素，所以我们知道那是荒谬的。

但汤普森详细介绍了他们如何操纵数据，如何传播这些欺诈性的结果。然后我回去查验了他说的内容，他们实际上编辑了数据。为了让这种作弊行为生效，让人误以为[[zh:疫苗]]中的汞与自闭症之间没有关系，他们实际上会去添加来自特定诊所的数据，然后丢弃那些自闭症发生率较高的诊所，而保留那些自闭症发生率较低的诊所。

所以他直接向我展示了这一点，对我来说，这种挑选数据，这是在说谎，这是在欺诈，没有其他的争论。这就是纯粹而简单的欺诈，我认为他们通过这种欺诈伤害了很多孩子，这些人应该因为他们造成的伤害而被监禁。整个世界都在关注[[zh:疾控中心]]提供的信息，不仅仅是[[zh:美国]]。

**Elizabeth:** 没错，[[zh:疾控中心]]有着全球性的影响，巨大的影响。所以对我来说，这里有趣的地方是，[[zh:疾控中心]]正在进行这些研究以检查[[zh:疫苗]]的安全性。为什么从来没有第三方来进行呢？我是说，我想[[zh:疾控中心]]并不是第三方，因为它不是[[zh:制药]][[zh:公司]]。

但事实证明，从来没有独立的，我猜我们可以反驳，但是有没有曾经有独立的研究呢？难道，与此同时，一些其他[[zh:科学家]]没有出去做这项工作吗？是的，我们会谈到这个问题。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 已经有几项独立研究，这就是为什么[[zh:肯尼迪]]先生和我写了这本书，因为我们找到了这些研究，比较了[[zh:接种疫苗]]与未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的儿童和成人。但是，那本书中收录的100多项研究中，绝大多数是由独立研究小组完成的，而[[zh:疾控中心]]是一个被俘虏的机构，你知道，他们每年以50亿[[zh:美元]]的价格购买和销售[[zh:疫苗]]，用于儿童[[zh:疫苗]]计划。他们每年在[[zh:美国]]花费5亿[[zh:美元]]用于[[zh:疫苗]]营销，而只有大约5000万[[zh:美元]]用于[[zh:疫苗]]安全。

所以你真的可以看出他们的优先事项在哪里，他们直接从大[[zh:公司]]那里获得捐赠，通过所谓的[[zh:疾控中心]]基金会，他们直接从比尔和梅林达·[[zh:盖茨基金会]]以及其他有联系的基金会获得捐赠。默克基金会向[[zh:疾控中心]]捐款，你知道，默克显然是一个非常大的[[zh:疫苗制造商]]，他们生产[[zh:麻疹]]风[[zh:疫苗]]，你知道他们，[[zh:疾控中心]]为他们的主人表现得很好，他们已经为[[zh:麻疹]]风[[zh:疫苗]]提供了豁免责任，他们已经为宫颈癌[[zh:疫苗]]提供了豁免责任，这两个是默克的产品。

**Elizabeth:** 对，好吧，这太可怕了。话题转回来，这是一个很好的总结，回到那个2004年的研究，具体来说，你发现了围绕[[zh:非洲]]裔[[zh:美国]]男孩的数据，抱歉，汤普森先生向你承认了，这些数据被从研究中遗漏和排除了，是这样的。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 它只是被丢弃了，被销毁了，从来没有见过天日，除了当然汤普森博士将信息保存在他的硬盘上。但是他们为了篡改数据，他们稀释了样本，如果他们没有有效的[[zh:佐治亚]]州出生证明，他们就把孩子们排除在外。所以，但是拥有有效的[[zh:佐治亚]]州出生证明并没有什么神奇之处。但这是一个位于[[zh:亚特兰大]]大都会区的一群孩子。但是如果他们出生在其他州，他们说，“哦，好吧，你知道，我们只想看看州内的情况，因为我们对他们有更好的记录。”

那绝对是荒谬的，他们对州内和州外患者有相同的记录。当你打开账本，我们发现了这一点，但是通过剔除所有州外记录，他们使样本量变得如此之小，以至于失去了统计意义。你知道，在统计学中，样本量越大，你获得的统计准确性就越高。所以，为了使样本变得越来越小，他们会说，“哦，我们看到那里有一种关系，但这种关系在统计上并不显著。”你知道，这是他们操纵数据的结果，为了使样本变得越来越小，越来越小，他们从未不需要报告这个结果，因为那将是火药桶。
