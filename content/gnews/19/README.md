**郭文贵**

没有财富自由的家庭
A family without wealth and freedom

和谐、快乐、健康、 有尊严几乎都无从谈起
it’s almost impossible that know where to begin talking about harmony, happiness, health, and dignity

财富属性最后都是社会的
Wealth attribute is all belong to society in the end

这一句话就是，所有的钱都是归社会的
It means all money belongs to society

但是这个财富属性的创造者和享用者
But the creator and beneficiary of this wealth attribute

就是社会上最高级统治者
is the superlative ruler

这你就明白了钱到底咋回事儿
Then you will understand what the money is really about

然后也告诉我们货币是怎么回事
and then tell us what the currency is all about

金银怎么回事
as well as with gold and silver

这对我当时来讲，一个十几岁的孩子
To me at the time, a teenager

这是很大的事，就你认清了钱到底姓啥
that was a big deal because you recognized that who owns money at the end

你再过3年5年
3 years or 5 years later

你看今天你所有对财富的理解
look back to your understanding of all wealth today

你就觉得是个天大的耻辱和笑话
you would feel that it’s the biggest joke and shame

第3个就是最重要的
The 3rd one is the most important

当你有信仰和理想的时候，你会越来越明白
When you have beliefs and goals, you will understand more and more of

这个世界很伟大、很丑陋的两个极端
these two extremes in the world which are very and ugly

都伟大立不了财富
The wealth would not be created if everyone is great

丑陋是因为财富
Ugliness is because of wealth

当你把这个问题搞明白的时候
When you understand these questions

你想做伟大吗
Do you want to be virtuous?

你想做让你自己爱的人吗
Would you want to be the one that you love?

你想让别人发自内心的尊重你吗
Would you like to have others respected you by heart?

绝对你会知道，你要拥有干净的财富
You will definitely understand that you have to have a transparent wealth

财富会让你拥有自己的能力和证明的机会
and wealth will let you have the ability to own yourself and the opportunity to veri-fy

所以说
That being said

经过我做生意，搞酒店、房地产、金融
after I did business, engaged in hotels, real estate, finance

我所有的从清丰看守所出来以后（的经历）
and all experiences that I had inside the Qingfeng Detention Center

我发自内心地说，我一定要在财富上自由后
I had said it from bottom of my heart that I must be free in wealth

让家人都安全、孩子长大后
kept family members safe, and after children grew up

我灭共的事业才能开始
and then I could start my career of eliminating the communism

否则无从谈起
Otherwise, there’s no way to talk about it

但是财富这个东西，它也很有意思的
But wealth is also very interesting

财不是个单字，是一个贝一个才加个富成为财富
(The Chinese character) of “wealth” is not an individual character. It’s formed by the radical of a shell and talent, and add a rich to become wealth

财富是多人属性
Wealth is multi-person attribute

如果你一个人有钱那叫富有，它不叫财富
One person has the money doesn’t mean you are wealthy. It’s called rich

财富是多人属性下的
Wealth is based on multi-person attribute

当你把财富（跟）更多人分享的时候那你就是财富
When you share your wealth with more people, then you are wealthy

当我觉得新中国联邦人都拥有财富的时候
When I feel that all people of the New Federal China have wealth

那才叫真正的财富
that is the real wealth

财富可以创造权利
Wealth creates power

可以让权力干正事
and allow the authority to do the right thing

那么我们就要创造干净的财富去干干净的事
Therefore, we must create a clean wealth and to do clean business

这就是当初我想灭共之初
This is the beginning of my desire to eliminate the communists

这30年的准备, 时时刻刻想着
This has been prepared for 30 years and kept in my mind all the time
