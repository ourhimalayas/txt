东弟刚才讲的，这是法律，不是行政命令
What Hao Haidong brother just said, this is a law, not an executive order

这个词多大，你知道吗？
This word is huge, Do you know?

咱们今天受害的结果就（是）共产党所有的决定都是行政命令代替法律
The result of our suffering today is that all the decisions of the Communist Party are executive orders instead of laws

东弟在过去直播当中无数次采访他
In countless interviews with Hao Haidong brother in the past live broadcasts

咱没有人重视这句话
none of us has paid attention to this sentence

我专门跟外国人解释行政命令和法律
I specifically explained to foreigners about (the relationship between the CCP’s) executive orders and laws

你知道外国人99%的人不知道行政命令和法律是咋回事
You know that 99% of them did not know what’s going on with the executive orders and laws

外国没有行政命令
There are no executive orders ( substitute the laws) in foreign countries

这是我们根本的一个基础
This is our basic foundation

为什么铲共骑侠在中国
Why? (If) Shovel CCP Rider (guest speaker) is in China

律师你苦大仇深的
you, a lawyer suffering and with a deep hatred

上一边呆着去吧你，是不是？你连小姐的身份都不如
would be stayed by aside, right? Your identity is not even as good as a hooker

因为行政命令可以把你律师一切给否掉
Because the executive order can deny everything of you as a lawyer

他没有尊严的
you would have no dignity

在中国人的律师就是花钱就可以买的
The lawyers in China can be bought with money

在美国、在英国绝对不可能
but it is absolutely impossible in the United States and the United Kingdom

我告诉你
Let me tell you

咱一年花上亿的律师费
We have spent hundreds of millions of legal fees a year

你想让律师替你撒一句谎
Wishing to have a lawyer tell any lie

或者没有事实的辩护，绝对不可能！
or to defend you without facts is absolutely impossible!

在办公室里边长岛哥看到我们最牛叉的就是律师
Long Island (guest speaker) brother has seen that the most awesome individuals in our office are the lawyers

就跟爷似的，比我都牛
just like the kings, they are more powerful than me

可我们中国人把律师真当成啥呀？
But what do CCP Chinese really think of lawyers?

比小姐都都不如，小姐得付钱呢
It’s not even as good as a hooker, which can at least get money

律师有时候律师费还不付
The lawyers sometimes don’t get paid for legal fees

律师找业主追律师费，这是中国的普遍现象，还要打折
It is a common phenomenon in China that lawyers seek legal fees from their client, and there are also discounts

在外国你是不可能的
In a foreign country, it’s impossible

这就是东弟讲的核心
This is the core of what Hao Haidong brother said

这是法律，绝不可改
It’s the law and absolutely cannot be changed

还有刚才讲那个英国
Also, about the UK

这又是他牛的地方
This is his (Hao Haidong) another awesomeness

你看他说注意到重点了吧？
See what he said which had paid attention to the key points

我们爆料革命到今天说的
What we have said since our whistleblower movement till today

只要美国作出决定
as long as the United States makes a decision

咱从疫苗开始
let’s start with the vaccine

我说只要美国动了
I said that as long as the United States moves

全世界都跟, 没有选择的
the whole world will follow, and there is no choice

这个世界上，昨天你七嫂问我，多少是美国的同伴、同盟？
Yesterday, my wife asked me, how many companions and allies of the United States are there in this world?

我说世界上200个多个国家
I said more than 200 countries in the world

五分之三的人
and 60% of the population

只要是有钱、有权、有法律的，都是美国的同伴
As long as you have money, power, and laws, you are all companions of the United States

是吧？都是他同伴，都是他同盟国
Am I right? All are his companions, his allies

这是刚才东弟讲的核心呀
This is the core of what Hao Haidong Brother just said earlier
