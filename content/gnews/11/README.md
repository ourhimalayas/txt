**郭文贵
Miles Guo**

她说我孩子在北京和我，我们都买了房子，干了这一二十年
She said that my child and I, we both bought apartments in Beijing and worked there for 10-20 years

然后我们是盘古人，她说我的前30年是在这个小城市活着的
Then we are Pangu people, she said that I lived in this small town for my first 30 years

我的后20年是在盘古跟你一起活着的，我的女儿生下来以后长大18岁以后就是跟盘古活着
I lived in Pangu with you for the last 20 years, after my daughter was born and after she was 18 years old, she grew up with Pangu and lived with Pangu

她说我们一家两代人都买了房子，她说现在我们在北京, 现在想卖房子的时候
She said that two generations of our family have bought apartments, and she said that now we are in Beijing now when we want to sell the house

我们降价卖不让我们卖，而且一家人在过去的时候，郭先生，我就听了你的
We want to sell it at lower price and won’t let us sell it, and Mr. Guo when our family was in the past we listened to you

我们全家买了政泉的房子，也就是付了300块人民币的定金每平方米买了的房子
Our family bought Zhengquan’s house, which means we paid a deposit of RMB 300 per square meter

她说每套房子都赚了2000多万，又听了你七哥的直播，我们把房子给卖了
She said that every house made more than 20 million yuan profits, and after listening to you Miles’s live broadcast, we sold the apartments

我们的钱也都拿回来了，现在我们在外边买的房子就是打折卖没人买
We got money back, and now we want to sell the apartments we bought other place at a discount price and no one buys it

我们两代的房子就没听你没了，她说，不但是我们这样是整个北京
We didn’t listen to you that our two generations’ apartments are gone, she said, not only ours, it is for the whole Beijing’s

但是我问了一下我们四川的老乡，几乎是只要超过500万的房子
But I asked our Sichuan’s fellows, there are almost the apartments that are over 5 million yuan

你挂牌以后，跟那个市场的要价根本不可能，她说，最可怕的是银行
after you list it, it is impossible to ask for the market price, she said that the most terrifying thing is the bank

她说银行在春节前还让我们跟它做假账，什么还贷款
She said that before the Spring Festival, the bank asked us to make false accounts with them, and like repay the loan

你多给我点儿钱，我借给点钱，你给我充什么贷款
all the banks rush performance, and desperately urging me to borrow money etc.

她说一堆复杂的东西，更重要的事情，我们这位战友的娘说了一句话
She said a lot of complicated things, more important things, this comrade-in-arms’ mother said a word

她说你知道我在外面老家现在发生什么，我们在老家的房子
She said you know what is happening in my hometown, our apartments in my hometown

现在政府登记完以后，马上要求你，答应像咱们锁币币加锁一样
Now that after the government has finished registering, it will ask you immediately and promise to be like we freeze Hcoins

他们叫房加锁，3到5年内不能卖，因为你曾经有过三套房
Apartments cannot be sold for 3 to 5 years, because you once owned three houses

现在房子3年锁房，而且银行给你的造假
Now the house is freeze for 3 years, and the bank gives you a fraudulent paperwork

提前交3年物业管理费, 银行贷给你的物业管理费
pay the property management fee for 3 years in advance and the bank lends your property management fees

房地产现在是共产党(想)捂住捂不住的
now the Communist Party want to cover up the real estate’s collapse and it can’t

在裤裆下那个大窟窿了，这是个天大的事情
this is a big hole in the crotch, this is a big deal

房地产会毁掉两代人、三代人、四代人，或者你成为房奴
Real estate’s collapse will destroy two, three, or four generations, or you will become the house slave
