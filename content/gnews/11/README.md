郭文贵

共产党一个发改委的能源局局长想弄100亿
The head of the Energy Bureau of the Development and Reform Commission of the Communist Party wants to get 10 billion dollars

就像你们现在赚个1千块钱那么简单，张宏伟跟能源局副局长吃一顿饭
It’s as simple as you earn 1,000 dollars now, Zhang Hongwei had a meal with the deputy director of the Bureau of Energy

当天晚上张宏伟在香港，把那个江诗丹顿的所有的收藏版的表买过去
at that night Zhang Hongwei was in Hong Kong, he bought all the collector’s edition watches of Vacheron Constantin

当时拿过去的时候是拿了两亿美元的支票放在那儿押着
He took a 200 million U.S. dollars check and put it in the store

如果是我都买了，我们用支票，不买了就（把表）送回去
If I wanted them, then just cashed the check otherwise I would send the watches back

结果拿过去一块也没拿回来，两亿支票兑现
Then they didn’t send any single watch back, the check was cashed

全都是江诗丹顿特别版，能源局局长喜欢表
all the watches are Vacheron Constantin special editions, the Director of the Energy Bureau likes watches

记住我今天郭文贵说的话，
Remember what I, Guo Wengui said today

如果这个能源局的局长，发改委副主任被抓
If this director of the Energy Bureau and the deputy director of the Development and Reform Commission was arrested

他家的表最起码在3千-4千块之间，而且都是世界上最顶级的
His watches are at least between 3,000 and 4,000 pieces, and they are all the top class in the world

3千多块，没有一块低于10万美元的，算算多少钱
All these 3,000 pieces, each of them was not below $100,000 dollars, how much were them totally?

这是发改委有多牛，你知道吗？发改委是你们不知道的，
This is how powerful the National Development and Reform Commission is, do you know? You don’t know anything about the Development and Reform Commission

中国发改委，财政部，中纪委这是捞大钱的
China Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Finance, Central Commission for Discipline Inspection are all big money grubbers

然后是银监会，保监会，证监会这几个会，这是真的赚钱的呀
Then there are the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, they are really profitable commissions

其他的都是另外一回事，房地产谁控制的，银监会和保监会控制，这几个会控制呢
Everything else is another matter, which commission controls the real estate,
is controlled by the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, these commissions control it

所以说兄弟姐妹们这次大停电，是国内政治经济利益大较量的结果
Therefore, brothers and sisters, the blackout is the result of a great contest of domestic political and economic interests

习家说这不关我的事儿，老子我得要政治利益，我得要政治面子，再个也没钱
Xi’s family said that it’s nothing to do with me, I have to have political benefits and looking good politically, and also there is no money

所有的人都认为老百姓没电，像那在高空中头朝下的
Everyone thinks that the common people have no electricity, like some one is working headed down high in the sky

还有在那个东北医院里边正在做手术呢，吧唧停电了，完了
also there was an operation in that Northeast Hospital, right? The power went out, it’s over
