**郭文贵
Miles Guo**

特别的感谢刚才飞飞, 还有Eglise医生, 还有我们青蒿素讨论群
Special thanks to Feifei, Dr. Eglise, and our artemisinin discussion group

所有的医生们承担了巨大的风险，没有任何一分回报
All the doctors have taken huge risks without any rewards

日以继夜地在工作
and are working day and night

救多少人大家知道
We all know that how many people have been saved

像Eglise为代表的，太重要了
As represented by Eglise, they are all very important

你像飞飞这个患病之后
Just like Feifei

从得病期间到最后恢复
from the time of illness to her final recovery

从来没休息过
she didn’t rest at all

就是全力以赴的在救人
and did her best to save others

Omicron现在看来就是我们一定要纠正
Now it seems that we have to make corrections to the opinion of Omicron

这Omicron的危险性比我们想象的大得多得多
This Omicron is way more dangerous than we thought

它诞生它造成的所有的综合症比我们想象的大得多得多
It comes and all the syndromes it causes are much more serious than we thought

就是这个绝对超出大家的想象这个Omicron
This Omicron is absolutely beyond everyone’s thought

那么现在在西方和全世界，爆料革命，就是这个Isabella杨坚决不报道的
So now the whistleblower movement in the West and the whole world is what Isabella Yang determined not to report

第一个
First

我们在去年就告诉大家
we have told you last year

病毒绝对没有疫苗对人类的威胁大
that the viruses are definitely not as threatening to humans as the vaccines

疫苗灾难才是真正的次生灾难
The vaccine disaster is a real disaster following the virus disaster

是人类最大的灾难
It’s the biggest disaster in humanity

而且我们一再说
And we have said that again and again

今年年底，2021年年底才是真正的灾难的开始
that at the end of this year, the end of 2021 is the beginning of the real disaster

病毒大扩散
in which the virus would mass spread

没有一个人说，就我们
Not anyone but us has said that

今年我们说的真的不下万遍吧
We have said that not less than 10,000 times this year, right?

就是说我说10月到12月大爆发
In other words, what I said was a big outbreak from October to December

而且来自于非洲和（美洲）西部
and it was from Africa and western America

我们全（说）准了
Everything we had said is correct

而且我说感恩节之后，美国及世界大爆发
And I said that there would be a big outbreak in the United States and worldwide after Thanksgiving

大家看到了吗？
Did you see it?

全美国、全世界都在（爆发）感恩节是最夸张的
The United States and the world have outbreaks, especially after Thanksgiving

最后又是我们（说准了）
In the end, we are correct again

不是我们蒙出来的
We didn’t make that up

这是我们的科学家和背后的爆料革命
This is our scientists and the whistleblower movement in the back

深知这是个生化武器和共产党内部要决策的情报
knowing that this is a biochemical weapon, and it’s the intel information for the CCP’s internal decision-making

在冬奥会前让西方经济要垮下来，让西方要内乱
which is making the western economically collapse and internally disorder before the Winter Olympics

然后无暇顾及（中共）
that way, they have no time to pay attention to the CCP

就像现在习近平、王岐山、杨洁篪、王毅、王沪宁在内部说的
Just like Xi Jinping, Wang Qishan, Yang Jiechi, Wang Yi, and Wang Huning have said internally

一定会打赢这次中美世纪大战
they would definitely win the Sino-US war of the century

这是他原话啊，“一定要有信心，而且一定会打赢中美的世纪大战”
This is what he has said exactly, “We must have confidence and will win the Sino-U.S. war of the century”

这都是这个结果
All these are the result of it

这几天兄弟姐妹们, 你们一定要意识到
Brothers and sisters these days, you must be aware

Omicron太可怕了
The Omicron is terrible and serious

而且不好的现象是Omicron现在发现吃了伊维菌素和青蒿素有些不是100%管用
And the bad phenomenon is now finds that ivermectin and artemisinin somewhat are not 100% effective against Omicron
