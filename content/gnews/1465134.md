油管用户[Dr. John Campbell](https://www.youtube.com/@Campbellteaching) （John Campbell博士）在2023年[[zh:7月16日]]发布了他与[[zh:丹麦]][[zh:科学家]]Dr. Vibeke Manniche（Vibeke Manniche博士）连线讨论2022年以来在[[zh:欧洲]]存在的过度死亡问题的视频：[Excess deaths, the silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtkfPWddQtY)（过量死亡和沉默）

以下为John Campbell博士与Vibeke Manniche博士连线访谈中文大意：

**John Campbell博士**：嗯，欢迎来到这次讲座，我很高兴再次欢迎来自[[zh:丹麦]]的Vibek Manniche。欢迎你，Vibeke。感谢你的回来。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：非常感谢再次邀请我，John。

**John Campbell博士**：现在是[[zh:关于]]过度死亡的严重问题。现在，我们一直在看到[[zh:欧洲]]和世界各地的过度死亡。当然，在2020年，由于[[zh:疫情]]，我们预计会出现这种情况。在2021年，同样，你会预计这是[[zh:疫情]]所致。但我们看到的是，这些过度死亡持续到了2022年。现在，我们并不真的预期会出现这种情况，因为当我们出现了Omicron变种时，COVID-19的死亡人数大幅下降，该变种的致病性要低得多，而且人们正在获得很多免疫力。但实际上，过度死亡情况持续到了2023年。例如，在[[zh:英国]]，在截至[[zh:6月30日]]的那一周，仍然有8.6%的过度死亡。现在，我知道你正在计划进行一些[[zh:关于]]此问题的研究，以获取真实的数据和确切的数字，但是最初是什么引起了你的兴趣呢？Vibeke。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：首先，我必须说，我们在2020年没有过度死亡。我的意思是，在2020年，我们并没有过度死亡。是的，我们有一些有和没有[[zh:新冠病毒]]的死亡，但实际上并没有过度死亡。有趣的是，一群[[zh:科学家]]、医生和统计学家从一开始就一直在关注数据，从2020年[[zh:2月28日]]，我们有了[[zh:新冠病毒]]。我们一直在研究这些数据，无论我们是否会有过度死亡，这仅仅是基[[zh:于丹]]麦的数据。我对[[zh:英国]]的数据并不是很了解。我现在有一些有关过度死亡的数据，但从一开始我并没有太关注这些数据。所以在2020年，我们没有过度死亡，但是发生了一些奇怪的事情，而且我还没有一个解释。在2021年[[zh:5月21日]]，过度死亡开始了，这在[[zh:丹麦]]以及[[zh:芬兰]]和[[zh:挪威]]也是如此。就好像它发生在一个特定的日期。问题是，当我们实施封锁措施时，我对任何愿意倾听的人说的第一件事就是这将会造成生命的损失。因为一旦关闭医疗系统，关闭医院和从业人员，一旦关闭了，就会导致延迟诊断、延迟治疗、延迟康复等问题。所以，在那个时候，我预计在一年半的时间里，我们会有过度死亡。但实际上，我们在这之前就已经有了。从2021年[[zh:5月21日]]开始，在[[zh:丹麦]]和其他几个地方，过度死亡情况一直持续下去。这非常奇怪，也非常令人沮丧。因此，我们一直在研究和关注这些数据，你在那里有一个图表，我认为非常有趣。因为你可以看到是同样的模式。作为一名医生，谈论预防以及如何预防发病和死亡，如何让人们过上长寿、健康和充实的生活，对我来说真的非常非常沮丧，从一旁观察这一切，并研究这些数据，你只会看到它持续下去。

如果你看看这些图表，你会看到[[zh:丹麦]]、[[zh:芬兰]]、[[zh:挪威]]以及底部的[[zh:英国]]的数据。从这些数据来看，就像你所说的，你们在2020年也出现了一些过度死亡。如果你看看[[zh:丹麦]]的数据，你会发现在2020年，情况还可以，没有什么可谈论的。然后在2021年初有一点起色，然后下降，我们仔细研究了日期，并想着，“嗯，那挺好的。”但是，从[[zh:5月21日]]开始，情况就突然升高了，最近才停止。这是累积的数据，所以如果我们看[[zh:丹麦]]的数据，至少有60,000人死亡，超出预期。60,000人，这是一个约有5,600万公民的人口。但有趣的是，这不仅仅是[[zh:丹麦]]的现象。[[zh:芬兰]]也是如此，[[zh:挪威]]也是如此。你可以看到几乎就像是复制了图表一样。

**John Campbell博士**：[[zh:芬兰]]的死亡情况直到2021年中期才开始。

确切地说是[[zh:5月21日]]。我的意思是，这就像是我们坐在不同的地方，看着同样的事情发生。[[zh:挪威]]也是一样，然后过度死亡情况就持续上升。

**John Campbell博士**：是的。

**John Campbell博士**：这就是为什么，如果我作为一名[[zh:流行病学家]]看到这种情况，我会期待，“好吧，你们是抄袭了什么吗？你们拿的是当时发生的情况的数据吗？”但这只是显示了[[zh:疫情]]处理有多糟糕。对我来说，这是人为造成的。对我来说，这是[[zh:政府]]和当局对公众施加的人道危机的迹象，因为这与[[zh:新冠病毒]]本身无关。这与所发生的处理方式有关。

如果你看到[[zh:英国]]的数据，我想过度死亡人数大约有15万，这是一个可怕的数字，因为正如我一直说的，这些都是名字。这些人的离去让某人仍然在哭泣、仍然在思念，仍然伤心，等等。所以，这些都是有名字的人。我认为也许最糟糕的部分是，我们实际上没有被允许讨论这种过度死亡。每当你想公开讨论时，[[zh:主流媒体]]就把它压下去。不，不要提。让我们假装它不存在。但它确实存在，而且是真实的。你可以看到数据，这不仅仅是[[zh:丹麦]]的问题。这不仅仅是[[zh:芬兰]]的问题。我们刚刚从[[zh:德国]]得到了一个非常出色的研究，显示他们也有并且仍然存在过度死亡。他们的过度死亡人数比[[zh:丹麦]]还多。所以，这是一个巨大的人道危机，真的，对我来说非常令人恐惧，作为一名医生，我认为这非常令人恐惧。

**John Campbell博士**：我之前没有注意到这个趋势。所以在[[zh:英国]]，过度死亡情况始于2020年。在[[zh:丹麦]]、[[zh:芬兰]]和[[zh:挪威]]，直到2021年中期才开始。你有什么初步的解释来解释这种差异吗？

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：嗯，肯定有一些与人口统计学有关的因素。这与生活方式有关，与医疗系统的运作方式有关，与富人和穷人有关，等等。我的意思是，肯定有一些因素。但是当你观察[[zh:挪威]]、[[zh:芬兰]]和[[zh:丹麦]]的数据时，我们在人口统计学、寿命等方面与斯堪的纳维亚[[zh:国家]]相似。所以，我认为这更具可比性。因此，斯堪的纳维亚数据显示出一些差异。因为在[[zh:英国]]，我也一直在关注这个讨论。可能有很多解释，是这样还是那样，我们有没有在这方面有所削减，发生了什么？但当你看斯堪的纳维亚地区的情况时，这不是随机的。这不是像“哎呀，突然发生了什么”的情况。这是非随机的。这与所发生的事情有关。根据我的估计，这是多因素的。这不仅仅是一个因素在起作用。而且我非常确定，我们已经从研究中得知，如果你延迟治疗，如果你没有得到治疗，就像我们在[[zh:心脏]]病发作时所看到的那样，你会受到更严重的[[zh:心脏]]损伤。最终，这会导致[[zh:心力衰竭]]，最终导致早逝。所以，我们对于过度死亡也有一些合理的解释，就像你们在[[zh:英国]]所拥有的数据一样。这显示了封锁的代价。那是肯定的。当你关闭医疗系统，当你拿走救护车，当人们不去接受[[zh:心脏]]病发作的治疗，他们待在家里，以为自己不被允许来，或者他们害怕[[zh:新冠病毒]]，无论是什么原因。

如果他们去医院，他们是不允许有家属陪伴的。我们知道，在经历严重疾病时，有亲人在身边非常重要，有人给你爱，照顾你，安慰你，确保你得到治疗等等。但他们被拒绝进入医院。所以，我认为这有很多原因，这就是为什么我称之为人为制造的危机，这种过度死亡。这也是为什么我认为讨论、学习和抓住它非常重要，因为那是下一个问题。我们到底能做什么来阻止这种发展？从图表上也可以看出，似乎我们已经在[[zh:丹麦]]、[[zh:挪威]]和[[zh:芬兰]]停止了这种情况。但是，我们从中学到了什么？发生了什么？我们如何确保不会再次发生？所以，我还认为其中一部分可能是由于[[zh:孤独]]、社交孤立、精神疾病、自杀，然后最终我们也在讨论一些过度死亡是否可以通过[[zh:疫苗]]来解释，我不是说它是这样的，但也许可以通过[[zh:疫苗]]来解释。我们还不知道。

所以，我们肯定知道其中一部分是封锁和关闭医疗系统的代价。对于那些可能还怀疑这一点的人，我一直在说：“如果你认为我们不需要医疗系统，就像它正常运作时那样，那么为什么还要建立医疗系统呢？”你知道，如果你认为通过关闭医疗系统、关闭大门，只接收急症病人等等，你就可以得到相同的结果，那么为什么要建立一个庞大的医疗系统呢？你知道，这实际上是胡说八道，无法成立，但说或假装不认为这并不重要。我看到[[zh:英国]][[zh:心脏]]协会也有类似的解释，所以没问题。但[[zh:关于]][[zh:疫苗]]的问题仍然不清楚。这是一个有趣的事情，因为如果你回头看图表，[[zh:约翰]]，你会发现我们在[[zh:疫苗]]开始的那条线。你看到这条线，这只是为了...我们在制作图表的过程中一直这样做，也是在[[zh:冠状病毒]]危机期间。当某些事情发生时，你知道，当某些事情发生变化时，无论它是什么，这总是令人感兴趣的。这就是为什么我们把它放进图表中的原因，因为有人会认为过度死亡也与[[zh:疫苗]]有关。我不是说是这样的，因为我们还没有任何数据，至少在[[zh:丹麦]]我们没有数据，证明它是或不是。所以，这只是推测。但当然，这也是明显要考虑的，特别是考虑到我们自己的研究，我们发现一些[[zh:疫苗]]批次似乎引起了更多的副作用，这可能证明一些批次可能存在安全问题。如果确实存在安全问题，就像我们的研究显示的那样，一些批次引起了更多的副作用，那么当然，你可以预期可能会有更高的全因[[zh:死亡率]]，我们正在努力研究这个问题。但我仍然认为，我回到这一点，但我仍然认为看到[[zh:疫苗]]开始和持续之间的接近非常有趣。我们必须记住，持续了第一、二、三次[[zh:疫苗]]接种。所以，这种过度死亡实际上也紧随[[zh:疫苗]]开始和持续接种。但再说一次，我要非常重要地强调，我并不是说[[zh:疫苗]]导致了过度死亡。我只是说，不考虑这一点也是错误的。这就是为什么我一直在说，并不仅仅是一个解释。过度死亡绝对不是一个原因，而是有很多原因。

**John Campbell博士**：是的，你认为后续COVID病症也可能是长期死亡的一部分，实际上是由于COVID感染造成的器官损伤吗？

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：嗯，一切皆有可能。但根据我们从研究中所了解的情况来看，那不过是，我是说，你必须记住我们也有后流感。人们也会出现类似的情况，你知道，出现长期的，现在我们有了长期COVID，但我们也有了长期流感。人们也会出现流感的副作用，情况会越来越糟糕。所以我仍然期望，它会更或多或少地呈现与流感季节或流感大流行时类似的模式。不，不完全是这样。但我想说的是，它是多因素的。但有一件事是确定的，我们已经从[[zh:心脏]]病发作的数据中知道，当我们实施封锁措施并且发生[[zh:心脏]]病发作时，[[zh:心脏]]的损害至少比封锁措施外的情况严重了25%。这证实了[[zh:心脏]]病需要治疗，如果[[zh:心脏]]受到如此严重的损害，你会更早死亡。所以，这就像[[zh:癌症]]一样，同样的故事，人们没有得到治疗和诊断。当然，如果你的诊断被延迟，治疗被延迟，你会早死。所以，我只是说我们必须研究这个问题，但这必须是透明的和开放的讨论。

而这正是缺失的，确实如此。因为当数据如此多变时，你可以看看我们刚刚展示的这些数据，John。这些都是官方数据。这不是我们刻意为之的数据。这些都是真实的数据。当它们如此明显时，当然，我们需要进行这样的讨论。我们要求进行这样的讨论来拯救生命，阻止继续发生，并尽我们所能拯救人们。因为现在在[[zh:英国]]，人们正在无缘无故地死去，我可以这样说。但他们不应该这样，因为这太多了。

**John Campbell博士**：继你们出色的[[zh:关于]][[zh:疫苗]]批次的论文之后，你们是否计划使用类似的研究方法来研究过度死亡？

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：是的，我们已经在继续进行了。首先，我们正在更新我们的数据，看看是否有新的数据可以加入，并查看模式是否仍然存在。看起来有三种不同的副作用方式。某些批次倾向于引起轻微副作用，其他批次则较少，还有一些批次则没有。所以，我们正在研究这个问题。但我们也试图研究全因[[zh:死亡率]]，看是否会有预期的情况，我并不是说一定会有，特别是现在已经过了一段时间，如果人们接种了报告副作用较多的蓝色批次，那么他们可能会有更高的[[zh:死亡率]]。所以，我们正在努力获取这些数据。但我必须承认，我们遇到了一些数据提供方的骚扰。他们试图阻止我们获取数据。但最终，我们将获得这些数据，因为我们有权获得这些数据。我们正在研究这个问题，并且非常渴望获得这些数据，这样我们就可以整理并看看是否会发现这种模式或不发现这种模式。这就是[[zh:科学]]的本质。我们需要数据。我们需要真实的数字，否则我们只能凭猜测。我现在只是在猜测可能会有一个模式，但我们需要对其进行记录，或者相反，显示这种情况并不是这样。

**John Campbell博士**：你并不是在猜测，你是在提出一个假设。我认为重要的是要提到，假设是一种可检验的陈述。是的，对于这个假设是可以检验的，我们可以进一步测试。因为一个假设可能是，那些来自产生更多副作用的批次的人，在我们进行纵向跟踪时，我们预计他们会因为[[zh:组织]]损伤而发展出更多后遗症。但当然，这只是一个假设。我们必须根据实际数据进行测试。是的，这是一个更好和更适当的解释方式。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：你说得很对。 所以，无论什么假设，它都是一个假设。

**John Campbell博士**：我很高兴我们没有用[[zh:丹麦]]语进行这次采访。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：不，确实如此。我很感激。对我来说会更容易一些。不，但你说得对。这是正确的说法，当然这就是我们在做的，当然也是我们进行这项研究的论据。正如你自己所说的，人们可能不会立刻看到结果，也许需要一年或两年，但人们可能会预期，或者至少这也是假设，接种蓝色批次的人将会有更高的全因[[zh:死亡率]]。但是，如果我说这是事实的话是错误的，因为我们仍然没有那些数据。这就是为什么我们试图获得那些数据，最终测试这个假设。

**John Campbell博士**：所以，我们需要把数据提供给你，然后你可以测试这个假设，你可以说，你知道吗，我们完全错了。这些人已经完全康复了。或者你可以说，看，这个假设得到了证实。这些人死亡速度更快，并且出现了更多的后遗症。在我们获得数据之前，我们无法说出结论。事实上，这不是对错的问题。数据要么支持，要么反驳假设。这里没有情感。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：是的，我认为我们确实必须这样做。就我看来，这是一个需求。我们对一个明显的猜测有这个想法。所以，我认为我们被要求继续，我也认为，最终，当局应该调查此事。我认为这实际上是一件事情，你知道，我是说，我们已经能够做到这一点。我们已经在过去的三年半里做到了这一点。我们一直在业余时间或免费时间里研究这些数据。但是确实，我们有人每月拿薪水做这项工作。我认为这相当令人沮丧，或者说令人伤心，或者说令人，你知道，我不知道哪个词是正确的，令人失望。因为正如我之前所说的，这实际上正在夺走生命。这可能是你的家人，这可能是我们世界上最爱的人，这可能是我们自己。我认为这对人口是如此巨大的威胁。如果你看到花了多少精力，花了多少钱，你知道，在这疯狂的[[zh:冠状病毒]]恐慌中，无论需要付出什么代价，我认为在[[zh:丹麦]]，你知道，数十亿都被用在了所有这些事情上，你知道，实际上在[[zh:丹麦]]，几乎没有发生任何事情，至少在[[zh:死亡率]]方面。而在这里，你有一个机会，你有一个明显的，一个显而易见的过度死亡，而似乎没有人在乎。这就更加，我们生活在一个疯狂的世界中，因为人们在死去，人们失去了他们所爱的人，而似乎没有人在乎。这真的很奇怪，这就是为什么我说，最终，当局应该认真调查这个问题。他们已经掌握了那些数据，这就是他们的工作。确切地说，确切地说。这也是我们的税金所用的，所以我们实际上应该期望他们这样做。但我们非常愿意去做，并继续我们的工作，但我仍然认为，应该有人，作为他们的工作的一部分，已经在做这个工作了。

现在，我提出了一个假设，即会有一个模式，但我们需要有相关记录，或者反过来，证明这不是真的。

**John Campbell博士**：你并不是在猜测，你是在提出一个假设，我认为重要的是要提到，假设是一个可检验的陈述。是的，对于这个假设是可以进行检验的，我们可以继续测试。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：绝对是这样。

**John Campbell博士**：因为一个假设可能是，那些在更多批次中出现更多不良反应的人，在纵向研究中，如果我们对这些人进行纵向追踪，他们可能会出现更多的后遗症，例如[[zh:组织]]损伤。但当然，这只是一个假设，我们必须根据实际数据进行测试。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：是的，这是一种更好、更正确的解释方式。 你说得很对。 所以，这只是一个假设。

**John Campbell博士**：我很高兴我们没有用[[zh:丹麦]]语进行这次采访。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：不，确切地说。 我很感激。 至少对我来说会更容易。 但你是对的。 所以，这是正确的表达方式，当然，这也是我们正在做的事情。 当然，这就是我们这样做的理由。 正如您自己所说，人们会期望，也许不是现在，也许在一两年内，但人们会期望，或者至少，这也是如此，将会有更高的全因[[zh:死亡率]]到蓝色批次。 但如果我这么说那就错了，因为我们还没有这些数据。 这就是为什么我们试图获取这些数据，当然最终也会如此。

**John Campbell博士**：所以，我们需要把数据提供给你。然后，你可以测试这个假设，你可以说：“你知道吗，我们完全错了。这些人已经完全康复了。”或者你可以说：“看，这个假设得到了证实。这些人死亡速度更快，并且出现了更多的后遗症。”在我们获得数据之前，我们无法下结论。事实上，这不是对错的问题。数据要么支持，要么反驳假设。这里没有情感，没有。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：我认为我们真的必须这样做。我的意思是，我认为有需求。我们对一个明显的猜测有这个想法。所以，我认为我们有义务去做。我们应该继续。并且，最后，我真的认为当局应该调查这个问题。我认为这实际上是一件，你知道，我是说，我们已经能够做到这一点。我们已经这样做了，你知道，过去三年半我们一直在研究这些数据，你知道，在我们的业余时间，或者，你知道，全免费地。但是确实，我们有人每月拿薪水做这个工作。我认为，你知道，我认为这相当令人沮丧，或者说令人伤心，或者说令人，你知道，我不知道哪个词是正确的。

**John Campbell博士**：令人失望。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：令人失望，确切地说，令人失望，他们没有这样做，因为正如我之前所说的，这实际上正在夺走生命。我的意思是，这可能是你的家人。这可能是我们世界上最爱的人。这可能是我们自己。我认为这对整个人口是如此巨大的威胁。如果你看到花了多少精力，花了多少钱，你知道，在这疯狂的[[zh:冠状病毒]]恐慌中，无论需要付出什么代价，我认为在[[zh:丹麦]]，你知道，数十亿都被用在了所有这些事情上，你知道，在至少在[[zh:死亡率]]方面，在[[zh:丹麦]]，实际上没有发生什么。而在这里，你有一个机会，你有一个明显的过度死亡，而似乎没有人在乎。这更加，我们生活在一个疯狂的世界中。好吧，因为，人们在死去，人们失去了他们，你知道，所爱的人，而似乎没有人在乎。这真的非常奇怪。这就是为什么我说，最后，当局应该认真研究这些数据，因为他们已经掌握了那些数据。

**John Campbell博士**：这也是他们的职责所在。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：确切地说，绝对是这样的。这是，你知道，我们的纳税钱所用的，所以我们实际上应该期望他们这样做。但是，我们非常愿意去做，并继续我们的工作。但是，我仍然认为，应该有人，作为他们工作的一部分，一直在做这个工作，并继续做下去。但是，事实并非如此。

**John Campbell博士**：而你们不必为了获取数据而战斗，而你们必须为了获取数据而战斗。那么，你是...

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：我认为在这一点上，是的，我认为这是骚扰。这是一种骚扰，你知道，这是正确的说法。我们可以从他们的行为中看出，就是[[zh:丹麦]]机构，我们可以看到他们的行为，他们试图骚扰我们的工作。实际上，这真的很令人恶心，就好像这是他们自己的，嗯，自己的数据，不，这是公共数据。他们只是负责处理和管理。所以，我认为，但另一方面，这是因为我们的研究实际上指出，那些负责安全问题和安全疾病的人没有正确地完成这项工作。这似乎是他们试图骚扰我们的原因。但是最终，当然，我们有权获得这些数据。我们只是在等待获取这些数据，因为我们可以很容易地开始进行统计分析，然后继续下去，看看是否会发生什么，或者就像你之前说的，推翻那种组合或者联系。那也没关系。这就是[[zh:科学]]的本质。你提出一个假设，你有一个想法，你测试它，它要么正确，要么错误。这就是为什么我们都非常渴望获得数据，也依赖于未来的公共卫生。

**John Campbell博士**：你是否有信心，随着时间的推移，你能够获取到有关[[zh:接种疫苗]]和未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的人员数据，以及人们接种了多少剂[[zh:疫苗]]、出现了哪些不良反应，以及有哪些长期的发病率和[[zh:死亡率]]，并能够将这两个变量进行关联？换句话说，我们将来是否会知道这个问题的答案？

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：哦，是的，我非常确定我们会知道的。这只是时间的问题，因为他们无法将这些数字和数据留给我们。不，不，所以他们不被允许这样做。所以最终我们会获得，而且从我们已经拥有的数据中，我们现在正在试图更深入地研究质量，看看我们是否能够观察到一些不良[[zh:事件]]的批次，哪些批次引起[[zh:心肌炎]]，哪些批次引起更多的耳鸣，是否有一些批次引起更多的肌肉疼痛等等。所以我们已经有了大量的数据，我们可以进一步具体研究，并看看是否能够观察到症状的模式等等。所以我们还有很多数据可以研究。我们有大量的数据，但是这就是这种全因[[zh:死亡率]]，特别是现在这种明显的过度[[zh:死亡率]]，因为在五[[zh:六月]]份，然后你期望，"好吧，[[zh:七月]]份，也许会下降"，但正如我们在图表中看到的，它只是继续，现在趋于平稳。所以现在这是如此明显，我们迫切需要这些数据，无论是确认这种情况还是相反，不，那并非如此。我们都渴望得到这两个答案。所以我非常确定，最终我们会获得这些数据。但是，这种骚扰非常令人沮丧。我们之前谈到过这一点。这是如此令人沮丧，如此不公平，如此不[[zh:科学]]。就像我之前解释的那样，[[zh:科学家]]之间通常保持着非常礼貌的态度，而对于某些奇怪的原因，就只有那个地方和那个电影学院的一位教授如此无礼，如此难以理解他们为什么会这样行事。但是再怎么说，我们不能因为这样而放弃获得数据。所以我们会获得这些数据。这是肯定的。但是这真的令人沮丧。

**John Campbell博士**：随着时间的推移，我们将能够将[[zh:疫苗]]剂量和批次与疾病和发病率进行关联，我们将得到正相关、负相关或无相关的结果。但迟早我们会得到答案。一旦建立了这种相关性，实验室的人就需要提出[[zh:关于]]这一点的病理学解释，即[[zh:生物]]学解释。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：是的，完全正确，这是下一步。如果有些过度[[zh:死亡率]]也与[[zh:疫苗]]有关，那么当然人们为什么会死亡？是由于[[zh:癌症]]吗？是[[zh:心肌炎]]吗？是[[zh:心力衰竭]]吗？是各种[[zh:心脏]]问题吗？当然，这是下一个解释。实际上发生了什么？是突然死亡综合征吗？人们一直在死亡，当然，但是，是否会有一种模式？是否与[[zh:刺突蛋白]]有关？是否与这些蛋白在特定器官中的堆积有关？这一切，我们可以得到解释。所以我一直在说，这都是一些使徒，所以最终会形成一个更大的图景。而且，我认为，如果你看看[[zh:辉瑞]]等[[zh:公司]]，我认为他们应该研究这些数据。他们……

**John Campbell博士**：我怀疑他们正在研究这些数据，只是他们可能没有告诉我们。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：不，不，他们可能正在研究，但他们应该研究。我们对获取这些数据有需求和渴望。但尽管如此，我们有公共数据，相当说来，我们可以开始研究，看看是否存在与全因[[zh:死亡率]]相关的联系，正如我之前所说的。其他[[zh:科学家]]也可以做同样的事情。我是说，没有人说这一切只取决于我们的继续工作。我很乐意如果其他人也有这些研究并发表结果，因为我们获取的数据越多，我们就能看到我们从[[zh:丹麦]]、[[zh:芬兰]]、[[zh:挪威]]的数据中学到了多少。我们在不同[[zh:国家]]之间进行比较，我们就能看到一种模式。因为如果你和我今天只有一张图表，比[[zh:如来]]自[[zh:丹麦]]，那么有人可能会说，“嗯，那可能是[[zh:丹麦]]人不知道如何生活，所以他们都死了。”你懂的。

**John Campbell博士**：所以基本上，很明显是[[zh:丹麦]]啤酒引起的。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：没错，就是这个意思。他们喝得太多了，等等。但是当你看到突然不同的[[zh:国家]]，你看到这种模式，你突然会说，“天哪，这里发生了一些奇怪的事情。”所以我们从[[zh:丹麦]]的数据、[[zh:英国]]的数据中学到了很多。我对[[zh:英国]][[zh:国家]]统计局很满意，因为他们发布的内容比[[zh:丹麦]]当局多得多。

**John Campbell博士**：虽然并不完美，但比没有要好。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：是的，比起我们几年前只能获取到的[[zh:丹麦]]数据，这要好得多，而且有很大的延迟。但尽管如此，我们不断从所有这些数据中学习，并最终得出一个完整的图景。这就是一切的意义。

**John Campbell博士**：非常感谢你的工作，Vibeke。我知道这是一项自我牺牲的工作，因为你们这样的人通过克服阻力，坚持工作，最终我们将得到这些问题的答案，让我感到非常放心。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：绝对是这样的。

**John Campbell博士**：通过良好的[[zh:科学]]过程，使用有效、既定的[[zh:科学]]技术。完全正确，这些都是存在的。嗯，可惜人们没有更多地帮助，说，“看，这是你的数据。”他们应该走到你的门口，把数据交给你。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：确实，他们应该站在那里，迫不及待地把数据交给我们，并恳求我们尽快查看数据。还有[[zh:政治]]家们，因为我认为他们的沉默也很有趣。你知道，如果我是一个投身[[zh:政治]]的[[zh:政治]]家，为了拯救世界，拯救人类，你知道，所有这些，我也会敲门说：“噢，请把数据交给他们，尽快给出答案，明天甚至更好，你知道，昨天就好了。让我们做些事情。”但他们也沉默不语，这让我很惊讶，真是疯狂。我真的无法理解，因为我认为很多人和你我有着相同的动力，他们进入[[zh:政治]]或成为医生的原因也是如此。但我真的无法理解，正如你所说，为什么他们不敲门说：“噢，请给他们这些数据，看看吧，让我们看看答案。”而是反而锁上了门，试图让你安静下来，试图骚扰你，诽谤你，所有这些。我，你知道，我真的无法理解。

**John Campbell博士**：嗯，我认为你在那里非常慷慨，但我会复制[[zh:政治]]家的动机。但我们确实相信，有些人真正希望成为公仆，所以让我们希望这些人站出来，能够掌握...

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：也许有些人忘记了，也许有些人忘记了起初的初心。但我仍然相信，我对人类的同胞抱有最好的期望，大多数人都有一个良好的动力，一个好的，就是人们。所以，我认为，但，但另一方面，我无法想象人们每天工作只是为了伤害他人。你知道，我真的无法想象。我是说，可能有一些人这样做，但大多数人会尽力使世界变得更美好。我仍然认为，很多人认为这就是他们所做的。这是他们的动力，或者至少，我希望他们这样做。而现在看起来，好像有人忘记了这一点。就像现在的情况。

**John Campbell博士**：我们需要回到青年时期的理想主义，不是吗？当我们真的想要让世界变得更美好的时候。生活经历可能使你的理想主义受到打击，但我们需要回到那个时期，重新振作起来，真正为了所有人类的利益而努力。你正在这样做。这是一件重要的事情。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：而且，我认为作为一名医生，我一路走来也一直在做这件事，我相信你也会做同样的事情。时不时地提醒自己，为什么我进入这个领域？我的动力是什么？我试图取得什么成就？我试图在哪方面产生影响？我确切地知道我的动力是什么。那就是让更多的人过上幸福的生活，让孩子们过上幸福、长寿和健康的生活，你知道，和他们所爱的人在一起。所以，但你说得对，有时候我们会忘记年轻时的动力，如果我们不时地提醒自己的话。是的，至少，我正在尽力做到这一点。

**John Campbell博士**：绝对是的。 我有最后一个问题要问你，Vibeke，你拿到数据后会回来给我们吗？

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：哦，是的，当然。我很喜欢参加你的节目，John。我觉得很有趣。所以，我很高兴，你知道。不，我必须说，你正在做出巨大的贡献。我知道很多人在观看你的视频，你正在产生巨大的影响。所以，我很高兴能够参加你的节目，我一定会在我有些东西可以与你的观众分享时回来的。所以，我们一定会再次听到我的消息。

**John Campbell博士**：非常感谢。当然，除了帮助他人，这种工作形式，这种分析方式还有一个好处，那就是纯粹的好处。这并不是我们做这个工作的真正原因，但这确实是非常有趣的。所以，这使得工作更容易做。Vibeke，一如既往地，很高兴和你交谈。感谢你所做的一切，我们期待着在你获得确定数据后能够得到一些坚实的数据。我们期待着那一天。谢谢。

**Vibeke Manniche博士**：谢谢。也谢谢你邀请我。

以下为该视频的全英文纪要：

Well, welcome to this talk and I'm delighted to welcome back Vibek Manniche from Denmark. Welcome, Vibek. Thank you for returning.

Thank you very much for having me back, John.

The really serious matter of the excess deaths. Now, we've been seeing excess deaths all throughout Europe and the world. In 2020, of course, you would expect that due to the pandemic. In 2021, again, you would expect that’s the pandemic as well. But what we saw is that these excess deaths carried on into 2022. Now, we wouldn't really expect that because COVID deaths went down dramatically when we had the Omicron variant, which was much less pathogenic, and people were developing a lot of immunity. But the excess deaths are actually continuing into 2023. For example, in the United Kingdom, in the week up to the 30th of June, there were 8.6 excess deaths that are still there. Now, I know you're planning some research on this to get proper data and hard numbers, but what got you interested in this to begin with? Vibek.

Well, first of all, I must say we didn't have excess mortality in 2020. I mean, in 2020, we didn't have excess mortality. Yes, we had some deaths with and without Corona, but we didn't actually have excess mortality. The funny thing is, a group of scientists, doctors, and statisticians have been following the data from day one, from the 28th of February 2020, when we had Corona. We've been looking into the data, and whether we would have, you know this is solely on Danish data.  I'm not that strong on UK data. I have some data now with the excess mortality, but from the beginning, I didn't follow those data that much. So we didn't have excess mortality in 2020, but something happened, and it's very strange, and I still don't have an explanation. May 21st, then the excess mortality started, and that's literally also in Finland and Norway. It's like it's on a date. And the thing is, when we had the lockdown, the first thing I said to anyone who was there to listen was that this will cost lives. Because the minute you close down a health system, the minute you close down the hospitals, the practitioners, the minute you close it down, then you will have delayed diagnosis, delayed treatment, delayed rehabilitation, and so on. So, at that point, I expected that in one and a half years, we would have excess mortality. But we literally had it before. It started in May 21st in Denmark and several other places, and it just continued. And that is very strange and very depressing. So we have been looking into and following these numbers, and you have a graph of that, which I think is very interesting. Because there you can see that it's the same pattern. And as a doctor, talking about prevention and how can you prevent morbidity and mortality, how can you have people live a long and healthy life and fulfill their lives, then that has been, for me as a doctor, really, really depressing to watch this from the side and kind of look into these data, and you just saw it continue.

If you look at the graphs, you can see the numbers in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and at the bottom, you also see the UK. And I can tell from that, as you said, you had some excess mortality also in 2020. If you look at Denmark, you can see in 2020, it was fine, nothing to talk about. Then there was a little start in the beginning of 2021, and then it fell, and we were looking into the dates and thought, "Oh, well, that's fine." But then, in May 21st, it just raised, and just recently, it has stopped. This is accumulated data, so if we look at the Danish data, at least 60,000 people have died, more than expected. Sixty thousand, that's for a population of about 5.6 million citizens. But the interesting part is that this is not only a Danish phenomenon. It's also in Finland, we saw it, in Norway, we saw it. You can see it's almost like you just copied the graph.

The deaths in Finland didn't start until well into 2021.

Exactly May 21st. I mean, it's literally like we've been sitting in different places and watching the same thing happening. And the same happens in Norway as well, and then it just continues up up up with the excess mortality.

Yeah.

And that's why if I saw that as an epidemiologist, you know, I would expect, "Well, did you copy something? Did you take the data from when you know what's happening?" But it just shows how bad the corona handling was. For me, this is man-made. For me, this is a sign of a humanity crisis really put on the public by the governments and the authorities because this has nothing to do with coronavirus as such. This has something to do with the handling of what happened.

And if you saw the UK data, I think it was around 150,000 excess deaths in the UK, and it's a horrific number because, as I keep saying, these are names. These are someone who someone is still crying, still missing, heartbroken, and so on. So, these are people with names. And I think what really maybe the worst part of this is that we haven't really been allowed to discuss this excess mortality. Every time you want to discuss it publicly, mainstream media just keeps it down. No, don't mention it. Let's just put it under the carpet. Let's pretend it's not there. But it is there, and it's for real. And you can look into the data that it's not only a Danish problem. It's not only a problem in Finland. We just had a very excellent study from Germany showing that they also had and still have excess mortality. They have more than we have in Denmark, excess mortality. So, it's a huge humanity crisis, really, and it's quite frightening for me as a doctor. I think it's very frightening.

I haven't noticed this trend before. So in the UK, the excess mortality started in 2020. In Denmark, Finland, and Norway, it didn't start until basically halfway through 2021. Do you have any sort of provisional explanations to explain that difference?

Well, something must have to do, of course, with demography. It has to do with the way of living, has to do with how the health system works, rich and poor, and all that. I mean, something must have. But when you look into the data from Norway, Finland, and Denmark, we're quite similar to Scandinavian countries in terms of demography and how long you live and all that. So, I think that's more comparable, really. And for that reason, the Scandinavian data shows something which is varying. Because in the UK, I've also been following the discussion. There could be a lot of explanations, and was it this and that, and did we have a cut down on this or what happened? But when you look into the Scandinavian, this is not random. This is not like something, "Oops, something just happened." This is non-random. This has something to do with whatever happened. And as I reckon, it's multi-factorial. It's not just one thing going on. And I'm quite sure, and we know that from studies already, that if you have a delayed treatment, if you have non-treatment like we saw with heart attack, you get a bigger damage or injury of the heart. And that, in the end, proceeds to heart failure and, in the end, early death. So, we have several good explanations also about the excess mortalities which you have in the UK. We may have that also. We just don't have the data yet publicly, which you have. And it shows that is the price of the lockdowns. That's for sure. When you lock down the health system, when you took away the ambulances, when people didn't go and have treatment for their heart attacks, they stayed at home and thought they were not allowed to come, or they were afraid of Corona, whatever it was.

And if they went, they were not allowed to have their relatives with them. And we know that relatives are quite important when you go through serious illness, someone to give you love, someone to take care of you, someone to comfort you, someone to make sure that you get your treatment and so on. And they were denied access. So, I think there are many reasons for that, and that's why I call it a human-made crisis, really, this excess mortality. And that's why I think it's so important to discuss and learn and hold on to it, of course, because that's the next problem. What on Earth can we do to stop that development? It seems like we have been stopping it now in Denmark, Norway and Finland, and you can see that from the graph as well. But then, what are we learning out of it? What happened? How can we make sure that it's not going to happen again? And so, I think I also think that some of it may be due to loneliness, social isolation, psychiatric diseases, suicide, and then in the end, we also have the discussion whether some of the excess mortality could be explained, and I'm not saying it is, but maybe could be explained by the vaccinations. We still don't know.

So, some of it, we know for sure, that it was the price of lockdowns and closing down the health system. And for the ones who may still be in doubt of that, I keep saying, "Well, if you think we don't need the health system as it works, you know when it works, why on Earth have the health system then?" You know, if you think that you could have the same results by locking down a health system, closing doors, only taking the acute patients, and so on, why on Earth build up a big health system? You know, it's bollocks really to say or pretend or don't think that it didn't matter. And I could see that the British Heart Association also had these explanations, so that's fine. But the thing about the vaccinations, that's still unclear. And it's a funny thing because if you go back to the graphs, John, you will actually see that we put in the line where the vaccination started. You see this line, and that's just to, it's, we have been doing that along the way when we made the graph during also the corona crisis. It's always, I wouldn't say fun, it's an unprobable, but it's always interesting to see when something happens, you know, when something changes, whatever it is. And that's why we have put that into the graph because someone will argue that the excess mortality also is associated with the vaccinations. I'm not saying it is because we don't have any data yet, at least we don't have in Denmark, that shows that it is or isn't. So, it's only speculative. But of course, that's also obvious to take into account, especially in view of our own study where we could see that some batches seem to give more reported side effects than other batches, which may prove that there could be a safety issue with some batches. And if there has been a safety issue, let's say you have some batches, as our study showed, which gave more reported side effects, well, of course, then you could expect that there could be a higher all-cause mortality, and that we're trying to look into. But I still think, and I'm getting back to that, but I still think it's interesting to see how close to that, where the vaccination started and continued. We have to remember that continued with one, two, third, one, one, second, and third vaccination. So, this excess mortality actually followed also the start of the vaccination and the continuing vaccination. And then again, I'm not saying, and that's very important for me to underline, that I'm not saying it caused the excess mortality. I'm just saying that it would be wrong not to have that take that into account also. And that's why I keep saying it's not just one explanation. It's just not one cause for the excess mortality. It's definitely many causes.

Yeah, do you think post-COVID sequelae could be part of the long-term mortality as well, actually damage done to the organs as a result of the COVID infection?

Well, everything is possible. But from what we know from the studies, and that's not more than, I mean, you have to remember we also have post-flu. People also have, like, a long, you know, long, now we have long COVID, but we also have long flu. People also get side effects from flu and, you know, get worse and worse. so I would still expect that it would be more or less the same patterns as when we had a flu season or a flu pandemic and so on. No, not really. But then again, all I'm saying is that it is multifactorial. But one thing is for sure, and we know that already from data on heart attacks, is that when we had the lockdowns and people who had heart attacks, the damage on the heart was at least 25% bigger than outside of the lockdowns. This confirms that you need treatment for heart attacks, and if you had such big damage on the heart, you will die sooner. So, it's like with cancer, the same story that people didn't get the treatment and the diagnosis. Of course, if you have a delayed diagnosis and delayed treatment, you'll die earlier. So, all I'm saying is that we have to look into this, but it has to be in a transparent way and an open-minded discussion.

And that's what's been lacking, really. Because when the numbers are so varying as they are, you can look at these numbers we just showed, John. They are official numbers. This is not numbers we have been doing this or that to. These are actually the official numbers. And when they are that obvious, of course, we need to have that discussion. We demand to have that discussion to save lives, to prevent it from continuing, and to do whatever we can to save people. Because as it is also now in the UK, people are dying, I would say, for no reason. But they shouldn't be because it's too many.

Following your excellent paper on the vaccine batches, do you plan to use a similar research methodology now to study the excess deaths?

Yes, and we already are going ahead with that. First of all, we're going ahead with having our data updated and see if there are new data we can put into and see if the pattern is still there. It seems to be three different ways of having side effects. Some batches tend to give small side effects, others less, and some none. So, we're looking into that. But also, we are trying to look into all-cause mortality to see if one would expect, I'm not saying so, but one would expect, especially now since there's been some time period, that people who had the blue batches, the batches which most reported side effects, would have higher mortality. So, we're trying to get that data. But I must admit that we are having a little harassment from the parties where we're having the data from. They're trying to withhold the data from us. But eventually, we will have the data because we have our rights to get those data. We are looking into it and very, very eager to get that so we can put it together and see whether we will find that pattern or not the pattern. And that's science in its essence. We need to have the data. We need to have the real numbers because otherwise, we will just stick to guessing. And now I'm guessing that there will be a pattern, but we need to have that documented or the other way around, showing that that's not the case.

You're not guessing, you're postulating a hypothesis. And I think it's important to mention that a hypothesis is a testable statement. Yes, it's testable for the hypothesis, and we can then go on and test this. Because one hypothesis would be that the people who had more adverse reactions from those batches that gave more adverse reactions, as we would expect if we follow those people up longitudinally, they would develop more sequelae as a result of, for example, tissue damage. But of course, that's a hypothesis. We have to test that based on the actual data. Yes, and it's a better and more proper way of explaining it. You're quite right. So, it is a hypothesis, whatever hypothesis.

I'm glad we're not doing this interview in Danish.

No, exactly. I appreciate it. It would be easier for me, at least. No, but you're right. That's the right way of putting it, and that's, of course, what we're doing, and that's, of course, our argument for doing it. And as you said yourself, one would expect that there would be, maybe not now, maybe within a year or two, but one would expect, or at least that's also the hypothesis, that there will be higher all-cause mortality in those who received the blue batches. But still, it would be wrong of me if I said that is the case because we still don't have that data. That's why we're trying to get hold of that data and will, in the end, test the hypothesis.

So, what we need to do is get the data to you, then you can test that hypothesis, and you could say, you know what, we were completely wrong. These people made a full recovery. Or you can say, look, this hypothesis is substantiated. These people are dying at a much faster rate and getting other sequelae at a much faster rate. Until we've got the data, we can't say. In fact, it's not a matter of being right or wrong. The data will either support or refute the hypothesis. There's no emotion here.

No, and I think we really have to do it. There's a demand, as I see it. We have this idea, we have this speculation about an obvious thing to speculate about. So, I think we are demanded to go, and I also think, in the end, this is something the authorities should look into. I think this was actually something, you know, I mean, we have been able to do it. We've done it already for the last three and a half years. We've been looking into this data, you know, in our spare time or for free. But literally, we have someone who gets a monthly pay to do this job. And I think it's quite devastating or it's quite sad or it's quite, you know, I don't know what's the right word, disappointing. That they're not doing it because, as I said before, this is actually costing lives. This could be your family, this could be the ones we love most in the world, this could be ourselves. I think it's such a big threat toward the population. And if you saw how much energy was spent, money was spent, you know, on this crazy Corona psychosis, on this, oh, you know, whatever it took, I think in Denmark, you know, billions were being used on all these matters, and you know, nothing really happened, at least not in Denmark, with the mortality. And here you have an opportunity, and here you have like an apparent, an obvious excess mortality, and no one seems to care. And that's just even more, we're living in a crazy world because people are dying, people are losing their loved ones, and no one seems to care. And that's really, really strange, and that's why I'm saying the authorities should literally, in the end, look into this. They have those data already, and that's what they're paid to do. Exactly, exactly. And that's what our tax money goes to, so we should actually expect them to do this. But we're very happy to do it and continue our work, but I still think that someone who should, as part of their job, has been doing it already.

And now I'm postulating a hypothesis that there will be a pattern, but we need to have that documented or the other way around, showing that that's not the case.

You're not guessing, you're postulating a hypothesis, and I think it's important to mention a hypothesis is a testable statement. Yes, it's testable for the hypothesis, and we can then go on and test this.

Exactly.

Because one hypothesis would be that the people who had more adverse reactions from those batches that gave more adverse reactions, as we would expect if we follow those people up longitudinally in a longitudinal study, they would develop more sequelae as a result of, for example, tissue damage. But of course, that's a hypothesis we have to test based on the actual data.

Yes, and it's a better and a more proper way of explaining it. You're quite right. So, it is a whatever hypothesis.

I'm glad we're not doing this interview in Danish.

No, exactly. I appreciate it. It would be easier for me, at least. But you're right. So, that's the right way of putting it, and that's, of course, what we're doing. And that's, of course, what our arguments for doing it are. And as you said yourself, one would expect that there would be, maybe not now, maybe within a year or two, but one would expect, or at least, that's also the very, that there will be a higher all-cause mortality enclosed to the blue batches. But still, it would be wrong of me if I said that is the case because we still don't have those data. And that's why we're trying to get hold of those data and will, in the end, of course.

So, what we need to do is get the data to you. Then, you can test that hypothesis, and you could say, 'You know what, we were completely wrong. These people made a full recovery.' Or you can say, 'Look, this hypothesis is substantiated. These people are dying at a much faster rate and getting other sequelae at a much faster rate.' Until we've got the data, we can't say that. In fact, it's not a matter of being right or wrong. The data will either support or refute the hypothesis. There's no emotion here, no.

And I think, you know, I think it's quite devastating or it's quite sad or it's quite, you know, I don't know what's the right word.

Disappointing.

Disappointing, exactly, that they're not doing it because, as I said before, this is actually costing lives. I mean, this could be your family. This could be the ones we love most in the world. This could be ourselves. I think it's such a big threat toward the population, and if you saw how much energy was spent, money was spent, you know, on this crazy, you know, Corona psychosis, on this, uh, oh, you know, whatever it took, I think in Denmark, you know, it's just billions were being used on all these matters, and you know, nothing really happened, at least not in Denmark with the mortality. And here, you have an opportunity, and here you have an obvious excess mortality, and no one seems to care. And that's just even more, we're living in a crazy world. Well, because it, people are dying, people are losing their, you know, loved ones, and no one seems to care. And that's really, really strange. And that's why I'm saying the authorities should literally, in the end, look into these data because they have those data already.

And that's what they're paid to do.

Exactly, exactly. And that's what, you know, our tax money goes to, so we should actually expect them to do this. But, but we're very happy to do it and continue our work. But I still think that there's someone who should, as part of their job, has been doing it already and keep doing it. But, but that's not the case.

And people who don't have to fight for the data, you have to fight for the data. Now, are you……

And I think that's where, yeah, I think that it's harassment. It's an harassment, you know, that's the way to put it. And we can see from how they have behaved, that's the Danish Institute. We can see how they have behaved, how they have, you know, tried and harassed our work. It's actually quite disgusting, really,  and it's like it's their own, uh, own data, no, it's public data. They are just taken care of and, uh, managing. So, I think, but then again, that's because our study actually did point out that someone who was, and still supposed to look after the safety issue and the safety sickness actually didn't do that work properly. And that seems to be the reason why they try and harass us. But in the end, of course, we, uh, are allowed to have those data. And we're just waiting to get those because we can quite easily start to make that a statistical analysis and then continue that and see if something will happen or if it's just as you said before, refute that combination or that connection. That would be fine also. That's literally science in a nutshell. That you say you have a hypothesis, you have an idea, you test that, and either it's right or it's wrong. And that's what, and that's why we all are so eager to get and, and dependent on also for the future public health.

Are you confident that in time, you can get the data of who was vaccinated, who wasn't, how many doses of vaccine people had, what adverse reactions there were, what long-term morbidity and mortality there was, and be able to correlate these two variables? I mean, in other words, are we going to know the answer to this question at some point in the future?

Oh, yes, I'm quite sure we will. I mean, it's just a matter of time because they can't keep the numbers away from us and the data. No, no, so they're not allowed to do that. So we will in the end, and also from the data we have already, we are now trying to look more into the qualitative, look more into which batches did we see adverse events, and which batches gave myocarditis, which batches were the ones giving more tinnitus, were there some batches giving more muscle aches, and, all these strokes, heart failure, whatever. So we have already a bunch of data which we could look more specifically into and see if we can see a pattern of symptoms and so on. So we still have a lot of data we can look into. We have a huge amount of data, but it's just that this all-cause mortality, especially now, where the excess mortality is so obvious, because for one month, May-June, and then you expect, "All right, July, maybe it will fall," but as we saw in the graphs, it just continues, now flattens, but still. So now it's so obvious that we need these data desperately, either to say that that is the case or the opposite, no, that's not the case. Both answers,  we are eager to have. So I'm quite sure in the end, we will get the data. But none of us likes to be harassed. We talked about that earlier. It's so frustrating, and it's so unfair, and it's so not scientific. I mean, as I explained earlier, usually you have a very polite tone within scientists, and that, and for some odd reason, just that one place and one professor at that Film Institute is so rude and not understandable how you can behave like that. But then again, you will see people now and then behaving improperly. But that shouldn't keep us away from getting the data. So we will get the data. That's for sure. But it's frustrating.

So over time, we'll be able to correlate doses and vaccine batches with diseases and morbidity, and we'll get a positive correlation, we'll get a negative correlation, we'll get no correlation. But sooner or later, we'll get that. And once that correlation is established, it will then be necessary for the people in laboratories to come up with pathological explanations for that, biology.

Yeah, exactly, and that's the next part. If that is the case that some of the excess mortality is also based on vaccinations, then of course, why are people dying? Is it due to cancer? Is it myocarditis? Is it heart failure? Is it heart problems of sorts? That is, of course, the next explanation. What's actually happening? Sudden death syndrome? What's happening when people die? Well, people have always been dying, certainly, but, will there be a pattern? Will it have something to do with Spike proteins? Would it have something to do, with a buildup of that in spatial organs? I mean, all that, then we can get that explanation. So I keep saying that it's all a bit of the apostle, so in the end, there will be a bigger picture. And I think also, if you look at the firms behind, like Pfizer, I think actually, they should be looking into these data. They have……

I suspect they are looking into the data feed, just they are probably not telling us.

No, no, they are probably, but they should. And we have a demand or desire, and both, to have those data. But nevertheless, we have the public data, and it would be quite, I wouldn't say easy,  but quite easily, we could start out and see if there was a connection, as I said before, with all-cause mortality. And other scientists could do the same. I mean, that's also a point that none said, that this was only up to us to continue. I mean, I would love if someone else had these studies and published that also because the more we get and the more data we get, you could see how much we learned from the data from Denmark, Finland, Norway. The more we compare countries in between, the more we see a pattern. Because if you and I just had one of the graphs today, let's say from Denmark, then someone could say, "Well, that's probably the Danes, they don't know how to live, so they died a whole bunch of them." You know.

So basically, obviously, the Danish lager causing that.

Exactly. There you go. They drink too much, and all that. But then when you see suddenly the different countries, and you see the pattern, suddenly you say, "Oh my God, something weird is going on here." So we learn a lot from Danish data, from UK data. I look very, I'm very happy with ONS because they publish much more than the Danish authorities do.

It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.

Yeah, it's much better than Danish data, which we can't get hold of more than two years ago, and there's such a delay on that. But nevertheless, we keep learning from all these data and, in the end, put together a picture. And that's what it's all about, really.

Well, thank you so much for your work, Vibeke. I know it's self-sacrificial work, and I'm remarkably reassured to learn that eventually, we are going to get answers to these questions due to your tenacity, people like yourself working through the opposition.

Exactly.

Working through a good scientific process, using valid, well-established scientific techniques. It has to be. Exactly, these are there.Um, it's just a pity that people aren't being more facilitative, saying, "Look, here's your data." You know, they should be coming around, knocking on your door, giving you the data.

Exactly, they should be standing there eager to give us the data and begging us to look at the data as soon as possible. Also, the politicians, because I think that's also interesting that they are silent. You know, if I was a politician going into politics to save the world, to save humans, you know, all this and that, I would also be knocking on the door and saying, "Oh, give them those data ASAP. Let's have the answer tomorrow or even better, you know, yesterday. Let's do something." But they are also silent, which astonishes me, and it's just crazy. And I can't really understand it because I think a lot of people have the same drive as you and I have and went into politics or became a doctor for the same reasons. And I simply can't understand, exactly as you said, why they're not hammering on the door and saying, "Oh, please, here's the data. Look into it. Let's see what's the answer." But instead, they lock the door, try to silence you, try to harass you, defame you, all that. It's, I, you know, I simply can't understand it.

Well, I think you were being very generous there, but I'll duplicate the motivation of politicians. But we do believe that some people genuinely want to be public servants, so let's hope those people step forward and are able to take charge of the...

Maybe some forget, maybe some forget along the way what's got them going in the start. But I still believe that, the best in my human fellows, that most of them have a good drive and, a good, just the people. So, I think, but, but then again, I can't imagine that people go to work every day just to hurt others. You know, I simply can't imagine. I mean, there may be a few, but most people will try to make the world a better place to be. And I still think that lots of people think that's what they're doing. That's their drive, or at least, I hope that's what they're doing. And it seems like someone forgot that along the way. As it is for now.

We need to get back to the idealism of our youth, don't we? When we really wanted to make the world a better place. You do get life's experiences that tend to knock it out of you, but we need to go back to that and renew our efforts, genuinely working for the benefit of all human beings. And you are. It's an important thing.

And also, I think I've been doing that along the way as a doctor, and I'm quite sure you'll be doing the same. I think it's very important now and then to remind yourself, why did I go into this field? What was my drive? What did I try to achieve? What did I try to make a difference in? And I know for sure what my drive is. That is exactly to get more people to have a happy life, children to have a happy life, a longer, happy, and healthy life, you know, and with their loved ones. So, but you're right, sometimes we tend to forget the drive of the youth if we don't keep reminding ourselves. Yes, and that's what, at least, I'm trying to do along the way.

Absolutely, yeah. I have one last question for you Vibeke, will you come back and give us the data when you've got it?

Oh, yes, that's for sure. I love being on your show, John. I think it's so funny. So, I'm very happy, you know. No, I must say that you're doing tremendous work. I know that a lot of people are watching your videos, and you're making a big difference. So, you know, I'm so happy to be on your show, and I will definitely come back whenever I have something we could share with your public. So, we'll definitely hear from me again.

Thank you very much. And, of course, as well as helping people, this form of work, this form of analysis has a benefit, which is only a benefit. It's not really why we do it, but it is also absolutely fascinating. So, it does make it easier to do. Vibeke, as always, a total pleasure. Thank you for everything you're doing, and we're really looking forward to some firm data as soon as you've got it. And we'll look forward to that. Thank you.

Thank you. And thank you for having me.
