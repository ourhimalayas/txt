Instead of watching the Oscars, watch my latest video: Have you been LIED TO about what your BLOOD PRESSURE should be? I believe the guidance is wrong, and this affects millions of people

【不要看奥斯卡，看我的最新视频：有关你的血压应该是多少，你被欺骗了吗？我认为指导是错误的，而且这影响了数百万人。】

以下本段视频的全英文纪要：

**Dr. Suneel Dhand:** Hi everyone, I'm Dr. Suneel Dhand, an internal medicine physician. Welcome to another video. What is an ideal blood pressure? It's an important question, isn't it? We've all heard of blood pressure before, and the most commonly cited ideal number is 120 over 80. The top number is the systolic number, that's the 120, and that represents the maximum pressure as the heart contracts and blood surges into the great vessels surrounding the heart. That's the systolic blood pressure. The bottom number is the diastolic blood pressure, and that represents the minimum pressure as the heart relaxes and immediately before it starts contracting again, that part of the cardiac cycle that is the diastolic number. And that's where we come up with the something over something, the systolic over diastolic blood pressure.

And the more I think about this, the more I believe it's absolutely ludicrous that we would have this one-size-fits-all approach, ideal blood pressure 120 over 80. How can you have an ideal blood pressure for everybody? People come in different shapes and sizes, people at different ages, everybody probably has their own ideal blood pressure. So it's ridiculous that we would push, push, push this notion of an ideal blood pressure. I do not believe it has been truly thought through, and it seems like every passing year the guidance from the medical establishment gets more and more aggressive. And I also believe on many levels this is a complete money grab, especially by the US medical establishment that is absolutely fixated on pushing more and more pharmacological products to help out their big pharma sponsors. This is likely causing harm.

I really believe especially in an older population, this push for strict blood pressure control is really not helping a lot of people as they get older. And I talked about this in a recent video in terms of blood pressure management in the hospital. But I also believe it applies as an outpatient when people are outside at home. Many people only get blood pressure measured in a doctor's office, which is a bad idea because that's not always representative of what a true blood pressure is.

Now I'm not suggesting that you allow the blood pressure to drift up to exceedingly high levels. I think if the top number, the systolic, is above 170, 180, and the bottom number, the diastolic, is above 100, yes, you are then in a territory where for most people it should be brought down with medication. However, it's that gray area where the systolic number, the top number, is between 120 to 140, 150, and the bottom number is between 80 and 100. I believe there's a lot of gray there, particularly when people are only getting their blood pressure measured in a doctor's office or a clinic.

What you have to remember from a scientific standpoint is that it is natural for blood pressure to increase with age, especially over the age of 65. This happens for many scientific reasons, changes that happen to the body including loss of elasticity of the blood vessels. Blood vessels tend to stiffen, there are hormonal changes, there are changes in kidney function, and a lot of this is a natural adaptation to the process of aging. And again, I'm not suggesting that you allow the blood pressure to drift up to dangerously high levels, but the question is, should we be overly aggressive in lowering the blood pressure?

I know that there are a lot of people out there, especially in an older age group, who now are running at blood pressure systolic between 100 and 120, and I believe that we're being way too aggressive in bringing the blood pressure down with one, two, three, sometimes three or more medications. And as for younger people under the age of 50, let's say, there is a school of thought which I actually subscribe to that nearly all cases of high blood pressure are due to insulin resistance. Not 100% of cases, but nearly all cases are due to insulin resistance, and I've made videos about insulin resistance previously including how you test for it, blood tests like blood glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR.

I put links to those videos down below, but we have a pandemic of insulin resistance, it's exploding across Western countries, primarily due to a poor lifestyle and a terrible diet high in ultra-processed foods, refined carbohydrates, and sugars. And insulin resistance leads to high blood pressure through a number of mechanisms, including impaired vasodilation, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, renal sodium retention, endothelial dysfunction, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. But those are all very technical terms which we can certainly save for another video.

So what would be my advice then if you are diagnosed with high blood pressure and you're on medications or your doctor is thinking of putting you on medications? Well, first and foremost, as I just said, because so many cases are caused by insulin resistance, I would advise you to aggressively work on insulin resistance management, whatever lifestyle factors you can, because most people out there, when they work on this and succeed, their need for blood pressure medications is greatly reduced. I've seen many people completely come off their blood pressure pills once they have successfully fixed their insulin resistance.

So, aside from that, and again, I'm not suggesting that you stop your pills or you do this without medical supervision because many people, their blood pressures are very high and they are on blood pressure pills for a reason, but I would suggest that you get a home blood pressure machine if you haven't purchased one already. They are very useful. And what I'd advise is that you measure your blood pressure for a couple of weeks, at least three times a day, in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

You keep a record of your blood pressures, and then when you next go back to your doctor's office, make sure that when they measure your blood pressure in the clinic, also have your home machine with you to make sure that the two correlate, that your home blood pressure machine is actually showing the same reading that the blood pressure machine in the clinic is showing because some of these home blood pressure machines are not even accurate. So you want to do that, and then once you have recordings of your blood pressure at home, you can go through them with your doctor, hopefully a trusted doctor, to see if any changes need to be made.

And what I find is that there are a lot of people who will find that they are on blood pressure pills, 1, 2, 3, however many blood pressure pills, and they're regularly checking their blood pressure at home, and they're frequently getting systolic readings, that's the top number, between 100 to 120, which I believe is on the lower side. And particularly as one ages, this starts to cause a problem. Many people can start to feel weak, they can start to feel dizzy, many people can have fainting episodes, elderly people can fall, and many times it's because their blood pressure has dropped. So what I would encourage you to do if you find that your blood pressure pills and your blood pressure readings at home are on the lower side, then go through this with your doctor and see if you can successfully wean yourself down from any of those medications. That would be my advice.

But first and foremost, for most people out there, work on that insulin resistance. If you do that successfully, many people out there can come off their blood pressure pills completely, which is a real win. Why do you want to be on blood pressure pills or any medication if you don't need to? Thanks, everyone, for watching. Feel free to comment down below, let me know your thoughts on blood pressure control. Remember, unfortunately, huge segments of the medical establishment are completely and utterly corrupted, and one of the best things you can do for your health and well-being is take your health into your own hands for yourself and your family. Make those right decisions every day so you have the least possible chance of ever needing doctors, hospitals, or any healthcare interactions.

I'm a doctor myself, that's my own personal goal. I have no desire to go anywhere near any healthcare facility, aside from working there, obviously, but as a patient, I will do everything possible to avoid that, and I encourage you to as well.

以下为本段视频的中文大意：

**Dr. Suneel Dhand:** 大家好，我是内科医生Suneel Dhand医生，欢迎来到另一个视频。什么是理想的血压？这是一个重要的问题，不是吗？我们都听说过血压，最常被提及的理想数字是120/80。顶部数字是收缩压，即120，表示[[zh:心脏]]收缩时血液涌入[[zh:心脏]]周围的大血管时的最大压力。这就是收缩压。底部数字是舒张压，表示[[zh:心脏]]在放松之际和再次收缩之前的最小压力，这是[[zh:心脏]]周期的一部分，即舒张压。这就是我们得出收缩压与舒张压的比例的地方。

我越想越觉得，这个一刀切的方法非常荒谬，理想的血压是120/80。你怎么可能为每个人都制定一个理想的血压呢？人们的体形和大小各不相同，不同年龄的人，每个人可能都有自己的理想血压。所以，我们不厌其烦地推崇这种理想血压的概念是荒谬的。我不相信它真的经过深思熟虑，似乎每年医学界的指导都变得越来越咄咄逼人。我也相信在许多层面上，这完全是抢钱，尤其是[[zh:美国]]的医学界，他们完全专注于推动更多的药物产品来帮助他们的大型[[zh:制药]]赞助商。这可能会造成伤害。

我真的相信，特别是在[[zh:老年]]人群中，对严格控制血压的推动实际上并没有在[[zh:老年]]人变老时帮助很多人。我在最近的一个视频中讨论了这个问题，就是[[zh:关于]]医院内的血压管理。但我也相信，这也适用于人们在家外面时的门诊。许多人只在医生办公室测量血压，这是一个不好的主意，因为那不总是代表真实的血压。

现在我并不是在建议你让血压上升到非常高的水平。我认为，如果顶部数字，即收缩压，超过170、180，底部数字，即舒张压，超过100，那么，对于大多数人来说，应该通过药物将其降低。然而，当收缩压数字在120到140、150之间，底部数字在80到100之间的灰色地带时，我认为存在很多灰色地带，特别是当人们只在医生办公室或诊所测量血压时。

从[[zh:科学]]的角度来看，你必须记住，随着年龄增长，血压增加是自然的，尤其是在65岁以上。这是由于许多[[zh:科学]]原因造成的，包括身体的变化，包括血管弹性的丧失。血管倾向于变硬，[[zh:激素]]水平发生变化，肾功能发生变化，很多都是对衰老过程的自然适应。再次强调，我并不建议你让血压升高到危险的高水平，但问题是，我们是否应该过于激进地降低血压？

我知道，在那里有很多人，特别是年龄较大的人群，他们的收缩压现在在100到120之间，我相信我们在通过一两三甚至三种以上的药物降低血压时过于激进。至于年龄在50岁以下的年轻人，假设有一种观点，实际上我是赞同的，即几乎所有高血压病例都是由[[zh:胰岛素]]抵抗引起的。并非所有病例都是，但几乎所有病例都是由于[[zh:胰岛素]]抵抗引起的，我之前已经制作过[[zh:关于]][[zh:胰岛素]]抵抗的视频，包括如何进行检测，例如血糖、糖化[[zh:血红蛋白]]、HOMA-IR等血液检测。

我在下面放了链接，但我们面临着[[zh:胰岛素]]抵抗的大流行，它正在[[zh:西方国家]]迅速蔓延，主要是由于不良的生活方式和可怕的饮食，其中包括高度加工食品、精制碳水化合物和糖类。[[zh:胰岛素]]抵抗通过一系列机制导致高血压，包括血管舒张功能受损、交感神经系统活性增加、[[zh:肾脏]]钠潴留、内皮功能障碍以及肾素\-血管紧张素\-醛固酮系统的激活。但这些都是非常技术性的术语，我们可以在另一个视频中详细解释。

那么，如果你被诊断患有高血压，并且正在服用药物，或者你的医生正在考虑给你开药，我的建议是什么呢？首先，也是最重要的，正如我刚刚所说，因为有很多病例是由于[[zh:胰岛素]]抵抗引起的，我建议你积极地努力控制[[zh:胰岛素]]抵抗，无论你能做出什么样的生活方式改变，因为大多数人，当他们努力解决这个问题并成功时，他们对降压药物的需求会大大减少。我见过许多人一旦成功地解决了他们的[[zh:胰岛素]]抵抗问题，就完全停止了服用降压药物。

因此，除此之外，我再次强调，我并不建议你停止服药，或者在没有医疗监督的情况下这样做，因为很多人的血压非常高，他们需要服用降压药物，但我建议你如果还没有购买的话，可以购买一台家用血压计。它们非常有用。我建议你连续几周每天至少三次，早上、下午和晚上测量你的血压。

你记录下你的血压情况，然后当你下次回到医生办公室时，确保在他们测量你的血压时，也带着你的家用血压计，以确保两者一致，即你的家用血压计显示的读数与诊所内的血压计显示的读数相同，因为有些家用血压计不那么准确。所以你需要做的就是这样，然后一旦你在家里记录了你的血压，你可以和你的医生一起仔细研究，希望是一位值得信赖的医生，看看是否需要做任何改变。

我发现有很多人发现他们正在服用降压药物，一种、两种、三种，甚至更多种降压药物，并且他们经常在家里检查他们的血压，他们的收缩压读数经常在100到120之间，我认为这是在较低的一侧。特别是随着年龄的增长，这开始成为一个问题。许多人可能会感到虚弱，他们可能会感到头晕，许多人可能会出现晕厥，[[zh:老年]]人可能会摔倒，而这往往是因为他们的血压下降了。所以如果你发现你的血压药物和家庭血压读数偏低，我鼓励你与你的医生一起讨论，看看是否可以成功地减少服用任何一种药物。那就是我的建议。

但首先，对于大多数人来说，首要的是，解决[[zh:胰岛素]]抵抗问题。如果你成功地做到了这一点，那么很多人可以完全停止服用降压药物，这是一个真正的胜利。如果不需要的话，你为什么要服用降压药物或任何药物呢？感谢大家观看。请随时在下方评论，让我知道你对血压控制的想法。请记住，不幸的是，医疗界的很大一部分已经完全堕落，你为了自己和家人的健康和幸福，最好的做法之一是将健康掌握在自己手中，每天都做出正确的决定，这样你就能尽可能地减少需要医生、医院或任何医疗互动的可能性。

我自己也是一名医生，这是我的个人目标。我不希望接近任何医疗机构，当然除非是工作，但作为一个患者，我会尽一切可能避免那种情况，我也鼓励你这样做。再次感谢大家，请查看我的健康学院和在线课程，链接都在下面，还有我的免费通讯链接。如果你还没有注册，请注册。如果你喜欢这个视频，请点赞，如果你希望未来有更多类似的视频，请点击铃铛按钮。这确实有助于算法，让这些视频尽可能广泛地分享。大家保重，我们下一个视频再见。
