And I will tell you something else. There’s another reason for the boosters. I have said this nonstop People ask me all the time about this shedding question, do the vaccinated shed on the unvaccinated? Yes, they do. These shots are designed to do that.

我还要告诉你一件事。还有一个原因为什么要打加强针。我没日没夜在说这个问题，人们一直在问我这个（刺突蛋白）脱落的问题，接种疫苗的人会不会把刺突蛋白脱落到未接种疫苗的人身上？是的，他们会。这些疫苗就是用来做这个的。

The Pfizer documents, the Pfizer documents for their own trial, they did not allow any female to get a shot of the two. They had to be pregnancy tested before they got each shot. And if they were pregnant,  they were not allowed to get the shots.

辉瑞公司的文件，辉瑞公司自己的试验文件，他们不允许任何怀孕女性注射这种药物。她们在接种每一针之前都必须验孕。如果她们怀孕了，就不允许她们接种。

So just so you know, they’re pushing a shot on pregnant women that they’ve never actually tested on a pregnant woman because they were excluded from the trial. The reason why I bring up the pregnant woman is because on page 67 of their 146 Page Pfizer trial document

所以你要知道，他们正在向孕妇推广一种他们从未在孕妇身上实际测试过的针剂，因为她们被排除在试验之外。我之所以提出孕妇，是因为在长达146页的辉瑞试验文件的第67页上

on page 67, it actually states that if a pregnant woman is inside the room with a vaccinated trial participant that actually states that if the vaccinated person is aware that there’s a pregnant woman in the same room as him, who breathe the same air or touches the skin of the vaccinated that the vaccine trial participant has to report that back to Pfizer as a serious adverse event to the pregnant woman and her baby.

实际上指出，如果孕妇与接种疫苗的试验参与者同处一室…实际上它指出，如果接种疫苗的人知道有一个孕妇与他同处一室，呼吸同样的空气或接触接种疫苗者的皮肤，疫苗试验参与者必须向辉瑞公司报告，按照对孕妇及其婴儿的严重不良事件来报告。

And then the Pfizer trial sponsor who’s giving the shots to the guy or girl has to follow the pregnant woman’s pregnancy for the next six months to see this you lose the baby, does she miscarried the baby or does the baby die?

然后给那个男人或女人打针的辉瑞公司试验赞助商必须在接下来的六个月里跟踪该孕妇的怀孕情况，看看她是否失去了孩子，她是否流产了，或者孩子是否死亡？

That’s considered a serious adverse event. Now, by definition, I know you guys don’t know this. There are two definitions in every trial. They have listed what are called adverse events. For example, you got the shot and it was sore that turned red. That’s a adverse event.

这被认为是一个严重的不良事件。根据定义，我知道你们不知道这个。每个试验中都有两个定义。他们已经列出了所谓的不良事件。例如，你打了一针，打针的地方痛并变红了。这就是一个不良事件。

If I give you the shot, and your heart stops, and you have to be brought back to life with a defibrillator. That’s called a serious adverse event. Something that is life threatening is called serious adverse event.

如果我给你打针，而你的心脏停止了，必须用除颤器把你救活。这就叫严重不良事件。威胁到生命的事情被称为严重不良事件。

They said that if a pregnant woman is breathing the same air as a vaccinated person, that is considered a serious adverse event to the pregnant woman and her baby.

他们说，如果一个孕妇和一个接种疫苗的人呼吸着同样的空气，那们对孕妇和她的孩子来说就被认为属于严重的不良事件

Why did they know that would be dangerous, because through the air exchange of the vaccinated person as he breathes or coughs or sneezes, he will actually cough out and sneeze or breathe, exhale, the spike proteins inside the shots that person got.

为什么他们知道这会是危险的，因为通过空气交换，接种疫苗的人在呼吸或咳嗽或打喷嚏时 实际上会播散来自疫苗的刺突蛋白。

And they are shedding that on people around them. These shots are designed to shed from you to other people, they have already successfully demonstrated this with mRNA vaccines in animals, they can vaccinate a few animals, and then release them in the wild to go vaccinate the rest of the animals through shedding.

他们正在把刺突蛋白播散给周围的人。这些被设计的疫苗（会让刺突蛋白）从你身上脱落到其他人身上，他们已经成功地用mRNA疫苗和动物证明了这一点，他们可以为一些动物接种疫苗，然后将它们释放到野外，通过刺突蛋白脱落去为其他动物接种疫苗。

They’ve already done that. They’re now doing it with you. I actually said people asked me for this hole last year. How long do people shed for? Well, this is what we know. This is what I told them

他们已经这样做了。他们现在把它用在你们身上了。实际上我说过，去年人们问我，人们会脱落多长时间？嗯，这是我们所知道的。这也是我告诉他们的

only people that know how long these vaccines shed for is the drug companies. They’re the only ones that know. And when they talk in the media, they’re going to tell you so pay attention to what they say. These shots were designed to vaccinate a certain part of the population, knowing a lot of the population would resist.

只有制药公司知道这些疫苗的刺突蛋白脱落会维持多久。他们是唯一知道的人。而当他们在媒体上谈话时，他们会告诉你的，所以要注意他们所说的。这些疫苗的设计是为了给某一部分人注射疫苗，因为他们知道很多人都会抵制。

So in order to mass vaccinate the entire world with their agenda, they have to continue to pump booster shots into the vaccinated to maximally shed on all the other people. And I said just watch from the beginning. I said just watch.

因此，为了按照他们的计划对整个世界进行大规模的疫苗接种，他们必须继续给已接种疫苗的人打加强针，以最大限度地让所有其他人（间接）接种。我从一开始就说过，看着吧。我说了就看吧。

Listen to what Pfizer Maderna Johnson Johnson say they will come out in the media and say that they are now seeing that their immunity is waning for X amount of time, and you need to get a booster shot.

听听辉瑞，莫德纳和强生公司的说法，他们会在媒体上说，现在看到他们的免疫力在某段时间内减弱了，你需要打加强针。

What they’re actually saying is our shots we now know are maximally shedding for this period and we have to give our boosters now.

他们实际上的意思是，我们现在知道我们的针剂只能在这段时间内才会最大限度的脱落刺突蛋白，所以我们现在必须推出我们的加强针了。

So when you hear Pfizer Maderna say our immunity is waning over a six month period. No it’s not. Their shedding is waning. And what what’s happening is they have to reboot them

因此，当你听到辉瑞和摩德纳公司说我们的免疫力在六个月内减弱时。不，不是的。而是他们的刺突蛋白脱落正在减弱。而他们要做的就是必须打加强针。
