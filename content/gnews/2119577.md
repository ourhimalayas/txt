本文视频引用来源：[Mike Vogiatzakis – Apr 13, 2023 – Winnipeg, Manitoba](https://nationalcitizensinquiry.ca/witness/mike-vogiatzakis/#1689907599657-fefa385c-a7e7b958-5585)（迈克·沃加亚扎基斯 - 2023年[[zh:4月13日]] - 曼尼托巴省温尼伯），对于这位出席的证人，视频下边的介绍如下：

【Mr. Vogiatzakis is the general manager of Voyage funeral home. He recalls the real fear of COVID and how he was initially worried about the effects of the virus and even being close to his own family members. Mr. Vogiatzakis was a witness to people being left to die alone. Older people were confused why their kids did not come to see them. Elders locked in their rooms as homemade prisons. A lady was escorted away by hospital security as she could hear her mother calling her clearly. Her mother died as she was being escorted out.】

中文大意：【沃加亚扎基斯先生是航行[[zh:殡仪]]馆的总经理。他回忆起 COVID 带来的真实恐惧，最初担心[[zh:病毒]]的影响，甚至不敢靠近自己的家人。沃加亚扎基斯先生亲眼目睹了人们被留下独自死去的情况。年长者感到困惑，不明白为何子女不来看他们。老人们像是被自家囚禁一样被锁在房间里。一位女士被医院保安护送离开，因为她能清晰听到母亲在呼唤她。她的母亲在她被护送出去的时候去世了。】

以下为节选视频第一部分，在这一部分视频里，Vogiatzakis先生以亲身经历揭露[[zh:加拿大政府]]在[[zh:新冠病毒]]期间刻意以[[zh:病毒]]制造恐惧，并以[[zh:政府]]所推行的种种政策伤害了很多家庭，伤害了很多人，并杀死了很多人，并且剥夺了亲人们进入医院与家人告别的权利。

视频对应英文原文如下：

**Wayne Lenhardt****：**Pick your own starting date, Mike, and tell us what you noticed that was different during the COVID epidemic relating to what you were seeing at your funeral home.

**Michael Vogiatzakis****：**I think it all starts when COVID started and the government put so much fear into us that even myself was afraid and thought I’d never see my family again because I thought I was going to die. I thought, geez, we’re the guys who are going to be touching these bodies that are dangerous and that have COVID and the blood is infected. Am I going to see my family again? Every time we went to a care home, we were frightened. We had staff meetings talking about this and offering staff to maybe not come to work if they didn’t want because of what we were going to be facing. The fear was so real that it scared us.

I remember my mom— When they said you couldn’t go see your parents and you couldn’t be with family. My dad had passed away a few years earlier. When I went to my mom’s house, I sat across the table from her, and I said, “Mom, don’t come near me. I don’t want to get you sick. Please, mom, stay on that side of the table.” And she goes, “Oh, don’t be silly. Give me a hug.” I go, “Mom, I can’t hug you, stay on that side of the table!”

And then reality kicked in one day when I went into a care home. A friend that I grew up with since I was a little boy, his dad came to the funeral home and said, “Mike, I have stage 4 cancer. I’m going to die. My last wish is for you to come to this care home and take me into your care once I die.” He goes, “You promise me you’ll do that.” I said, “Yes, sir.” It was three months into COVID, and I got a call from the care home, and this gentleman passed away. So I made my way up to the care home.

As I was proceeding to take him off the hospital bed, it was just me and a nurse alone in a room. I looked at this nurse, and I said, “Do you mind me asking how this person died? I’m just curious.” And she said, “Oh, he died of COVID.” I said, “Yeah, but this is a palliative care ward. This is comfort care. Aren’t people here just for comfort care? Aren’t the people in here, everyone on this floor, don’t they have cancer?” And she said, “Yes.” And I said, “Can I ask you a question?” I said, “What does the death certificate say?” She says, “It says COVID.” And I banged my hand on the table and I said to her, “Listen, I want the truth. This is my friend’s dad, and I want to know how he died.” She said, “I don’t want to lose my job. I don’t want to lose my job. He died of cancer.” Of course, he died of cancer. And I said to her, “You have five minutes to change this death certificate to the proper cause of death, otherwise, I’m going to turn on my phone. I’m going to go on Facebook live, and I’m going to make a mess out of this.” Five minutes later, this nurse came back with a new death certificate that said that this gentleman died of cancer.

My fear of getting sick and dying, instantly, went away. I knew there was something wrong and I knew that I was not in danger. And I was in every COVID room that you could imagine. Double COVID, double mask. You can’t do this. You can’t do that. That puts a lot of fear into a person. From that day on, I walked into care homes with confidence. At times, I didn’t wear a mask because when you’re removing somebody from a bed, you don’t want things poking in your eyes. You want to be able to see what you’re doing. You want to be comfortable with what you’re doing. So that day changed my life as a funeral director, and it changed the staff’s perspective on things.

During these two years of COVID, I want to go behind closed doors: behind closed doors where families weren’t allowed, where I was able to look at your families in the eyes and see the fear that they were going through, the confusion. A lot of these families were lost and they were scared. It puts tears in my eyes when I talk about this because it is real. What the government did is real, and it hurt a lot of families, and it hurt a lot of people. And it killed a lot of people. People died alone, and nobody should ever die alone. Nobody should ever be alone at the end of life. To hold your dad’s hand or to say, “I love you” or just for your loved ones to know that you’re at the corner of that bed means everything in the world. But no, they took our rights away as human beings to say goodbye. They took our rights away as parents to be there for our children. They took our right away to go into a hospital and say goodbye.

It reminds me of a story of a lady that was in the hospital, and she could hear her mom calling her clearly. And as her mom was calling her, the hospital called security and escorted this lady out of the hospital. On the two-way radio, she heard that somebody had passed away, and she looked at the security, and said, “Was that my mom’s room?” It was her mom’s room. They took her right away to say goodbye to her mom on her death bed. And how’s that right? How’s that right for us as human beings to put up with that? How’s that right for a government that we voted in to do this to their people, to straight out lie to us?

I want to just take you behind the scenes. I want to share some stories with you: stories that are going to touch your heart; stories that caused division and hate and anger and split a world in two, instantly, just like that. It breaks your heart to be able to go into these rooms and to see the hurt in people’s eyes, to see the fear in their eyes, to know that they’re going to die alone.

本文引用视频对应的中文大意如下：

**Wayne Lenhardt****：**[[zh:迈克]]，你自己选择一个起始日期，并告诉我们，在 COVID 流行期间，你在[[zh:殡仪]]馆所看到的有什么不同之处。

**Michael Vogiatzakis****：**我觉得一切都是在 COVID 开始时开始的，[[zh:政府]]让我们如此恐惧，甚至我自己也感到害怕，以至于觉得自己再也见不到家人了，因为我以为我会死。我觉得，天哪，我们是那些将要接触到危险并带有 COVID 和感染血液的尸体的人。我还能见到我的家人吗？每次我们去照料院，我们都感到害怕。我们开了员工会议谈论这个问题，并告诉员工，如果他们不愿意面对即将面临的问题，或许可以选择不来工作。恐惧是如此真实，它让我们感到恐慌。

我记得我妈妈——当他们说你不能去看望你的父母，不能与家人在一起时。我父亲几年前去世了。当我去我妈妈家时，我坐在她对面的桌子旁，我对她说：“妈妈，别靠近我。我不想让你感染[[zh:病毒]]。拜托了，妈妈，待在桌子的那边。” 她说：“哦，别傻了。给我一个拥抱。” 我说：“妈妈，我不能拥抱你，待在那边的桌子上！”

然后有一天现实打击了我，当我去了一家照料院。我从小就和他一起长大的朋友的父亲来到了临终室，他说：“[[zh:迈克]]，我得了第四期[[zh:癌症]]。我就要死了。我最后的愿望是你在我死后来到这个照料院，接管我的遗体。” 他说：“你答应我。” 我说：“是的，先生。” 当时 COVID 已经进行了三个月了，然后我接到了来自照料院的电话，这位绅士去世了。于是我去了照料院。

当我准备把他从医院床上移开时，只有我和一个护士独自在一个房间里。我看着这个护士，我说：“你介意我问一下这个人是怎么去世的吗？我只是好奇。” 她说：“哦，他死于 COVID。” 我说：“是的，但这是一个姑息疗法的病房。这是舒适护理。这里的人不都是来这里得到舒适护理的吗？这里的每个人，楼上的每个人，他们不都是得[[zh:癌症]]的吗？” 她说：“是的。” 我说：“我可以问你一个问题吗？” 我说：“死亡证明上写着什么？” 她说：“写着 COVID。” 我拍了一下桌子，对她说：“听着，我想要真相。这是我朋友的父亲，我想知道他是怎么去世的。” 她说：“我不想失去工作。我不想失去工作。他是死于[[zh:癌症]]的。” 当然，他是死于[[zh:癌症]]。我对她说：“你有五分钟时间来更改这个死亡证明的真实死因，否则我会打开我的手机。我会在 Facebook 上直播，我会弄得一团糟。” 五分钟后，这位护士拿着一份新的死亡证明回来，上面写着这位绅士死于[[zh:癌症]]。

我害怕生病和死亡的恐惧立即消失了。我知道有些事情不对劲，我知道我并不处于危险之中。我进入了所有你能想象到的 COVID 病房。双层 COVID，双层口罩。你不能做这个，你不能做那个。这让一个人感到很害怕。从那天起，我自信满满地走进照料院。有时候，我甚至不戴口罩，因为当你把某人从床上移开时，你不想让东西戳到你的眼睛。你想要看清楚你在做什么。你希望对你所做的事情感到自在。所以，那一天改变了我作为[[zh:殡仪]]馆馆长的生活，也改变了员工对事物的看法。

在这两年的 COVID 期间，我想进入幕后：那些不允许家人进入的地方，我能够面对你们家人，看着他们的眼睛，看到他们正在经历的恐惧、困惑。许多这样的家庭很迷茫，他们很害怕。每当我谈到这些事情时，我的眼泪就流下来，因为这是真实的。[[zh:政府]]所做的事情是真实的，它伤害了很多家庭，伤害了很多人，它杀死了很多人。很多人独自死去了，没有人应该[[zh:孤独]]地死去。没有人应该在生命的最后时刻独自一人。握着你父亲的手，说“我爱你”，或者只是让你的亲人知道你在那张床的角落意味着世界上的一切。但不，他们剥夺了我们作为人类的权利去告别。他们剥夺了我们作为父母的权利在我们的孩子身边。他们剥夺了我们进入医院与家人告别的权利。

这让我想起了一个故事，一个女士在医院里，她可以清楚地听到她的妈妈在叫她。当她的妈妈在叫她时，医院打电话叫来了保安，把这位女士赶出了医院。她听到了双频对讲机上有人去世的消息，她看着保安，说：“是我妈妈的房间吗？” 那确实是她妈妈的房间。他们剥夺了她去对她妈妈的临终照顾说再见的权利。这怎么公平？这怎么对得起我们作为人类去忍受？这对于我们选出来的[[zh:政府]]来说怎么是对的呢？他们对自己的人民这样做，直截了当地对我们撒谎？我只是想带你们走进幕后。我想和你们分享一些故事：一些会触动你心灵的故事；一些造成分裂、仇恨和愤怒的故事，并瞬间把世界一分为二。走进这些房间让人心碎，看到人们眼中的痛苦，看到他们眼中的恐惧，知道他们将要[[zh:孤独]]地死去。
