以下为本文引用视频的全英文纪要：

**Steve Kirsch:** So, you mentioned sudden deaths earlier. What do you think that, you know, most people are really bad at tracking this stuff, you know, and they're gaslit into thinking like people will go on to X and they'll post something like, "Well, sudden deaths have always happened, and you're just noticing it now because it's kind of a thing, but it's always been happening and it's been happening at the same rate, and all those athlete deaths that died suddenly, those have happened before, you just kind of never realized it because now you're just more aware. What do you think the number of sudden deaths is after the shots versus before the shots rolled out? What do you think the increase has been?

**Dr. Ryan Cole:** It depends on the nation and the age groups, but the actual aerial data doesn't lie, and I think that's where delving into some of the insurance company data has been important. Certain nations are running 6, 8, 10% above average in terms of expected deaths in the younger age cohorts, and it's still persisting. That's what's concerning to me. You may have better data than I do at the moment, but in certain age cohorts, the excess deaths are well above average, and the sudden deaths, yeah, we're noticing it more, and you look at Sargent Pfizer's lonely heart clot band and the number of famous media people that have suddenly passed, and people are like, "Well, it was anything but the vaccine," but now that we know how long that spike protein from the vaccine can persist in the body from Dr. Brogueness' study and so many other factors in terms of, is it contaminated DNA, is it within the shots causing other metabolic problems, there's continuing to be excess death above average and sudden death above expected average, plain and simple.

**Steve Kirsch:** And only started happening after the vaccines rolled out for that age group.

**Dr. Ryan Cole:** There was really no excess death during the covid year before the shots rolled out if you look at the numbers. It was expected respiratory death rates pretty much around the world. Then you look at Denis Rancourt's data out of Canada, and I met with him, let's see in Croatia, you know, his team, and they've done astounding data sets showing the excess deaths after the rollout of the shots. And you know, if the numbers are real, you know, the shots could have accounted for up to 17 million excess deaths. The one thing you can't hide is death in terms of the data sets around the world. I mean, death is death, and you look at average numbers per population, and then you look at what happened after the rollout of the shots, and it's pretty astounding.

**Steve Kirsch:** Yeah, I'll be publishing a substack I hope later today. I've been working around the clock on this one. I haven't published a substack on some data for a while now, and the reason is because I've been focusing on the US Medicare data and also the New Zealand data, which confirms that. And what the data is showing is that there's a sort of constant rise of deaths. It's not this, you don't see this Day Zero death like you do if you take the flu shot or if you take the Pneumococcal vaccine, for example. Both of those have Day 0 deaths, but Covid vaccine doesn't, which really surprised me because there are a lot of anaphylaxis cases after the Covid vaccine. But what we see is that the mortality rate just goes off and marches upwards, and it doesn't matter if the mortality is falling, mortality if you got the Covid is upwards. And if mortality is rising because of seasonality, it's rising even more if you got the Covid shot, and it looks like it sustained for at least two years after you got the shot, that you have this increase and then it starts going down. And we were talking before the show on a kid who was, I think was 29 years old, and he had the 10th largest heart ever seen by the person doing the autopsy, and that 29-year-old was vaccinated basically two and a half years ago, and now his heart was so large that he died in his sleep. Now, a 29-year-old dying in their sleep—like, when was that a thing? Like, have you ever heard of that before the Covid shots rolled out? Did you ever hear of a 29-year-old or a 23-year-old dying in their sleep?

**Dr. Ryan Cole:** Very rarely, and it's usually in asthmatics that I've seen that in my career where they'll have an asthma attack in their sleep, and they have, you know, a long history of some underlying condition like that. It was interesting early on after the rollout of the shots, I had one autopsy I reviewed out of another state, and the individual was a Marathon or a triathlete and passed away. He is 50-year-old exceedingly healthy athlete, and the thing that the pathologist in that state had noted on autopsy was dilated heart. And there was a Moderna study early on in mice that showed within just a few weeks, the heart just ballooning in size. And when someone's in their sleep, as you go into your waking hours and your cortisol starts to rise in the morning, your cortisol's highest in the morning, as the cortisol goes up, your heart starts to beat faster. And someone with a dilated cardiomyopathy, you know, that catecholamine release and whatnot, you can end up stressing the heart, and if you have ballooned heart like that, the amount of blood it can pump goes down precipitously.

So, I've seen it in some post-vaccine cases, and you know it's tragic. Early on, Dr. Gill when he published his article in the archives Epithology on the two teenagers that had passed, again they died in their sleep as well, so this is where some of those sudden unexpected deaths are occurring. As you go to sleep, your cortisol levels lowest and then as the heart gets the morning stress upon it, you end up being at that break point where that heart can no longer function properly. You go into an arrhythmia and then pass, unfortunately. So, it happens.

**Steve Kirsch:** Did it ever happen from Covid because this guy was diagnosed having enlarged heart myocarditis? Did you ever see a case of under 30 dying in their sleep before the Covid vaccines rolled out?

**Dr. Ryan Cole:** No.

**Steve Kirsch:** How many have you heard of? How many have you heard of since?

**Dr. Ryan Cole:** Oh, lots.

**Steve Kirsch:** Like 10, 20, 30? More than counting, more than 30?

**Dr. Ryan Cole:** Oh, me personally, well, just reading through the literature on that number of case reports here and there, I mean, there have been lots after the rollout of the shots, but of course, they will never attribute it to the shot.

**Steve Kirsch:** Of course, it's safe and effective.

本文引用视频的中文大意如下：

**Steve Kirsch:** 那么，你之前提到了突然死亡。你怎么看，你知道，大多数人在追踪这些情况上真的很糟糕，你知道的，他们被灌输了一种观念，认为人们会上[[zh:推特]]，然后他们会发一些类似的帖子，比如：“突然死亡一直都在发生，你现在才注意到是因为它成了一种现象，但它一直在发生，而且发生的速率是一样的，所有那些突然死亡的[[zh:运动员]]，这些以前都发生过，你只是以前没有意识到，因为现在你更加警觉了。”你认为[[zh:接种疫苗]]前后突然死亡的人数有多大差距？你认为增长情况如何？

**Ryan Cole** **博士:** 这取决于[[zh:国家]]和年龄组，但实际的航空数据是无法欺骗的，我认为深入研究一些保险[[zh:公司]]的数据是很重要的。某些[[zh:国家]]在年轻人群中的预期死亡人数超过平均水平的6、8、10%以上，而且仍在持续增加。这就是我担心的地方。你可能比我现在拥有更好的数据，但在某些年龄段，超过平均水平的死亡人数远高于预期，并且突然死亡的情况，是的，我们更加注意到了，你看看辛格·[[zh:辉瑞]]的[[zh:孤独]][[zh:心脏]][[zh:血栓]]团以及许多突然去世的知名媒体人士，人们会说：“嗯，那绝不是[[zh:疫苗]]的原因”，但现在我们知道[[zh:疫苗]]中的副产品蛋白可以在体内持续存在多久，来源于布鲁根斯博士的研究以及其他许多因素，比如污染的DNA，是[[zh:疫苗]]在体内引发其他代谢问题，超过平均水平的死亡和预期之外的突然死亡还在继续发生，毫无疑问。

**Steve Kirsch:** 仅在[[zh:疫苗]]针对的年龄段推出后才开始发生。

**Ryan Cole** **博士:** 在[[zh:疫苗]]推出之前的[[zh:疫情]]年度没有真正的过度死亡，如果你查看数据，在[[zh:疫苗]]推出之前，预期的呼吸道[[zh:死亡率]]在世界范围内几乎是一致的。然后你看看[[zh:加拿大]]Denis Rancourt的数据，我在[[zh:克罗地亚]]跟他见了面，他的团队，他们展示了[[zh:疫苗]]推出后的过度死亡数据集。你知道，如果数字是真实的，[[zh:疫苗]]可能已经导致多达1700万的过度死亡。你不能隐藏的是世界各地的数据集中的死亡。我是说，死亡就是死亡，你看看每个人口的平均数，然后看看[[zh:疫苗]]推出后发生了什么，这相当令人震惊。

**Steve Kirsch:** 是的，我希望今天晚些时候能发布一个Substack。我一直在夜以继日地为此奋战。我已经有一段时间没有在Substack上发布数据了，原因是我一直在关注[[zh:美国]]医疗保险数据和[[zh:新西兰]]数据，这也证实了这一点。数据显示，死亡人数呈现出一种持续上升的趋势。它并不像接种流感[[zh:疫苗]]或者例如肺炎球菌[[zh:疫苗]]那样，在第0天就发生死亡。这两者都有第0天死亡，但[[zh:新冠]][[zh:疫苗]]没有，这让我感到非常惊讶，因为[[zh:新冠]][[zh:疫苗]]后会有很多过敏症例。但我们看到的是[[zh:死亡率]]持续上升，并不在乎[[zh:死亡率]]是否下降，如果你感染了[[zh:新冠]]，[[zh:死亡率]]是上升的。如果由于季节性因素[[zh:死亡率]]正在上升，接种了[[zh:新冠]][[zh:疫苗]]后[[zh:死亡率]]会更高，看起来在[[zh:接种疫苗]]后至少两年内，[[zh:死亡率]]就会上升，然后开始下降。我们在节目之前曾谈到过一个29岁的孩子，他的[[zh:心脏]]是第10大的，做过尸检的人见过，那个29岁的人基本上是两年半前接种了[[zh:疫苗]]，现在他的[[zh:心脏]]如此庞大，以至于他在睡觉时死去了。现在，一个29岁的人在睡觉时去世——这是什么情况？在[[zh:新冠]][[zh:疫苗]]推出之前你有听说过吗？你有听说过29岁或23岁的人在睡觉时去世的情况吗？

**Ryan Cole** **博士:** 非常少见，在我的职业生活中，通常是在哮喘患者中见过这种情况，他们在睡觉时发生哮喘发作，并且有长期的这样一些潜在病情。有趣的是，在[[zh:疫苗]]推出后不久，我审查了另一个州的一例尸检，这个人是马拉松或铁人三项[[zh:运动员]]，去世了。他是一个50岁的非常健康的[[zh:运动员]]，那个州的[[zh:病理学家]]在尸检时注意到的是[[zh:心脏]]扩张。[[zh:莫德纳]]早期有一项针对小鼠的研究，显示出来，在短短几周内，[[zh:心脏]]就会膨胀增大。当一个人在睡觉时，随着你的皮质醇在早晨开始上升，你的皮质醇在早晨最高，随着皮质醇的上升，你的[[zh:心脏]]开始跳得更快。对于患有扩张性心肌病的人来说，那种[[zh:肾上腺素]]释放等等，你最终会给[[zh:心脏]]带来压力，如果你的[[zh:心脏]]膨胀得像那样，它可以泵血的数量会急剧下降。

所以我在一些[[zh:疫苗]]接种后的案例中见过这种情况，这是一个悲剧。早些时候，Gill 博士在《Archives of Epidemiology》上发表了一篇[[zh:关于]]两名青少年的文章，他们也在睡觉时去世了，这就是一些突然意外死亡的发生场所。当你入睡时，你的皮质醇水平最低，然后当[[zh:心脏]]在早晨承受压力时，你会到达那个拐点，使[[zh:心脏]]不能正常工作。你会进入[[zh:心律失常]]，然后不幸去世。这是有发生的。

**Steve Kirsch:** 这是否曾经是因为[[zh:新冠病毒]]感染引起的呢？因为这个人被诊断患有扩张性[[zh:心肌炎]]？你在[[zh:新冠]]推出之前有见过这种情况吗，30岁以下在睡觉时去世的情况？

**Ryan Cole** **博士:** 没有。

**Steve Kirsch:** 你听说过多少个？自从之后听说了多少？

**Ryan Cole** **博士:** 噢，很多。

**Steve Kirsch:** 像10、20、30个？超过30个吗？

**Ryan Cole** **博士:** 噢，我个人认识的，啊，只是在读这些案例报告时，我的意思是，在[[zh:疫苗]]推出之后，有很多这样的案例，

但当然他们永远不会把这归因于[[zh:疫苗]]。

**Steve Kirsch:** 当然了，它是安全有效的（讽刺）。
