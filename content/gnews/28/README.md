咱们很多人来看这个问题时候，对阿富汗人讲是个灾难
When many of us look at this issue that it’s a disaster for the Afghans

对待很多人道上绝对是灾难，我有很多朋友，你也知道我一直关注这个事情
It is definitely a disaster for humanity, I have many friends there and you know that I have been following this matter

但作为美国来讲，说实在话一定要看到
But to be honest as the United States is concerned, we must see

阿富汗将近从过去的1000多万人到2000万人口，到最后美国在那儿驻军
Afghanistan has grown from a population of more than 10 million in the past to a population of 20 million, to the end where the United States stationed troops there

每年花了几千亿进去，到变成了将近5000万人口，人口增长
that US has spent hundreds of billions dollars in there every year, and it has become a population of nearly 50 million, the population has grown

塔利班才多少人，号称所谓80万大军，实际上就30几万人
How many are the Taliban? The so-called 800,000 army is actually only 300,000 people

一个5000万人的国家，被30万人给蹂躏着要饿死一半人
A country of 50 million people are ravaged by 300,000 people and half of them will starve to death

就像我们中国人，14亿人被所谓的3000多个人民代表和中央政治局被七个常委就给全国人民
Just like us Chinese people, 1.4 billion people are represented by the so-called more than 3000 people’s representatives and the whole nation is represented by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee by seven Standing Com-mittees

宇宙无限大，地球是一粒沙，全给强奸了，一睡就睡了70年
The universe is infinitely large, and the earth is a grain of sand, the whole country’s people are all been raped by CCP, and has been ravaged for 70 years

同样的悲哀的结果，凭啥美国人要让你阿富汗强大我拿钱
The same sad situation, why the Americans want spend money to make Af-ghanistan（China） strong

美国再在阿富汗待下去，你知道什么结果，你觉得会有什么结果
If the U.S. stays in Afghanistan, you know what the outcome will be, what do you think will be the outcome？

从这个道德上讲，绝对是不对的，从任何角度讲
From this moral point of view, it is absolutely wrong about the withdrawal, from any other point of view

从阿富汗撤出，美国撤出是符合美国利益
the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan is in the interests of the United States

更重要的事情美国除了经济问题，除了战略问题，美国是真的再往下弄下去
The more important thing is that in addition to economic issues and strategic issues, if the United States is really staying further

美国知道在阿富汗这个地方，美国会深陷其中，而且美国绝对是就是20年的计划
The United States knows that in Afghanistan, the United States will be stuck in it, and the United States is definitely only has a 20-year plan

就是要对付，要把伊朗、中国共产党这个彻底改掉
It is to completely get rid of Iran and the Chinese Communist Party

把整个中东的整个局势彻底改变，它没有那么多精力和金钱，不可能的
Completely change the entire situation in the entire Middle East, it doesn’t have so much energy and money, it’s impossible

美国这已经搞了30年就准备好打赢绝对打赢一场战争，准备同时打两场战争
The United States has been doing this for 30 years and is ready to win a war, and is ready to fight two wars at the same time

在阿富汗你就同时在一场战争中，你怎么可能
In Afghanistan you are in a war at the same time, how could you do it?

你5000万多阿富汗人，干不掉30万多这小块, 加一起不过10万人的那些所谓的人
More than 50 million Afghans can’t get rid of the small piece of more than 300,000 and the so-called Taliban who are less than 100,000

都不会打的，吃都能把它吃了，甭说打了
Afghans don’t need to fight, they can eat them alive, not even mention to fight

所以回答这个问题很简单，美国的安全和战略经济的基本需要
So the answer to this question is very simple, the basic needs of American secu-rity and strategic economy

和阿富汗现在即将触发的巨大的问题
and the huge problems that Afghanistan is about to trigger
