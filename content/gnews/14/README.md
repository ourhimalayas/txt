在各国强推中共CCP病毒疫苗很长一段时间后，根据[Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org)整理的[霍普金斯大学](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)数据统计结果研究表明，注射疫苗既不能预防感染，也不能减少死亡。而与各国政府宣传的恰恰相反，病毒感染和死亡线性相关，疫苗没有任何作用；未接种疫苗人群完全可以依靠身体自身免疫力达到群体免疫效果；接种疫苗不但对预防感染和死亡没有任何帮助，反而有可能增加了治愈难度；接种疫苗半年后，感染病毒、死亡风险都呈几何级数增长。

那么，各国政府为什么要强推疫苗，强推疫苗背后是否存在黑暗势力的操控，印度[Wion Gravitas](https://www.wionews.com)电视台7分32秒的节目揭开了其中的冰山一角……

2021年10月21日，印度[Wion Gravitas](https://www.wionews.com)电视台暴光辉瑞制药如何欺负勒索各国政府在中共CCP病毒疫苗上做出屈辱的让步。Gravitas主播 Palki Sharma Upadhyay通过展示的几份辉瑞制药和多个国家政府签订的9份合同，揭露辉瑞制药公司在迫使政府保持沉默、抑制供应、转移风险方面取得了成功，并在一个世纪以来最严重的公共卫生危机中实现利润最大化。

这些合同包括：阿尔巴尼亚50万剂，单价12美元，总金额为600万美元；2021年3月15日同巴西政府的1亿剂，单价10美元，总金额为10亿美元；2021年2月2日同哥伦比亚政府签订的1000万剂，单价12美元，总金额1.2亿美元；2020的12月1日智利政府签订的1000万剂；2020年10月29日，多米尼加政府签订的800万剂，单价12美元，总金额9600万美元；2020年11月20日，欧盟签订的2亿剂，单价18.6美元，总金额37亿美元；2020年9月17日，秘鲁政府签订的1000万剂，单价12美元，总金额1.2亿美元；2020年7月21日，美国政府签订的1亿剂，单价19.5美元，总金额19.5亿美元；英国政府2020年10月20日签订的3000万剂。

这些合同明确包括以下条款：

1.    政府不得透露正在强推疫苗与辉瑞制药公司的交易内容。

2.    辉瑞严格控制供应。例如，巴西政府被限制接受来自其他国家的辉瑞疫苗捐赠或未经辉瑞许可从其他国家购买辉瑞疫苗。巴西政府也被限制在未经辉瑞公司许可的情况下捐赠、分发、出口或以其他方式将疫苗运输到巴西境外。

3.    辉瑞为自己争取了“知识产权豁免”。在几份合同中，辉瑞可以随意使用任何人的知识产权——基本上没有任何后果。至少有四个国家需要“赔偿、捍卫辉瑞并使辉瑞免受伤害”，使其免受与疫苗知识产权相关的任何和所有诉讼、索赔、诉讼、要求、损害、成本和费用。

4.    私人仲裁员，而不是公共法庭，秘密裁决争议，而阿尔巴尼亚、巴西、智利、哥伦比亚、多米尼加共和国和秘鲁的协议甚至要求合同纠纷须由适用纽约法律的 ICC 仲裁。

5.    国家资产作担保。辉瑞要求巴西、智利、哥伦比亚、多米尼加共和国和秘鲁放弃主权豁免。

6.    辉瑞在关键决策上发号施令。如果疫苗供应短缺怎么办？在阿尔巴尼亚的合同草案以及巴西和哥伦比亚的协议中，辉瑞将根据公司决定的原则决定对交货时间表的调整。阿尔巴尼亚、巴西和哥伦比亚“应被视为同意任何修改”。

依笔者看来，印度Wion Gravitas节目只是揭露了各国政府强与辉瑞制药公司签订不平等合同的细节，并未真正深入问题的核心。无论如何，让普通民众知道背后的真相，思考和反问政府强推疫苗的深层原因。

在全世界各国政府步调如此一致强推中共CCP病毒疫苗的背后是否存在某种黑暗势力在操控？各国政府为什么要与辉瑞制药公司签订如此不公平的合同，这些如此屈辱的合同背后，究竟隐藏了多少秘密，应该才是人们真正想知道的答案！

正如主持人节目最后提到的那样，疫苗就是恐怖主义！

附：印度Wion Gravitas节目文字内容全文听写

Wuhan virus vaccines are supposed to be a global public good. But what happens when a vaccine manufacturer starts bullying? Governments are silenced. suppliers have altered and profit state proceedings overstating lives. I’m not describing a hypothetical situation here. I’m describing what Pfizer is doing. The American pharma giant it is doing all of this is bullying countries to submit its demands.

We first reported about this back in February this year. Well, countries like India are sending feedback seems to coronations. There are companies like Pfizer, which are bullying governments, Pfizer asked to be compensated for the cost of any future lawsuits. Pfizer wanted Argentina to put a listen to this, put its bank reserves, its military bases, and its embassy buildings at stake as collateral. These are Pfizer’s demands. Look at this number one, Brazil reserves the sovereignity of its assets abroad in favor of Pfizer, that the rules of the land be not applied on Pfizer. Number three, that Brazil take into consideration a delay in delivery. Number four, that Pfizer is not penalized for it for a delay in delivery. And number five, in case of any side effect Pfizer be exempted from all civil liability.

Eight months had passed since we reported this Pfizer has not changed it is still putting profits about public health. It is still forcing governments to bend to its will and advocacy group has thrown up more details on what Pfizer does. It has access to confidential contracts of Pfizer, and we have a copy. These contracts are with nine countries and blocks and the details are shocking. Desperate countries are being forced to make humiliating concessions to Pfizer.

We went through the entire report you have found six very important points worth highlighting. Number one, Pfizer has the right to silence governments. It has forced countries to not talk about the deals they strike for shots. Number two, Pfizer controls the donations of its shots, not the country that buys them finally, decide where the shots go. Number three, Pfizer has secured an intellectual property waiver for itself and this clause is particularly disturbing. Pfizer is accused of intellectual property theft, governments will pay not the company. Number four, if there are disputes, private arbitrators, and not what the courts will decide on them. Number five, Pfizer can go after state assets to secure its compensation and number six, Pfizer calls the shots on all key decisions. It decides delivery timelines and more.

These are very serious revelations. I’ll give you some more details. Number one, Pfizer is silencing governments how? Through contracts. These airtight contracts are at the center of everything. They can silence governments in ways you can’t even imagine. Look at what happened in Brazil. Pfizer agreed to supply its Wuhan virus vaccines to Brazil. And it’s made them this clause in the agreement to force Brazil to not share any specifics about its deal with Pfizer.

Let me read it out for you. This is what it says the Brazilian government is prohibited from making any public announcement concerning the existence subject matter or terms of the agreement or commenting on its relationship with Pfizer without the prior written consent of the company. In other words, Brazil cannot talk about the Pfizer deal until it gets an approval from Pfizer in writing. This basically is a private company, muzzling a government, and that’s not all. Pfizer also gets to decide who will give the shot. Suppose someone wants to donate Pfizer shots to Brazil. Can they do it? They cannot. The Pfizer agreement restricts Brazil from accepting donations, no one can donate Pfizer vaccines to this country. They cannot use the Pfizer shot until they buy it.

What happens if Brazil does not comply with these rules? The consequences will be serious. Let me quote from the report again.

If Brazil were to accept donated doses without Pfizer’s permission, it would be considered an uninsurable material breach of their agreement, allowing Pfizer to immediately terminate the agreement upon termination. Brazilwood required to pay this prize for any remaining contracted doses. So Brazil will have to cover the entire payment. And Pfizer won’t even have to supply the full consignment of Wuhan virus shots. What happens if someone accuses Pfizer of stealing its vaccine technology of intellectual property theft? The government will be forced to defend Pfizer it’s unbelievable.

We had to read this twice to let it sink in. And guess what, at least four countries have been forced to protect Pfizer’s patent, meaning these governments are defending Pfizer for intellectual property theft.

While the company is free to use anyone’s intellectual property, as it pleases, Columbia is one of these victims. I’ll explain with an example suppose a domestic vaccine maker or a pharma company in Colombia goes to court and then accused Pfizer of infringing their vaccine.

Who will be the one fighting that case? Not Pfizer, even though they accused party it’s not Pfizer and their lawyers will be in court. It will be the Colombian government. The government will have to defend Pfizer and if they lose it Government that we have to pay the settlement, not Pfizer. What did these governments want to get out of these tough contracts? They won’t be able to sue Pfizer at all. The matter will go to a secret panel of three private arbitrators. Pfizer will be tried as per New York law and not the laws of the land where it says vaccines. And these countries will pay heavily if they lose an arbitration. Pfizer can ask a government to shift control of state assets to compensate for losses, what kind of assets are we talking? About here? practically anything that a sovereign government owns foreign bank accounts, foreign investments, commercial properties, state owned airlines, even oil companies, Pfizer can take over any or all of these from a government basically everything happens on Pfizer terms once a country decides to buy its vaccine. Even the delivery of shots is decided by the company in Brazil in Albania and Colombia. Pfizer gets to decide the delivery timetable for vaccines and the countries will have to agree to whatever they’re given whenever they’re given. Pfizer of course gets to decide the price. It sets the delivery timelines, it accepts accountability for nothing, and in case someone sues the company, it’s the government that foots the bill for the damages, not Pfizer. There is no other way to describe Pfizer’s business practices.

This is vaccine terrorism.
