"We have about 800 papers total on this whole topic of hyper vaccination and Autism, and whether or not it's related. And now we have 5 papers that do the opposite. This is very important. 5 papers that do the opposite and test children who go natural. So, children in modern day era who take no shots. So that'd be Mawson, Miller, Hooker, Thomas, and then the older Amish study. All showing natural kids who take no shots much lower rates of atopic dermatitis, need for tympanostomy tubes, need for antibiotics for pharyngitis, lesser food allergies, lesser asthma, and lower rates of neuropsychiatric syndromes including autism. So just the empiric observational data would suggest if you're a young parent today you want your child to be as healthy as possible, you'd actually skip the vaccines."

【我们在这个超级接种和自闭症的整个话题上共有大约800篇论文，以确定它们是否有关。现在我们有5篇文章相反的结果。这很重要。这5篇文章对自然生长的儿童进行了测试，他们不[[zh:接种疫苗]]。这包括Mawson、Miller、Hooker、Thomas以及较早的阿米什人研究。所有这些研究都显示，不[[zh:接种疫苗]]的自然生长的孩子在特应性皮炎、鼓室通气管需求、咽喉炎需求抗生素、食物过敏、哮喘以及包括自闭症在内的神经精神症状的发病率都要低得多。因此，根据经验性观察数据，如果你是今天的年轻父母，你希望你的孩子尽可能地健康，你实际上会跳过[[zh:疫苗]]。

推文所附视频的英文原文如下：

**Ashley**: Dr. Peter McCullough, I wanted to get your take, an update on the state of our American healthcare system. We've seen persecution and a takeover of practicing healthcare professionals like yourself and Dr. Tenpenny. There were some things I did want to bring up with a certain healthcare system, but I cannot do that. Understandable. We've seen Big Pharma takeover, and as you mentioned, the future healthcare professionals that are currently in the hospitals. But the future healthcare professionals... I've talked with a lot of nursing students who seem a little confused, maybe a little timid as to what's going on. They don't know which way to look, who to believe. What are your thoughts on all of this as to where we are today, like you said at the European Parliament? I mean, we were going on our third year into this tragedy we've been witnessing unfold before our eyes.

**Dr. Peter McCull****ough**: Well, you know, that's a valid point. Just the time, so the pandemic now is 4 years old, the vaccine debacle is three years old. I mean, that's a long period of time. That's almost the entire time you go through nursing school. You know, people want to look to authority and be able to trust authority figures, whether there be leaders in Madison, medical schools, nursing schools, public health agencies; they've lost their trust. We just gave the example of the Nobel Prize laureate for messenger RNA, who doesn't even know how long it lasted in the body, and when he guessed, he guessed wrong, and he wins a Nobel Prize for a wrong guess. I mean, this is just absolutely astounding. But it is occurring in the context of something important historically. We're about 150 years into historically, into what I call vaccine ideology, and vaccine I started out with Dr Edward Jenner and then Louis Pestor, vaccine ideology says the human body is inherently frail and vulnerable and that man can improve upon one's health by multiple vaccinations. And the same vaccine ideology, by the way, is extended to our pets and livestock. That again, these animals are inherently vulnerable, so they need shots. Well, come on, you look at other animals in nature; they're not giving each other shots; they're out there living to the extent that they live healthy lives. And this vaccine ideology has over 150 years has been promulgated with a real mantra that it cannot be challenged. So once vaccines come on the market, they can't be challenged, they're never removed, outside of the rare circumstance of the smallpox vaccine. And the smallpox vaccine program was 70 years, by the way. And then the swine flu, I mean, this wine fluid had actually had a failed vaccine back in the , it was a primordial vaccine back in early 1900s, but even I take it back the Spanish flu had a primordial vaccine back in the early 1900s, Swine flu had a vaccine that was removed from the human market by President Ford, but here we are today with more and more vaccines for children, yet the infectious disease threats aren't there with modern sewer sanitation water we don't have a polio threat, we don't have diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella. I mean, those are just simply not threats, and every single one of those illnesses largely went away before the vaccines came out. So it was really due to cleaner living.

Same thing is true with livestock, by the way; some naturopathic veterinarians think we need no shots for cattle or other livestock. But this vaccine ideology has been bruly, cannot be challenged, has not had an eye toward safety. We have had now, I think we're up to about 200 papers linking immune system disregulation to a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Asperger's, autism spectrum disorder, as well as some motor and neurologic disorders immune system. We have about 800 papers total in this whole topic of hyper-vaccination and autism and whether or not it's related. And now we have five papers that do the opposite, it's very important, five papers that do the opposite and test children who go natural, so children in the modern-day era who take no shots. So that be Mossin, Miller, Hooker, Thomas, and then an older Amish study, all showing natural kids who take no shots have much lower rates of atopic dermatitis, need for tympanostomy tubes, need for antibiotics for pharyngitis, lesser food allergies, lesser asthma, and lower rates of neuropsychiatric syndromes, including autism.

So, I mean, just the empirical observational data would suggest if you're a young parent today and you want your child to be as healthy as possible, you'd actually skip the vaccines. And the World Council for Health, in the last month, has finally issued guidance on this, saying, listen, now that messenger RNA has been added to the childhood schedule, and messenger RNA is very dangerous, that parents should decline all the vaccines for the children, take a wait and see approach until some of this madness starts to calm down.

**Ashley**: Absolutely. I actually stopped vaccinating my 7-year-old son back in late 2018, and Dr. McCullough, I've got to tell you, his pediatrician was not happy. I mean, he did everything he can just to convince me otherwise, and this was just over the flu vaccine. I was like you. Give me a break.

**Dr. Peter McCull****ough**: Various influenza, you know, a paper by Chen and colleagues in 2022 showed the flu vaccine has a vaccine efficacy against severe outcomes of zero, statistically insignificant zero. Basically, the flu shot doesn't work. And we're not anti-vaxxers; we've become vaccine risk-aware now. I can tell you, I took all the shots, I took all the shots, I'm 60 years old; I've been a doctor. I took 40 years of flu shots because I had to be in the hospital, I was forced into this, so I'm not an anti-vaxxer, I'm a pincushion. I've taken so many shots; it's impossible for anybody to call me an anti-vaxxer. But I am now vaccine risk-aware. My kids growing up took all the shots; I didn't look at it critically. But if I was a young parent today, based on where we are, especially with the dangerous messenger RNA being on the routine schedule, I would decline all the shots; I would follow the World Council for Health.

**Ashley**:Thank you for that. And even just pulling up here from Epoch Health, infectious diseases, potent neurotoxins... Am I saying this right, the thiomersal?

**Dr. Peter McCull****ough**: Yeah, thiomersal.

**Ashley**:Yeah,it's still being used in some flu vaccines. I kind of find that hard to believe because I just feel like we are where we are today since Covid, and there's been no transparency.

本段视频对应的中文大意是：

**Ashley:** Dr. Peter McCullough，我想听听您的看法，[[zh:关于]]我们[[zh:美国]]医疗保健系统的现状更新。我们已经看到了对像您和Dr. Tenpenny这样的执业医疗保健专业人员的迫害和接管。我确实想提出一些[[zh:关于]]某个特定医疗系统的问题，但我无法这样做。可以理解。我们已经看到了大型[[zh:制药]][[zh:公司]]的接管，正如您提到的，目前医院里的未来医疗专业人员。但未来的医疗专业人员......我已经与很多护理学生交谈，他们似乎有点困惑，也许对发生的事情有点胆怯。他们不知道往哪里看，也不知道该相信谁。对于我们今天的境况，您有什么看法，就像您在[[zh:欧洲议会]]所说的那样？我是说，我们已经经历了这场悲剧已经进入第三个年头了。

**Dr. Peter McCullough:** 嗯，您知道，这是一个有效的观点。现在正是时候，现在大流行已经4年了，[[zh:疫苗]]的困境已经有3年了，这实际上是相当长的一段时间。这几乎就是您在护理学校学习的全部时间。人们希望寻求权威，能够信任权威人士，无论是麦迪逊的领导人、医学院、护理学校还是[[zh:公共卫生机构]]；他们失去了信任。我们刚刚举了一个例子，Nobel Prize的mRNA信使RNA奖获得者甚至不知道它在体内持续多长时间，当他猜测时，他猜错了，但他因错误的猜测获得了Nobel奖。我是说，这实在令人震惊。但这发生在一个[[zh:历史]]上重要的背景下。我们已经进入[[zh:历史]]上大约150年的[[zh:疫苗]][[zh:意识形态]]，我从爱德华·詹纳博士和路易·巴斯德开始了[[zh:疫苗]]的研究。[[zh:疫苗]]的[[zh:意识形态]]认为人体天生虚弱和易受伤害 ，人可以通过多次接种来改善自己的健康。同样的[[zh:疫苗]]思想，顺便说一下，也延伸到了我们的宠物和牲畜。这些动物也天生脆弱，所以它们需要注射。来吧，你看看[[zh:大自然]]中的其他动物；它们不互相注射；它们在那里过着健康的生活，只要它们健康地生活下去。这种[[zh:疫苗]]思想已经传播了150多年，有一种真正的舍不得被挑战的理念，因此一旦[[zh:疫苗]]上市，它们就不能被挑战，它们永远不会被撤下[[zh:市场]]，除了[[zh:天花]][[zh:疫苗]]这种罕见情况以外。[[zh:天花]][[zh:疫苗]]计划持续了70年，顺便说一下。然后是猪流感，我的意思是，猪流感实际上在早期1900年代就有一个原始的[[zh:疫苗]]，但即使是[[zh:西班牙]]流感也在20世纪初有一个原始的[[zh:疫苗]]，猪流感的[[zh:疫苗]]曾被[[zh:福特总统]]从人类[[zh:市场]]上撤下，但今天，我们为儿童提供了越来越多的[[zh:疫苗]]，尽管现代下水道卫生和清洁水已经没有传染病威胁，我们不再面临[[zh:脊髓]]灰质炎、[[zh:百白破]]、[[zh:麻疹]]、流行性腮腺炎、风疹威胁。我的意思是，这些疾病实际上并不构成威胁，而且在[[zh:疫苗]]问世之前，这些疾病大部分都已经消失了。这实际上是由于更健康的生活方式引起的。

同样的情况也发生在牲畜身上，顺便说一下；一些自然疗法兽医认为，我们不需要为牛或其他牲畜[[zh:接种疫苗]]。但是这种[[zh:疫苗]]思想无法挑战，它并没有关注安全性。到目前为止，我们已经有大约200篇论文将[[zh:免疫系统]]失调与各种神经精神疾病联系起来，包括注意力不足多动症（ADHD）、亚斯伯格综合症、自闭症谱系障碍，以及一些运动和神经系统疾病[[zh:免疫系统]]。我们总共有大约800篇论文，涵盖了过度接种和自闭症是否有关的整个主题。现在我们有五篇相反的论文，这很重要，五篇相反的论文测试了不[[zh:接种疫苗]]的儿童，所以在现代不接种任何[[zh:疫苗]]的儿童中，所以这就是莫辛，米勒，胡克，托马斯，然后是较老的对阿米什人的研究，都显示未[[zh:接种疫苗]]的孩子，他们患特应性皮炎、需要鼓膜通气管、需要用于咽喉炎的抗生素、食物过敏、哮喘和神经精神综合症的发病率要低得多，包括自闭症。

所以，我是说，基于经验性的观察数据，如果你是今天的年轻父母，你想要你的孩子尽可能地健康，那么你实际上应该忽略[[zh:疫苗]]。在过去的一个月里，世界卫生委员会终于发布了这方面的指导意见，称mRNA已被加入到儿童日程表中，而mRNA是非常危险的，因此父母应该拒绝为孩子接种所有[[zh:疫苗]]，采取等待和观望的方法，直到这种疯狂开始逐渐平息。

**Ashley:**绝对，实际上，我在2018年底就停止为我7岁的儿子[[zh:接种疫苗]]了，而Dr. McCullough，我必须告诉您，他的儿科医生非常不高兴。我是说，他尽了一切努力来说服我，这仅仅是[[zh:关于]]流感[[zh:疫苗]]的事情，我很抱歉，给我一个休止吧。

**Dr. Peter McCullough:** 各种流感，你知道，Chen等人在2022年的一篇论文中显示，流感[[zh:疫苗]]对严重结果的[[zh:疫苗]]效力为零，统计学上来说是零。基本上，流感[[zh:疫苗]]没有效果。而我们并不是反[[zh:疫苗]]者，我们现在已经意识到了[[zh:疫苗]]的风险。我可以告诉您，我接受了所有的[[zh:疫苗]]，我已经60岁了，我是一名医生，我接种了40年的流感[[zh:疫苗]]，因为我必须在医院工作，我被迫这样做，所以我不是反[[zh:疫苗]]者，我是个扎针垫子。我接受了那么多的针，没有人可以称我为反[[zh:疫苗]]者。但现在我意识到了[[zh:疫苗]]的风险。我孩子长大后接受了所有的[[zh:疫苗]]，我没有进行深入的研究。但如果我是今天的年轻父母，基于我们目前的情况，特别是危险的mRNA已经加入到例行日程表中，我会拒绝所有的[[zh:疫苗]]，我会遵循世界卫生委员会的指导。

Ashley: 感谢您。从Epoch Health这里得出，传染病，强大的神经毒素...我是否说得对，硫汞胂？

**Dr. Peter McCullough:** 是的，硫汞胂。

**Ashley:** 是的，它仍然在一些流感[[zh:疫苗]]中使用，我觉得有点难以置信，因为我觉得我们自从Covid以来所处的境地，完全没有透明度。
