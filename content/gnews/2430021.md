以下为引用视频的全英文纪要：

**Elizabeth:** I'm just going to show everybody, just so they can see, that's the book that came out at the end of last year, I think, with Bobby Kennedy. So, that's the main thing in today's conversation, but there's a few other things because Brian's been involved with the vaccine safety area for quite a while.

So, in actual fact, a story that really interests me is a story with a doctor called Doctor William Thompson, which I mentioned in the introduction. And I think a lot of our viewers might not know who Dr. William Thompson is because this is an old story that goes back to a 2004 study. Dr. William Thompson was working for the CDC, the CDC scientist. So, can you tell us a little bit about a brief description of what Dr. William Thompson was doing with that 2004 study and how you became involved in that story?

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Okay, well, you know, I really appreciate the opportunity to tell that story. Dr. Thompson started working on this paper. The paper was published in 2004, and it was a paper regarding the timing of giving the MMR vaccine to infants and its association to later getting an autism diagnosis. And when the paper came out, it said that there was no relationship between the timing of the MMR vaccine and autism, and it was a very curious conclusion because even the data tables themselves did not support that conclusion. It did show that children who received the MMR on time were at least 150% more likely to get an autism diagnosis compared to those children that were the MMR was just delayed until after they were three years of age.

And so, I remember it being a very dubious study. It came out in the Journal of Pediatrics, which is sort of an advertising arm of the American Academy of Pediatrics. And I remember, you know, notably that the conclusions did not match the data tables themselves, and so that kind of stuck out in my mind. Well, at that point in time, I wasn't really the MMR guy, and I was much more concerned about mercury in vaccines. You know, my son was injured by primarily by mercury in his childhood vaccines, although I do think that the MMR played a role in his autism. But early on, I was focused on mercury. So, I didn't pay that too much attention.

But then in 2013, all of a sudden, I received a phone call on my cell phone. I was in my office at the university, and it was one Dr. William Thompson. And Dr. Thompson had gotten my phone number. We had been in contact earlier, much, much earlier, you know, back in 2001 and 2002, when I had some questions regarding mercury in vaccines. But I hadn't really heard from him in over 11 years, and so all of a sudden, my phone rings, and it's Dr. Thompson.

And he really starts confessing almost immediately. I mean, we had this sort of running conversation over 10 months, and he was interested in getting me data so I could reanalyze the results of some of the key CDC studies that had been used to absolve vaccines from the autism epidemic. But he told me, he said, "I want you to look at this MMR paper first." And so I did. I looked at the data and he and I got on the phone after I had looked at the data and analyzed the data, and I said, "Hey, did you find a specific relationship involving African American males?" And he immediately said, "Oh, you found it." And I said, "Well, I found what? What did you, what did I find? You tell me. And I think that you've kind of set me up to find something. " And he described that back in 2001, as early as 2001, they knew that African American males were about 3.5 times, that's 350 times percent, more likely to get an autism diagnosis if they got that MMR on time versus if they just delayed it until after three years of age.

**Elizabeth:** Can you stop there? Because that's just blowing my mind. So, they knew in 2001, that's before his 2004 study.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Right.

**Elizabeth:** 3.5 times more likely to get autism.

If they got their shot at the normal time, if they just delayed till they were 3, they were far better off because normally they would get that shot. In those days, they would have gotten them at what 12 months?

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Between 12 and 15 months of age. That was the CDC recommendation.

**Elizabeth:** So they're sitting on that information and they did nothing.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** They did absolutely nothing. In fact, according to Thomson, they went back and forth over the information and then, ultimately, nine months after the finding, you know after Thomson made the finding, they took all evidence of it and they shredded it. They took all computer evidence and erased it. They took all physical evidence and put it in these big blue dumpsters so it could be shredded. And then by the Grace of God Dr. Thompson, who has a conscience, kept the information on his computer. And so he was able then to share it with me much, much later, you know, in 2013.

**Elizabeth:** Can I stop and check that? That 2,001 data, he shared the data with you? You've got that data?

**Dr Brian Hooker:** I do have that information. I have his printouts. I have the data tables that he presented at the research meetings with key CDC officials who were in charge of monitoring the autism epidemic and finding what was causing the autism epidemic. They knew and yet they denied it and they destroyed all those results.

**Elizabeth:** Wow, this story is so much worse than I think I thought. Well, this is because, you know why Brian, because I can't see this information on the internet. I looked, I'm pretty good at looking too. What you just told me then I didn't find, I didn't know that. I only knew about the 2004 study.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** Right, right. But 2001 was they, you know, if you think if they would have come clean with this information, it was November 7, 2001 when they made the discovery. And I estimate in the United States alone they would have saved over 200,000 autism diagnoses. And there would be 200,000 African American males right now that would not have autism if they would have come clean with that information. And so there's a lot of blood on their hands.

**Elizabeth:** So 200,000 African Americans with autism since 2,001.

**Dr Brian Hooker:** So I estimate that's not all of them, but I estimate that's how many autism cases they would have prevented if they would have come clean with that information. And they also found a relationship between what's called regressive autism, which is which is a, you know about 80% of all autism is regressive, you know you're not born with it, you actually develop normally like my son did and then you regress after a period of time, you know, presumably after vaccination. And so they saw a strong relationship that those children who regressed into autism were also getting their MMR on time. And about the relative risk was about 2.5 times higher if you got the MMR on time versus if you waited until after 3 years of age. So it was, it wasn't as profound as the African American boys but it was a very, very profound signal and they buried it. They did not publish that when they came out with the paper in 2004.

以下为引用视频的中文大意：

**Elizabeth:** 我只是想向大家展示一下，让他们看到，那是去年年底出版的书，我想，和鲍比·[[zh:肯尼迪]]一起。所以，今天谈话的主要内容就是这个，但还有一些其他事情，因为布莱恩在[[zh:疫苗]]安全领域已经参与了相当长的时间。

事实上，一个真正让我感兴趣的故事是[[zh:关于]]一个名叫威廉·汤普森博士的故事，我在介绍中提到过。我想我们很多观众可能不知道威廉·汤普森博士是谁，因为这是一个追溯到2004年的一项研究的古老的故事。威廉·汤普森博士曾在[[zh:美国疾病控制与预防中心]]（CDC）工作，是一名CDC[[zh:科学家]]。那么，您能否简要描述一下威廉·汤普森博士在那个2004年研究中做了什么，以及您如何参与到这个故事中的？

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 好的，您知道，我真的很感激有机会讲述这个故事。汤普森博士开始着手这篇论文。这篇论文发表于2004年，是[[zh:关于]]给婴儿接种[[zh:麻疹]]风疹[[zh:疫苗]]（MMR）的时间与后来被诊断为自闭症之间的关联的论文。当这篇论文发表时，它说接种MMR[[zh:疫苗]]的时间与自闭症之间没有关系，这是一个非常奇怪的结论，因为即使数据表本身也不支持这个结论。它确实显示，接种MMR[[zh:疫苗]]的儿童至少比那些MMR[[zh:疫苗]]推迟到他们三岁后才接种的儿童被诊断为自闭症的可能性高出至少150％。

所以，我记得这是一个非常可疑的研究。它发表在《儿科杂志》上，这本是[[zh:美国]]儿[[zh:科学]]会的一个广告工具。我记得，尤其是结论与数据表本身不匹配，所以这在我脑海中格外引人注目。那时候，我并不是MMR的专家，我更关心[[zh:疫苗]]中的汞。您知道，我的儿子主要是由于童年[[zh:疫苗]]中的汞受伤的，尽管我确实认为MMR对他的自闭症起到了一定作用。但早期，我主要关注的是汞。所以，我并没有太在意这个。

但是，突然间，2013年，我的手机接到了一通电话。我在大学的办公室里，电话是威廉·汤普森博士打来的。汤普森博士得到了我的电话号码。我们之前联系过，在很久很久以前联系过，你知道，大约在2001年和2002年，我对[[zh:疫苗]]中的汞有一些疑问。但是在过去的11年里，我几乎没有听到他的消息，突然间，我的电话响了，是汤普森博士。

他几乎立即开始坦白。我是说，我们在10个月内进行了这种持续的对话，他有兴趣给我提供数据，以便我重新分析一些关键CDC研究的结果，这些研究被用来解脱[[zh:疫苗]]对自闭症流行的责任。但他告诉我，他说，“我希望你首先看看这篇MMR论文。” 所以我看了一下数据，我分析了数据，然后我和他通了电话，我说：“嘿，你找到了涉及非裔[[zh:美国]]男性的具体关系吗？” 他立刻说：“哦，你找到了。” 我说：“那么，我找到了什么？你告诉我。我认为你已经为我找到了一些东西。” 他描述说，早在2001年，甚至更早，他们就知道，如果非裔[[zh:美国]]男性按时接种MMR[[zh:疫苗]]，他们被诊断为自闭症的可能性要高出大约3.5倍，即350％，与如果他们推迟到三岁后再接种相比。

**Elizabeth:** 你可以停下来吗？因为这简直让我大开眼界。所以，他们在2001年就知道了，那是在他2004年的研究之前。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 对。

**Elizabeth:** 他们在正常时间接种的话，患自闭症的可能性增加3.5倍。如果他们推迟到三岁再接种，他们会好得多，因为通常他们会在那时接种。那时候，他们会在什么时候接种？12个月吗？

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 在12到15个月的年龄之间。那是CDC的建议。

**Elizabeth:** 所以他们对这些信息视若无睹，什么都没做。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 他们绝对什么都没做。实际上，根据汤普森的说法，他们来回犹豫过这些信息，然后，最终，在发现后九个月，你知道，在汤普森发现后九个月，他们把所有的证据都销毁了。他们把所有的电脑证据都删除了。他们把所有的[[zh:物理]]证据都放在这些大蓝色的垃圾箱里，以便销毁。但是，在[[zh:上帝]]的恩典下，汤普森博士有良知，他保留了电脑上的信息。因此，他在很久很久以后能够与我分享这些信息，你知道，是在2013年。

**Elizabeth:** 我可以停下来确认一下吗？2001年的数据，他与你分享了数据？你有那些数据吗？

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 我确实有这些信息。我有他的打印输出。我有他在与负责监测自闭症流行病并找出自闭症流行病原因的关键CDC官员的研究会议上展示的数据表。他们知道，但他们否认了这一点，并销毁了所有这些结果。

**Elizabeth:** 哇，这个故事比我想象的要糟糕得多。嗯，这是因为，你知道为什么，因为我在互联网上找不到这些信息。我找过，我在找方面还是挺在行的。你刚刚告诉我的我没有找到，我不知道。我只知道2004年的研究。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 对，对。但是2001年，你知道，如果他们公开这些信息，那是2001年[[zh:11月7日]]他们发现的。我估计仅在[[zh:美国]]，他们就可以挽救超过20万个自闭症诊断。如果他们公开了这些信息，现在就会有20万个非裔[[zh:美国]]男性没有自闭症。所以他们手上沾满鲜血。

**Elizabeth:** 所以自2001年以来，有20万名[[zh:非裔美国人]]患有自闭症。

**Dr Brian Hooker:** 我估计这并不是所有的情况，但我估计如果他们公开了这些信息，他们将可以预防多达20万个自闭症病例。他们还发现了一种被称为退化性自闭症的关系，这是一种，你知道大约80％的自闭症是退化性的，你不是天生就有的，你实际上是正常发育的，就像我的儿子一样，然后在一段时间后你退化了，你知道，大概是在[[zh:接种疫苗]]后。所以他们发现了一个强烈的关系，即那些退化为自闭症的儿童也是按时接种MMR[[zh:疫苗]]的。相对风险是按时接种MMR[[zh:疫苗]]的孩子要高出大约2.5倍，而不是等到三岁后再接种。所以这并不像非裔[[zh:美国]]男孩那么深刻，但它是一个非常，非常深刻的信号，他们却把它埋藏了。他们在2004年发表这篇论文时，并没有公开这一点。
