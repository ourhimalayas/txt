(Voir dire resumed; May 23, 2024)
THE COURT: Good morning. Would you make your
appearances, please.
MR. FINKEL: Good morning, your Honor. Ryan Finkel,
Juliana Murray, Micah Fergenson, and Justin Horton for the
government. We're joined at counsel table by a paralegal
specialist on staff, Michael Gartland.
MR. KAMARAJU: Good morning, your Honor. Sidhardha
Kamaraju, Sabrina Shroff, Scott Schirick, and Adam Barkan on
behalf of Mr. Guo, who is seated at counsel table.
THE COURT: Please be seated.
Are you ready to begin the peremptories?
MR. SCHIRICK: Your Honor, we had requested a quick
sidebar just to discuss process before we begin peremptories,
just generally on process questions.
In thinking through this last night and looking at the
numbers, the way that things are shaping up, it seems clear to
us, and I presume to the government, that we're going to have a
jury today——probably no later than tomorrow, but likely today.
But as it stands, we don't have a second 12 subpanel, we only
have the first 12 because we have a total of 21, if our count
is correct. So our suggestion, if it makes sense to everyone
else and to the Court, would be to go through the qualification
process for the folks who are sitting downstairs so that we can
have at least a second full subpanel of 12 to come behind the



current panel of 12, with the idea being that that way we at
least can see who's coming up next. Of course, based on the
way that yesterday went and the factors that we all know we're
facing in terms of picking a jury, we've got a holiday weekend,
we've got a long trial, the yield that we had yesterday was
pretty low, it was 21 out of a hundred, so roughly 20 percent.
And our concern would be, the later we wait in the day to
qualify the folks who are now sitting downstairs, the more
likely it is that yield is going to drop. So we don't want to
find ourselves in a position where we have fewer jurors in the
panel that's sitting downstairs qualified to be able to slide
in behind the current 12. So our suggestion would be, if it
makes sense to everyone, to go through the qualification
process for the folks who are downstairs before going through
the peremptory process for the first 12.
THE COURT: So the jurors that are downstairs are not
going to be ready immediately.
MR. SCHIRICK: Understood.
THE COURT: I don't expect them for another hour,
maybe longer, given how long they took yesterday. And we could
get these peremptories knocked out now and just go right into
the qualification process. And you're saying that you would
not like to do that.
MR. SCHIRICK: Yeah. I think our thought, your Honor,
was, given how low the yield was from yesterday, the sooner we



know we're going to get to that second 12——
THE COURT: Right. But what I'm saying is that we can
knock out the peremptories before the panel is even ready to
come up.
MR. SCHIRICK: I completely understand. I think the
thought, just to share with the Court, is really twofold. One
is, the later in the day that we wait to qualify the folks who
are sitting downstairs, whom we know we're going to need——
THE COURT: Right. What I'm saying is that we would
not essentially be waiting.
MR. SCHIRICK: Fair enough, your Honor.
THE COURT: Do you disagree with that?
MR. SCHIRICK: Well, I think——yeah, I think the sooner
we do that, the better is the first point; and the second point
is, just from a process perspective, for both the defense and
the government, being able to know, have some sense of who is
in the second 12 and a third 12 certainly informs the
peremptories that we would exercise beginning on the first 12.
THE COURT: I understand the second point. I disagree
with the first.
What is the prosecution's position?
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, your Honor.
On the first point, I think it's most efficient to
proceed as the Court instructed the parties to be ready to do
this morning.



On the second point, the government feels that it's
appropriate to go forward now, if that's what the Court would
like to do. If the Court wants to wait, we can, but we might
as well take advantage of this time. That's the government's
view.
THE COURT: I agree. So let's start with the
peremptories.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, just one just sort of
logistical question on the peremptories, just to make sure we
understand the pool correctly. For the first 12, it's
essentially Juror No. 1 through Juror No. 69; is that correct?
THE COURT: So according to my records, Juror No. 1
was dismissed.
MR. FINKEL: Sorry. Yes.
THE COURT: Let me read out the list of jurors that I
understand to be in the pool. Juror No. 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11,
12, 15, 34, 49, 58, 69, 70, 73, 77, 78, 79, 81, 83, 88, 90.
Okay.
MR. FINKEL: And so, your Honor, if I may, so the
first sort of available 12 that we're striking from would be
2——69 would be the last of the 12.
THE COURT: That is correct.
MR. FINKEL: All right. Thank you.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, the way that we're striking
at this point, it wouldn't allow Mr. Guo to properly anticipate



how to strike on these 12 because the Court's rules don't allow
us to work backward, so in exercising the 10, we don't have a
sense of what is to come in the next pool, the next 12 and the
12 after.
THE COURT: I understand your arguments, and I don't
agree with your premise, and the application is denied.
One moment, please.
All right. I just received a message from my law
clerks that Juror No. 2 had stated that it was going to be a
financial hardship for her to serve so I'd like to bring her
back in.
MR. SCHIRICK: Your Honor, we have one point of
clarification. Is now the right time or——while the juror is
walking in?
THE COURT: Go ahead.
MR. SCHIRICK: The question is with respect to the
next subset. Will we be asked to exercise on the following
eight or will we be qualifying an additional four so that we
have a subpanel of 12 before we exercise?
THE COURT: We need 12, and so it's just going to be
that first group of 12.
MR. SCHIRICK: Understood. Thank you.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Good morning. And welcome back.
JUROR: Thank you.



THE COURT: I understand there's something you'd like
to say.
JUROR: Yes. I'm sorry about this. My boss——or I
work for a university and I have a professor who is on——or my
boss has a professor who is on tenure——or, sorry, sabbatical,
and I'm on his project, and they need me until June 30th, so
she said it would be a financial hardship to let go of me for
seven weeks. And——
THE COURT: So where is it that you work?
JUROR: Columbia University.
THE COURT: And what's the nature of the work?
JUROR: I work with, like——like, bacteria and, like
yeast materials, and I do, like, genetic transformations.
THE COURT: You're in a lab.
JUROR: Yes, in a lab.
THE COURT: Okay. And so what would happen if you got
hit by a truck today?
JUROR: Well, his——his study would stall. I'm the
only one working with him on his project, and I——I do the
genetic transformations for him and I prepare the materials for
him and then he will do experiments. So it's like a teamwork
and——
THE COURT: And if you got sick and you understood
that you have to be out for seven weeks, he would just have to
wait for you; isn't that true?



JUROR: Yes, I guess.
THE COURT: And you would get paid during those weeks;
is that correct?
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: So it essentially amounts to an
inconvenience to the professor; is that right?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All right. You can step out.
JUROR: Okay. Can I also say one more thing. I am on
a medication and it kind of works as, like, a diuretic. Sorry.
But I have——I, like, need a lot of restroom breaks, so——
THE COURT: Well, how frequently would you say?
JUROR: Like once an hour. I had to ask your clerks
multiple times to use the bathroom. It's——yeah.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: And my concern would be, if we are in trial
for about three hours, I don't think I could do that without a
break.
THE COURT: All right. You can step out.
JUROR: Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing her?
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, we, of course, defer to the
Court, but with respect to the——she works for Columbia
University. There are other lab techs. It's a large entity.



I'm sure they could fill in whatever inconvenience it is, and
if it's truly something only she can do, she can do it after
3:00.
With respect to the issue, the medical issue, she
seemed to be fine yesterday, and, you know, having to go to the
bathroom every 60, 90 minutes, whatever it is, is kind of
normal. So we don't think this is a reason to excuse her for
cause. That's the government's view.
THE COURT: So your position is that I should just
give her those breaks.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, I think——the government
defers to the Court because you're, of course, running the
trial, and if it will be inconvenient to the trial, then we
defer to the Court on its judgment with respect to that issue.
And with respect to the first issue, we would object, because I
don't think it's really a hardship to her or to Columbia
University.
THE COURT: I agree with respect to No. 1, your point
No. 1. With respect to point No. 2, we did excuse a gentleman
yesterday who said he had a prostate condition and needed to go
to the bathroom frequently.
MR. FINKEL: That's true. That individual said he had
to go to the bathroom every 15 minutes.
The other thing, just——this particular juror didn't
mention that issue yesterday and mentioned that second issue



today only after the Court sort of greeted the first issue with
appropriate skepticism, and I guess what I'm saying, your
Honor, is, candidly, I'm not really sure that's a major issue.
So I think——I think she should stay on. If she survives, we'll
deal with her.
MR. KAMARAJU: So I think we're all on the same page
with respect to the first issue, but I do think the second
issue would be pretty disruptive to the Court's calendar. I
agree your Honor did dismiss somebody for a similar reason.
The juror did say that she had asked the clerks for a break
yesterday——several times, I think she said. And the fact is
that throughout the process, we have been crediting the things
prospective jurors have said. So I think she should be
excused.
THE COURT: I'm going to consult my clerks.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT: I'm told by my clerks that she requested a
bathroom break three times in the morning, and so I think that
that that would slow things down for us, and so I'm going to
excuse her.
We also have No. 7, who has asked to speak with me
privately. She states that there was something that she did
not say because she did not want to say it in front of the
attorneys. And so I will have a private conference. With the
reporter, of course.



MS. SHROFF: May we just approach, just counsel, for a
second?
THE COURT: Okay.
(At the sidebar)
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, it's about the interpreter.
THE COURT: So you're asking to raise an issue off the
record?
MS. SHROFF: Just for a minute.
(Discussion off the record)
THE COURT: So I understand that there's a complaint
concerning the interpreter, male interpreter who is the older
individual, that he is mistranslating, and the example that
counsel gave me was that for the word "hour," he said the word
"week," and so that, of course, is not acceptable, and I will
not have him continue as interpreter. I am going to have my
staff contact the interpreters office to let them know that,
and we need a third individual, or we'll have to simply go with
two. Certainly for right now, for this morning's purposes,
we're going to go with two.
MR. FERGENSON: Thank you, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you.
MR. FINKEL: For clarity of the record, we understand
defense counsel isn't raising any issues that defendant was
unable to understand what transpired in the courtroom or today,
that the interpreter was providing sufficient and adequate



assistance so that he could understand what was going on in
this case and that there was no objection with what happened
yesterday or today.
MS. SHROFF: The record is what the record is, your
Honor. I mean, there's nothing further we can add. The record
is clear.
THE COURT: Well, the question is whether or not we
need to start from scratch because you may raise an objection
concerning what happened yesterday.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, if we had an objection
yesterday, I promise you we would have raised it. So what I
meant to say is, since there's nothing in the record yesterday,
we're not going to go back and raise it, because we know it
would be incumbent on us to raise it. So I am aware, your
Honor, of course.
MR. FINKEL: And there's no objection, as I understand
it, from Ms. Shroff with continuing to use that interpreter
today. That's what she mentioned.
MS. SHROFF: That's not what we said, and that's not
what the Court said.
MR. FINKEL: Oh.
THE COURT: We're just going to go with the two that
are——
MR. FINKEL: Oh, I understand.
THE COURT: ——competent, and that individual will no



longer be interpreting.
MR. FINKEL: That's fine with the government.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can we just have a moment to confer
about the Juror No. 7 issue?
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT: Please have No. 7 come in.
(Juror present at sidebar; no attorneys present)
THE COURT: Good morning. Welcome back.
You are No. what?
JUROR: 7.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the issue?
JUROR: I'm so emotional. In——so in 2022——my husband
was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2022, and he was fine,
but on Monday we found out now that he has cancer again, so I
just want to know, like, we were trying to make arrangements on
what's our next plan, so I want to be there with him, like I
was there two years ago and I was supporting him in that area,
and me being in this case, it's too much for me. It's going to
be a problem for me.
THE COURT: So you know that we end every day at 2:45,
which will give you the opportunity to go to the doctor with
him for appointments that are in the late afternoon.



JUROR: Okay. I didn't know that. I thought you guys
ended at 5:00 every day. And I'm here with no cellphone, with
no way to, you know, be in——like, if there was a video chat or
something, I couldn't even, you know, be part of the——the
meeting, so there's no form of him communicating with me. I
thought that we was able to use our phones here. We cannot
even bring our telephones here either.
THE COURT: So you're saying that because you don't
have the phone, you feel that even being able to go to the
appointment is too distressing for you?
JUROR: It's overwhelming for me knowing that he's
going through this process again, and it's just overwhelming
for me. Like, I had the conversation with him yesterday. I
really didn't want to discuss that in front of everyone
yesterday. I felt very uncomfortable about it. But I said,
you know, let me speak to the judge and see what, you know,
what can we do here. I'm just sharing. That's all.
THE COURT: So what I'm trying to get at is whether,
knowing that you're leaving at 2:45 every day, is that a
comfortable way for you to go forward?
JUROR: Yeah. It's a comfortable way for me to go
forward. I thought I was going to leave out of here like
around——I got home at 6:30 yesterday, and, you know, so——
THE COURT: Okay. So then just keep in mind, I will
not have you stay beyond 2:45. Okay?



JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: All right. Thank you.
JUROR: Okay. Thank you.
(Discussion off the record)
THE COURT: So what I wanted to mention to you that I
didn't mention to you before is that when you have your break
from 11:30 to 12, we're going to provide a snack, and you can
use the cellphone at that time.
JUROR: Yeah, yeah, I did, which I did yesterday.
Yeah, I did——I went right away and used my cellphone. Yes.
Yes, if I have a problem, yes. Thank you.
THE COURT: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
(In open court)
THE COURT: No. 7 told me that her husband has
prostate cancer and that she didn't feel comfortable discussing
the subject matter with the attorneys yesterday but she wants
to accompany him on any medical appointments, and I pointed out
that we will be ending at 2:45 every day, I asked her if she
was comfortable going forward knowing that, she said yes, and
so I see no reason to excuse her.
All right, then. We are excusing No. 2, which means
that we are going to go through Juror No. 70.
All right. So I will hear first from the defense. Do
you have any peremptory challenges with respect to that first



group through No. 70?
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes, your Honor. Just for the record,
we'd obviously renew our for-cause objections from before to
jurors 11, 15——
THE COURT: I'm having difficulty hearing you. Would
you put the microphone near you.
MR. KAMARAJU: I apologize. Thank you, your Honor. I
said just for the record, we would renew our for-cause
challenges to jurors 7, 11, 15, and 12 from yesterday, but in
terms of the peremptories that we're exercising today, 4, 7——
THE COURT: One second.
So No. 4 is defense peremptory No. 1.
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: What's the next one?
MR. KAMARAJU: 5, your Honor.
THE COURT: No. 5. No. 5 is defense peremptory No. 2.
Go ahead.
MR. KAMARAJU: No. 7, your Honor.
THE COURT: No. 7 is defense peremptory No. 3. Go
ahead.
MR. KAMARAJU: No. 11, your Honor.
THE COURT: No. 11 is defense peremptory No. 4. Go
ahead.
MR. KAMARAJU: And our last one is No. 15, your Honor.
THE COURT: No. 15 is defense peremptory No. 5.



Now we go to the prosecution.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, the government strikes 49.
THE COURT: Okay. So No. 49 is the government's
peremptory No. 1.
MR. FINKEL: Could we just have one second, your
Honor.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. FINKEL: 69.
THE COURT: No. 69 is government peremptory No. 2.
MR. FINKEL: And No. 70, your Honor.
THE COURT: No. 70 is government peremptory No. 3.
And so you're saying that that is your last one?
MR. FINKEL: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay.
MR. FINKEL: For this one.
THE COURT: So that would make No. 10 Juror No. 1,
No. 34 Juror No. 2——is that incorrect?
MR. KAMARAJU: I think you may have skipped over 12.
THE COURT: No. 12? Did I skip No. 12? Oh, I'm
sorry. I did. So No. 12 is Juror No. 2; and then 34 is No. 3;
58, No. 4. And I think that's it. Are you in agreement?
MR. KAMARAJU: From the defense we are, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay. So are they preparing the panel?
THE LAW CLERK: Yes.



THE COURT: We have about a hundred coming up.
All right, then. So I'll let you know when the panel
is ready.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
(Recess)
THE COURT: You can be seated.
I was just informed that No. 58, who I believed to be
present, actually is not present and has stated that he or she
has a stomach flu and will be present tomorrow. I don't know
if that alters anyone's position.
MR. FINKEL: Not from the government.
MR. KAMARAJU: So just so we understand, so we would
not seat her on the jury and just bring up the next panel; is
that how that——
THE COURT: I don't think that that's what the
government is asking for. Is that what you're asking for?
MR. KAMARAJU: Well, I just know that if she has a
stomach flu, I know she hopes to be here tomorrow, but I don't
know we can count on her being here tomorrow.
THE COURT: That is a legitimate concern.
MR. KAMARAJU: So yes, we would ask that you not seat
her and let the parties proceed to the next panel with——I don't
know if that alters our strikes, but——
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, the government's view would
be that of course the Court can impanel the jury tomorrow



morning, and I would defer to the Court and the district staff
with respect to her viability——that's not the right word——for
her confidence in her belief that she could be here on Friday,
and if she feels she'll be up to it, I think we should take her
at her word; if she feels she'll still be sick and can't come
in, that's a different story.
MR. KAMARAJU: Then, your Honor, then we're stuck in a
position that you have one less alternate or juror than you
thought you had, instead of just addressing the issue now.
THE COURT: Yes. I don't think I can count on this
individual's claim.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, although——well, for one,
although——well, it's not ideal, obviously, if a juror doesn't
show up tomorrow, but that's why we have alternates. And of
course, look, if the Court feels that we should just sort of
take her off the jury and just move on to the next 12, the
government is not going to quibble with your Honor's
inclination, but if she does feel that she'll be in tomorrow, I
think we should accept that and move forward. That's the
government's view.
MR. KAMARAJU: So I'm assuming the government's
position is that we should move forward, from all of that. As
we've said, I don't think it would be ideal for the Court to
start off with one alternate down before the trial has even
started, so the safer course, from our position, is to simply



remove her to and proceed to the next panel.
THE COURT: I'm going to do that. And so that means
that we only have three jurors. So I'm going to dismiss her,
No. 58.
All right.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
(Recess)
THE COURT: I'm told that there's another juror who
wants to speak with me. It's the individual who was selected
as Juror No. 2, formerly Juror No. 12.
MR. KAMARAJU: I'm sorry, your Honor. It was the one
originally designated Juror No. 12?
THE COURT: The person who was yesterday known as
Juror No. 12.
I'm also told by the jury department that it is their
opinion that Juror No. 29 has cognitive difficulties, and so my
question is: Is there any objection to my excusing him?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: 29, your Honor?
THE COURT: That's the——
MR. FINKEL: Oh, is that one of the people who didn't
come back?
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, he did come back. He came
back in the afternoon. I think he was——
THE COURT: He did come back.



MS. SHROFF: He was escorted up by the jury clerk
because he was having difficulty, I believe, finding the floor.
MR. FINKEL: I was just clarifying whether he was
someone we considered this morning. I understand he was not.
No objection.
THE COURT: All right. So No. 29 is dismissed.
THE LAW CLERK: Counsel, your microphones tend to be
on so in the livestream they can hear you unless we mute all of
them, which I can do, so when we're on the record, obviously,
we want the microphones on, but during voir dire, we have
everything muted.
MR. FERGENSON: I think we're able to turn it off,
so——
THE LAW CLERK: This is being livestreamed into the
jury room as well as the overflow, so I just wanted you to be
aware of that.
MR. FERGENSON: Understood. Thank you.
THE COURT: We'll return when that juror arrives.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
(Recess)
(Juror present in the courtroom)
THE COURT: Good morning.
JUROR: Good morning.
THE COURT: What number are you?
JUROR: 12.



THE COURT: And what is it you wanted to tell me?
JUROR: So I have my——my parents are coming into town
in June. They haven't been here since 2015. And so I was
trying to plan something nice, and I made a reservation
June 18th through the 21st in Amagansett. And I checked
yesterday, it's nonrefundable, you know, a month before. Up to
a month before, it's refundable; after that, it's
nonrefundable. And I spent $4,185 on this trip that I would
have to——that I would lose, in addition to not, you know, being
able to, I guess, enjoy the time with my parents. But it
really is about the money and I guess the nonrefundability
about it.
THE COURT: When did you make those plans?
JUROR: In April.
THE COURT: And do you have proof of these
reservations?
JUROR: I do.
THE COURT: With you?
JUROR: Well, on my phone, which I don't have, but I'm
certainly willing to show you on my phone.
THE COURT: Well, I'm directing that you show me.
JUROR: Okay. Of course.
THE COURT: And I'm going to have you send an email to
the court email address, and my law clerks will give that to
you, and then I'll call you back into the courtroom.



JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: Why didn't you mention this yesterday?
JUROR: Because, again, getting to your——well, I
wanted to see if it was——if there was a way to cancel it,
but——so I wanted to check just in case, and so I didn't mention
it because maybe, you know, saying that you have a vacation
isn't, you know, a good enough reason. But then when I checked
and I realized that——quite frankly, I forgot how large of an
amount it was, and when I checked that it is nonrefundable,
that's why I brought it up today.
THE COURT: So was it just you and your parents going
to Amagansett or were there others involved?
JUROR: My wife.
THE COURT: All right. So you can retrieve your
cellphone and send that email, and then I'll call you back in.
Your cellphone is where?
JUROR: Downstairs.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So if it is the case that he made those
plans in April and whatever email comes through looks like it
is legitimate, what would be the parties' position?
MR. KAMARAJU: Well, I think it would be consistent
with what the Court has done with other prospective jurors who



have had preplanned travel to excuse him. I think that's what
we've been doing with all of the other jurors who had travel
planned before they were called for jury duty, who had already
paid for the accommodations and would suffer financial harm if
they didn't, so I think——yeah, for a personal reason, your
Honor. I'm sorry. Ms. Shroff is reminding me that in the
past, with the prospective jurors who had personal travel that
was preplanned, the Court has excused them, and so I think
No. 12 would be in that same boat.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, the government shares what I
believe to be the Court's frustration that this juror didn't
mention this obvious conflict yesterday. I think it would have
saved the parties' time. Being that we're here, if he has a
$4,000 vacation planned that he can't move, no objection.
THE COURT: All right. So when I see the
documentation, I'll let you know.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
(Recess)
THE COURT: So I have the reservation, which indicates
that it was made on April 16th of this year and that it's for
three nights on June 18th, 19th, and 20th, so if he were
required to serve, he would miss the vacation.
Any further comments?
MR. FERGENSON: No, your Honor. Thank you.
THE COURT: Okay. So I am going to excuse him.



If you'll have the juror brought back in, please.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: You may be seated.
Thank you for sending the email. I see that you would
have to miss your vacation if you were to serve as a juror, and
so I'm going to excuse you.
JUROR: Thank you, your Honor.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So that is going to mean that No. 34 is
now No. 2.
I'm told that the second panel is outside. I'm told
that No. 14 from yesterday is now here and so I'll put him at
the very end, seat him as the last person.
All right. If we can have the panel brought in.
(Jury venire present)
(Jury venire sworn)
THE LAW CLERK: Thank you.

THE COURT: Good morning.
THE JURORS: Good morning.
THE COURT: My name is Analisa Torres. I'm the judge
who will be handling this trial. We're here this morning to
select a jury in a criminal case, which is titled United States
v. Miles Guo.
Through this process, we will choose the 12 jurors and
six alternate jurors who will hear and decide the case.
Trial is expected to last about seven weeks, but it's
impossible to predict the exact length of the trial.
Today you'll be required to be here until 5 p.m. If
we do not finish selecting a jury today, you will be required



to be here from 9 a.m. sharp to 5 p.m. tomorrow.
After jury selection, our schedule will be as follows:
You'll be required to be in the courtroom from 9:30 a.m. to
2:45 p.m., with a break from 11:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. So once a
jury is selected, if you're on the jury, the schedule is,
you'll be here starting at 9:30 sharp, you'll leave at
2:45 p.m., and there will be a break between 11:30 a.m. and
12 p.m.
The jury selection process is intended to make sure
that we have a jury of citizens who will decide the issues in
this case fairly and impartially, and without any bias or
prejudice in favor of or against either side. In order to do
that, I'm going to ask certain questions about your personal
background, your family, some of your beliefs and attitudes
about certain matters, how you are employed, and so forth. You
should understand my questioning is not intended to pry into
your lives but to make sure that we select fair and impartial
jurors——that is, jurors who will be free from preconceived
notions or prejudice that might prevent them from returning a
fair and just verdict, based solely on the evidence or lack of
evidence.
If for any reason you are unable to serve as a fair
and impartial juror, it is your duty to inform me. In
responding to my questions, it is important that you not say in
open court anything about the parties in this case or about any



other matter that might tend to impair the open-mindedness and
fairness of the other jurors. If a question calls for a yes or
no answer, simply answer yes or no. If there are further
matters that you believe should be disclosed but that might
tend to influence the other jurors, you may ask to approach the
bench to discuss them.
If you are selected to serve, you will be provided
light refreshments in the morning and a light snack during the
lunch break each day.
As I said, this is a criminal case. The defendant,
Miles Guo, has been charged with committing 12 federal crimes
in a document called an indictment. The indictment itself is
not evidence. It simply contains the charges that the
government is required to prove to the satisfaction of the jury
beyond a reasonable doubt. I will instruct the jury on what
this burden of proof means after the evidence is presented.
The defendant has denied the charges and has pleaded
not guilty.
I have no knowledge of the facts of this case and
nothing that I say is evidence. I will, however, briefly
discuss the charges so that you'll understand the reason for
certain questions, and so that we can determine whether there
is anything about the charges that would make it impossible for
you to serve as a fair and impartial juror.
Of course, those of you selected to sit on the jury



will receive a detailed explanation of the charges at the
conclusion of the case.
Before I start asking questions, I will explain why
each of you has been assigned a number and will be called by
your number only. This case will be tried before a partially
anonymous jury. The names of the jurors and of all of you who
are seated here are not going to be announced publicly. I, the
court administrators, the defendant, defense counsel, the
prosecution, and my law clerks will know your names, but again,
that will not be shared with the public. Jurors who are
ultimately selected can share their names with each other, but
in open court, no juror will ever be referenced by their name.
This case has attracted media attention, and that is
likely to continue. The purpose of using a partially anonymous
jury in this trial is to protect all of you from any unwanted
attention and invasion of your privacy, and to ensure that
nothing transpires that might interfere with your impartial and
objective study of the evidence and the application of the law.
I am now going to tell you briefly about the charges
in this case.
The indictment consists of 12 charges, or counts. The
government alleges that the defendant operated four fraudulent
investment schemes as part of a criminal enterprise. The term
"criminal enterprise" is also referred to as a racketeering or
RICO enterprise.



Count One charges the defendant with conspiracy to
operate a criminal enterprise.
Counts Two, Three, and Four charge the defendant with
conspiracy to commit wire fraud, bank fraud, securities fraud,
and money laundering offenses.
Counts Five and Six charge the defendant with
securities fraud and wire fraud in connection with a private
stock offering for a media company known as GTV.
Counts Seven and Eight charge the defendant with wire
fraud and securities fraud in connection with loans made to a
group known as the Himalaya Farm Alliance.
Counts Nine and Ten charge the defendant with wire
fraud and securities fraud in connection with a lifestyle
membership company known as G Clubs.
Count Eleven charges the defendant with wire fraud in
connection with the Himalaya Exchange, which some have
described as a cryptocurrency ecosystem.
Finally, Count Twelve charges the defendant with
making a $100 million wire transfer using money derived from a
crime.
The defendant has pleaded not guilty and is presumed
innocent of these charges unless and until he is proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt under rules that I will describe as
we proceed. I briefly discuss the charges not for the purpose
of giving you any instruction but only so that you will have



them in mind as we go through jury selection.
I am now going to ask some questions of the entire
group. If you prefer not to give your answer in public, just
let me know, and the lawyers and I will hear you at the bench.
If you have a yes answer to any of these questions, please
raise your hand so that I and my staff can see who you are,
then I will either discuss your yes answer with you in open
court or ask you to come over to the sidebar and speak with me
and the attorneys in private. It is important that each of you
not discuss among yourselves any questions that I ask.
(Continued on next page)



THE COURT: After we have reviewed a number of general
questions together as a group, then I will ask each of you
concerning your own individual backgrounds.
During the questioning, you may be excused from
serving as a juror in this case. If you happen to be excused,
do not consider that a reflection on you personally. This is
all part of our system of justice, which is intended to provide
a fair and impartial jury for both sides. You will have done
your duty by your presence and your readiness to serve.
Do any of you have a problem with your hearing or
vision that would prevent you from serving as a juror?
JUROR: Yes, my vision has changed.
THE COURT: If you'll just wait one moment.
If you'll say your number.
JUROR: My number is 117. And my vision has changed.
And I don't have glasses that currently reflect what my vision
is. I can see up close with my glasses, but otherwise things
are blurry.
THE COURT: Can you see the court reporter, the
stenographer, who is there with the black jacket and a red
shirt?
JUROR: I can see her and she's blurry, but I can see
her.
THE COURT: Okay. Anything else?
JUROR: About my vision?



THE COURT: Vision or hearing?
JUROR: Oh, no, no. Nothing else.
THE COURT: Okay. Anyone else?
Are any of why you taking any medications or do you
have any health-related problems that would prevent you from
serving as a juror?
All right. You may step up.
Counsel.
(At sidebar)
THE COURT: With regard to No. 117, she says her
vision is blurry. Is there anyone who'd object to my excusing
her?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No objection.
THE COURT: Okay. So No. 117 is dismissed.
All right. So let's have the first individual come
forward.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: All right, then, sir. What is your
number?
JUROR: 103.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I've been told by my doctors this week I have
a possible heart condition and a battery of tests starting next
week. I have a family history of it. My dad just had a triple



bypass, so it's something where considering the length of this
trial, very concerned that I'd have to wait that long to do
these tests.
THE COURT: Are you saying that you had a triple
bypass?
JUROR: My father did.
THE COURT: Your father did?
JUROR: A family history, yes.
THE COURT: So if you're selected for the jury, we
stop every day at 2:45; and so you would be able to go to
appointments in the late afternoon. Would that be --
JUROR: I mean, I don't know what kind of delays -- I
know we've already had schedules for things first thing in the
morning next week. I don't know if they're able to reschedule
them. I know the length of this trial is TBD, so I don't know
how --
THE COURT: So I'll ask you to step back. Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing him?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. Would you tell me your number.
JUROR: 154.



THE COURT: And what's your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: So I had a stroke like three weeks ago. And I
have multiple appointments coming up in June because they don't
know the cause of the stroke.
THE COURT: All right. I'm sorry to hear that. And I
wish you a very swift recovery.
JUROR: Thank you.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Was that 154?
MS. MURRAY: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Any objection to her being excused?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 121.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXX.
THE COURT: XXXXXXX?
JUROR: XXXXX.
THE COURT: What is your problem?
JUROR: I can't sit or stand for long periods of time



because I have two herniated disks and a side joint dysfunction
due to a joint disorder.
THE COURT: All righty. Well, hope that you recover
from that. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 121?
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: All righty, sir. What is your number?
JUROR: 138.
THE COURT: 138. And what is your name?
JUROR: Heriberto Sanchez Soto.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: I had an injury in my shoulder. And I'm
undergoing physical therapy three times a week. And I usually
do it at 8 in the morning until 9 o'clock, so probably getting
here would be an issue by 9:30.
THE COURT: So we are stopping every day at 2:45.
Could you do it in the afternoon?
JUROR: I will see if I could change the schedule to
do it at 5 or -- they're open until -- I think 6 is their last
appointment they take.
THE COURT: Okay. And again, your number again?
JUROR: 138.



THE COURT: Okay. All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Okay. So we'll see what happens with him.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. Your number please?
JUROR: 165.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have epilepsy. And I take medication that
interferes with short-term memory and word retrieval.
THE COURT: Understood. All righty.
Thank you. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing No.
165?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 170.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: So I have PE, which is a pulmonary embolism;



and DVT, which is one in the upper body, one in the leg. I
take medication three times a day, which is an injection, a
blood thinner injection. And basically, being stationary for
long periods of time is not really helpful, causes clots, which
I do have a clot in my leg right now. But I still have to come
because I would be in the hospital as of right now.
THE COURT: All right, sir. I hope you get better.
You may step back.
JUROR: It's a lifetime thing, so thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 170?
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 171.
THE COURT: What is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: Endometriosis. I was recently diagnosed with
it last month. I have a biopsy for it next month.
THE COURT: So we stop every day at 2:45. Can you
schedule the biopsy for the afternoon?
JUROR: I can, but the -- as well as the -- sorry.
The pain that I have makes me debilitated for like two to three
days on end. So sometimes I'm not able to even get out of my



bed at times.
THE COURT: All right. Well, I'm hoping that you get
better.
JUROR: Thank you.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 171?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What is your number?
JUROR: 159.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: I'm prescribed a controlled substance by my
doctor for ADHD; and it needs to be taken at certain times
throughout the day. I'm worried that with the Court's
schedule, I wouldn't be able to maintain that schedule without
taking my medication throughout the day.
THE COURT: When is it that you need to take it?
JUROR: 8, 11 and 1 -- 8, 11, and 2.
THE COURT: So if I see to it that you're able to take
it at those times, would you be able to serve?
JUROR: Yeah.



THE COURT: All right, then. Your number again?
JUROR: 159.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
MS. SHROFF: Did you want to ask him if there are any
effects to the narcotics substance? I'm happy to leave it, I'm
just suggesting if you want.
THE COURT: All right. We can bring him back.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. This medication that you're taking,
would that have any effect on your ability to function in the
courtroom?
JUROR: I dehydrate a little bit, I need a little
water; but, I mean, it's just for my focus.
THE COURT: So with the medication you're able to
focus normally?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: All right.
So I see no reason to dismiss him.
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.



(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. Your number, please?
JUROR: 134.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: So I am in a clinical trial for multiple
myeloma. It's a form of blood cancer. So I'm in a clinical
trial. And so I have to draw blood samples periodically, I go
to get tested at MSK.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing No.
134?
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 111.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: Okay. I found that over the last couple of
years, I find that I have to go to the bathroom much more
frequently than I used to. But since I went to the bathroom



about an hour ago, and now I have to go again. And I'm
wondering if that's going to disrupt the proceedings.
THE COURT: So would you say that you need to go every
hour?
JUROR: It varies. It's not a set schedule. It's
just I have to go way more often than I used to.
THE COURT: I'm trying to determine if you were a
juror, when I would need to give a break for you to go, that's
what I'm thinking about.
JUROR: I can't give a definite answer.
THE COURT: So if I said I'm going to give you a break
once an hour?
JUROR: I suppose that would do.
THE COURT: You suppose?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: But you're not certain?
JUROR: Not certain.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing No.
111?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What's your number?



JUROR: 116.

THE COURT: And would you tell me your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I'm in mental health treatment about three
times a week for anxiety and an eating disorder. I have a
letter from my therapist. I didn't know if I should bring it
up right now or not, but --
THE COURT: Yes. Can I see the letter?
JUROR: Other hardship things, too, but I think
it's -- she's concerned and I'm concerned that jury duty is
going to put me over the edge.
THE COURT: All right. I have an email from Christine
Speare to Melissa Halligan -- I'm sorry, Melissa Halligan to
Christine Speare. And Dr. Halligan identifies herself as a
Ph.D. clinical psychologist at 353 Central Park West.
It says: This letter will serve to confirm that
Ms. Christine Speare is currently in mental health treatment
with Dr. Melissa Halligan to address an anxiety disorder.
Ms. Speare has indicated to me that serving on a jury at this
time would put her under significant stress, exacerbating her
anxiety disorder.
All right. Thank you for letting us know.
JUROR: Okay. Okay.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.



(Juror not present)
THE COURT: What number was that?
MS. SHROFF: 116.
THE COURT: All right.
No objection to my excusing her?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello?
JUROR: Hi.
THE COURT: You're No. 151?
JUROR: 151.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I take medication for high blood pressure and
anxiety.
THE COURT: Okay. So would either of those things
prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: So you would be able to sit through
courtroom testimony?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And nothing about being a juror is going
to make any of your health problems worse?



JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Okay, then. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So I see no reason to excuse No. 151.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What number are you?
JUROR: 150.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: Okay. It's more like a question.
I have some medical appointments. And I was just
wondering if that will interfere. My son has to do a procedure
next month; and I have to go with him to pick him up after the
procedure.
THE COURT: Do you know what time the procedure is?
JUROR: June 12th.
THE COURT: What time of day?
JUROR: That I don't know. He just told me the 12th.
THE COURT: Do you have an idea of when you would have
to pick him up?
JUROR: Whenever the procedure is over. But I don't
know -- I could find out.
THE COURT: Okay. Is that the only issue --
JUROR: And, okay, do I need to read anything during



the hearing? Because --
THE COURT: You'll have to read during the trial.
JUROR: I'm having issue with my eyes. I had cataract
surgery, and now I'm having aftereffects. So I went to the
doctor, the specialist. And on the 30th I got to go back for
him to see why I keep on having an infection -- not infection,
my eyes keep getting inflamed. So I have an appointment on the
30th.
THE COURT: So are you saying that at this time you
can't read?
JUROR: I can read some things, but I can't see
every -- everything. It's a little bit blurry.
THE COURT: Okay. All right. Thank you.
You may step back.
JUROR: Okay. Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is that 150?
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes.
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing her?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 155.
THE COURT: And your name, please?



JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.

THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I see a kidney specialist every month. And my
son, he's got cerebral palsy, goes to physical therapy twice a
week.
THE COURT: And you take him?
JUROR: Yes. I'm a single parent.
THE COURT: All right. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No objection to my excusing No. 155?
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
JUROR: Good morning. Juror 167.
THE COURT: 167. And what is your name, sir?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I take medication for my blood pressure,
diabetes and cholesterol. And I can't take them in the
mornings coming here because it makes me use the bathroom. I
take them at night.
Yesterday I was coming, I almost had an episode on the
stairs, climbing the stairs. It's just too hard for me. I
felt like I was having a heart attack climbing the stairs if I
don't take my medicine. I have to take them in the morning,



but I can't because I need to go to the bathroom. I don't know
what to do.
THE COURT: All righty. Thank you for letting me
know. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: 167.
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing him?
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 179.
THE COURT: And what is the issue?
I'm sorry, before you tell me that, what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: I'm sorry. Would you tell me your number
once more?
JUROR: 179.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: Two things:
I have chronic debilitating migraines, awful; on the
floor foaming at the mouth. They usually have about a
six-to-15-day spread in between the two of them. I've been
tracking it with Bons Secours Neurology. And I'm worried that



one is going to happen and it's going to be a problem.
Two, I'm currently working third shift at my job and
being awake is proving very difficult.
THE COURT: Thank you for letting me know.
I hope your condition improves.
JUROR: Me, too.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 179?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MR. BARKAN: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 196.
THE COURT: Okay. And what's the problem?
JUROR: I have hypertension. So I'm taking five
milligrams of Amlodipine for hypertension.
THE COURT: Okay. That is a standard medication.
Would this condition that you have interfere with your
ability to sit as a juror in this case?
JUROR: I don't think so.
THE COURT: All righty.
So is that all you wanted to tell me?
JUROR: Yes, that's all. That's all I'm taking.
THE COURT: Tell me your name.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.



THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I see no reason to excuse her.
MR. KAMARAJU: Agreed, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: Agree.
THE COURT: I have to tell you that in my 13 years as
a state judge, I never saw this volume of ill people.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, what is your number?
JUROR: 200.
THE COURT: And your name, sir?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: Well, I'm going through vascular tests,
testing right now for my diabetes, and mobility issue. Taking
the train, going up and down the stairs, is a problem for me.
THE COURT: So you feel it is physically difficult for
you to make it to court?
JUROR: Right now, yeah. Well, when I go to work, I
drive there; but to take the subway to get here and going up
and down the stairs is difficult for me.
THE COURT: Okay. And you said that you were number?
JUROR: 200.
THE COURT: Okay. All right. So you can step back.



(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 200?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello there. What number are you?
JUROR: 203.
THE COURT: And your name, please?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have M.S., and I've been symptomatic as of
late. So I'm here because I actually have appointments next
week with my neurologist to talk through it. So I don't
know -- I don't know if this was the right line for me to get
on, but the point is is that I've been symptomatic and I have
upcoming appointments to figure out what we're going to do
about it.
THE COURT: So when you say that you've been
symptomatic, are those symptoms that would interfere with you
serving as a juror?
JUROR: I think so. I have dizziness and I also have
a little bit of brain fog. So it's been high end as of late.
THE COURT: All righty. You said that you are 203?
JUROR: I am.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.



(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 203?
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Is that it?
MR. KAMARAJU: Yup.
Maybe we'll get to the weddings next.
MS. SHROFF: She's young.
THE COURT: All righty. Let's keep going.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Do any of you have trouble understanding
or reading English?
All right. If you'll step up, sir.
(At sidebar)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello, sir. What is your number?
JUROR: 139.
THE COURT: 139.
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: My English is not enough to understand what
you saying.
THE COURT: Okay. What is your name, sir?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what do you do for a living?



JUROR: Just a worker.
THE COURT: What kind of work do you do?
JUROR: Warehouse.
THE COURT: Okay. And what do you do at the
warehouse?
JUROR: Just stock, stock setup.
THE COURT: You do stock.
Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing No.
139?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: No.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. Would you tell me your number,
please.
JUROR: 201.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: The problem is that, first of all, I can read,
but to understand, I don't understand everything, and especial
the words what the people use in court.
THE COURT: Did you understand everything that I said?
JUROR: Yes.



THE COURT: And what do you do for a living?
JUROR: I'm a computer programmer.
THE COURT: And where do you work?
JUROR: I work for Department of Education.
THE COURT: The city or --
JUROR: City.
THE COURT: And what is your educational background?
JUROR: I'm a musician.
THE COURT: All right. You're a musician.
So do you have a college degree?
JUROR: I do have a college degree in Russia.
THE COURT: In Russia. Okay.
What is your instrument?
JUROR: Violin.
THE COURT: That's wonderful.
So you're saying that you would feel uncomfortable in
the courtroom, is that what you're telling me?
JUROR: I don't know if I feel comfortable or
uncomfortable. But if I don't understand something which is
really important, I cannot be a juror on the case like this
because this is important case. That's what I feel.
THE COURT: But you've told me that you have
understood everything that I said.
JUROR: Yes. No, now. Before, not everything.
THE COURT: Not everything before?



JUROR: Not everything.
THE COURT: Okay. All right, then.
You can step back. Thank you.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing No.
201?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
(In open court)
THE COURT: If a witness testified in a language that
you know and an interpreter translates the testimony, would any
of you not be able to rely exclusively on the interpreter's
translation of the testimony?
The trial in this case is estimated to last a total of
about seven weeks, that is, until approximately July 12th. We
will not be in session on federal holidays, nor will court be
in session on the following dates:
Monday, May 27th; Wednesday, June 19th; Friday, June
28th; Monday, July 1st; Thursday, July 4th; and Friday, July
5th.
Keeping in mind your civic duty to serve as a juror,
is there anything about the length of the trial that would make
it an extreme hardship for you to serve as a juror?
(At sidebar)



(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello, sir. Your number?
JUROR: Juror 101.
THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have to be in California for work the 12th
through the 15th of June. And then besides that, my son is a
ninja athlete, and he's got a world ninja competition in
Greensboro, North Carolina. We've already booked hotels and
everything. And that's June -- starts, like, June 20th and can
go through the 25th, depending on how he has performed.
THE COURT: All righty. So you may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing 101?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello.
JUROR: 103.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: I am a project manager for an investment bank,
and I have a few different deadlines in the next few weeks,
including some work for the SEC, AML, anti-motion in limine --
THE COURT: You may step back.



(Juror not present)
THE COURT: He's already been excused.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, what is your number?
JUROR: 111.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What is your number?
JUROR: 109.
THE COURT: What is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: I'm a primary caretaker of a two-year-old.
Just numerous doctors' appointments, things like that.
THE COURT: There's no one who can fill in for you?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing her?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello again. What is your number?



JUROR: 116.

THE COURT: 116. All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 112.
THE COURT: What is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: I have two children; one is 15, the other one
is 11. The 15 depends on me a lot. He has behavior issues.
So I have to be, you know, catering to him and my 11-year-old
daughter. And, you know, it's really difficult.
THE COURT: When you say behavior problems, does he
have a diagnosis?
JUROR: Yes, he does. He has ADD and he has conduct
disorder.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 112?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, what is your number?



JUROR: 114. Adelso Tavares.
THE COURT: What's the issue?
JUROR: I recently bought a house. And I also have a
child going to university. And I also help my sister with her
rent, so she's having financial issues. So I have a lot of
pressure on my back to complete my mortgage and help out family
members.
THE COURT: Are you saying that serving as a juror
would be a financial hardship?
JUROR: I'm the main breadwinner of the house.
THE COURT: Are you saying that you would not be paid
if you're on a jury?
JUROR: No. So my way of being paid is not enough to
be able to cover any of my expenses for the house or helping
out my family members.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 114?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 118.
THE COURT: And your name, please?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.



THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: It would be a financial hardship for me. I am
an account executive at a drug company. They don't pay for any
jury duty. And I am expecting a baby 1/18, so six months. So
it's a hardship. I won't be able to recoup the money because
of the length of the trial. And I'm the sole financial person
in my household.
THE COURT: All right, then. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
Any objection to my excusing No. 118?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 123.
THE COURT: Your name?
JUROR: XXXX.
THE COURT: Full name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: So a couple things.
I have a physical therapy practice on the Upper East
Side. If I leave for that kind of period of time, I have
patients that have already started plans of care. It sets me
up to basically be sued for patient abandonment. Because my



other therapist who works with me already has a full schedule.
I can't transfer anybody over. Like last night and tonight,
I'm leaving court to go treat from 5 to 8 p.m. to try and make
sure that the people get in in the short term. Big picture, if
you take that kind of revenue away from my business for the
next seven weeks, you could legitimately make me go bankrupt.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Juror not present)
Any objection to my excusing No. 123?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. Who's next?
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 122.
THE COURT: And your name, please?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: I have a three-year-old in preschool, and I
have a six-year-old in kindergarten, and I come from
Westchester. I drop my son off at school at 8:40, my daughter
off at 9. I'm the one that gets them ready for school in the
morning and drop them off.
In order to be here on time for six weeks, I would
have to find someone to be able to get them ready and drop them
off, which I'm not able to do so.



THE COURT: All righty. You said you were 122?
JUROR: Yes, ma'am.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 122?
MS. SHROFF: No.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 142 -- hold on. 124.
THE COURT: 124. And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I didn't have any -- I didn't really hear what
you said.
THE COURT: Do you have problems with your hearing?
JUROR: No, the concentrating.
THE COURT: So are you saying that you didn't
understand what I said?
JUROR: It was I didn't hear the whole thing you said.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing 124?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.



MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 121.
THE COURT: And did you say 121?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Oh, yes. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
JUROR: 120.
THE COURT: And your name, please?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: Oh, your Honor, I'm a nurse at the Memorial
Sloan Kettering; and I do direct patient care. It would be a
burden for me and my coworkers if I would be out for the next
seven weeks.
THE COURT: Are there other nurses at Memorial Sloan
Kettering?
JUROR: Yes, but my team work on short staff as it is.
So seven weeks might be too much.
THE COURT: And what happens if you get hit by a truck
today?
JUROR: Oh, well, they can handle it.
THE COURT: They'll be able to handle it?



JUROR: Yes. I hope not -- I won't be --
THE COURT: Of course. I certainly hope not.
And so you will be paid by MSK while you're on jury
duty; is that right?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Okay. No reason to excuse her.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 119.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: Problem is that my employer only pays me for
five weeks of jury duty. And my bills are significantly higher
than what the court can pay. So I am stressed that I may not
be paid for six or seven weeks.
THE COURT: So you're saying it would be a financial
hardship?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No objection to my excusing No. 119?
MS. SHROFF: No.



MS. MURRAY: No.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, what is your number?
JUROR: 102.
THE COURT: And tell me your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: Okay. And what is the problem?
JUROR: Tomorrow I have doctor appointment, and then
I'm Uber driver. If I am not working, I have no money. I have
three kids in college.
THE COURT: And so this would be a financial hardship?
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 102?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, your number, please?
125. Okay. And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: Okay. And what is the problem?
JUROR: My wife is a CNA and often gets called in to
do afternoon shifts, as well as evening shifts. And it even




happened yesterday. So there was a time at which my child, who
is a minor, had to be home alone. And for that -- that
frequently happens at her job. And she is called to go to an
elder care facility and cover.
And the thought of six or seven weeks where my son's
going to be alone at home is very concerning. And sometimes
when he has been at home some bad things have happened. So
lifting weights, he broke the glass in the wall unit. He tried
cooking and burned the section on the --
THE COURT: I understand your concern, sir.
You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 125?
MS. SHROFF: No.
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, I was just curious how old
his child is. He said his child is a minor. And also whether
that potential juror has a job, is employed during the day,
such that it would be consistent with our schedule.
THE COURT: Bring back the other person.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: So you mentioned that your son was lifting
weights. And you also said that he's a minor. How old is he?
JUROR: He's 17 -- 16. He just turned 16.
THE COURT: And at the age of 16, typically teenagers
are able to stay at home by themselves. So why is it that



you're concerned?
JUROR: He tends to get in a lot of trouble.
THE COURT: Like what?
JUROR: Like breaking stuff around the house.
THE COURT: Does he have a diagnosis?
JUROR: No, but he -- you know, he thinks like he's 21
and he could do things that grown people can do.
THE COURT: So you're saying that he's misbehaving?
JUROR: Well, at times. But he's still -- he's 16,
he's still a minor.
THE COURT: And what do you do for a living?
JUROR: I'm director of human resources.
THE COURT: Where?
JUROR: At the Mosholu Montefiore Community Center.
We're located in the Bronx. We serve 35,000 people in the
Bronx and Upper Manhattan every year, ranging from one year old
to 101 years of old. I am responsible for approximately 1,000
staff, 225 are full-time. I have one assistant.
THE COURT: And in such a senior position, you'll be
paid if you're serving as a juror, right?
JUROR: Oh, yes.
THE COURT: Okay. If you'll step back, please.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Okay. I agree. I don't believe that he
should be excused.



MR. KAMARAJU: That's fine, your Honor. I just think
you may run into a situation where this comes up later.
THE COURT: No. I mean, he looks like a person who is
disinclined to serve. And I appreciate your bringing up the
age issue. We'll have to see.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: What number are you?
JUROR: 126.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXX.
THE COURT: Your last name?
JUROR: XXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have a close family member who is getting
married on June 26. And I'm the maid of honor, so I would like
to be part of the day.
I also have -- my grandmother is coming from overseas,
who is 96. And she asked me if I could take some time off to
spend with her since she's of old age.
THE COURT: So what day does the 26th fall on?
JUROR: Wednesday.
THE COURT: And where is the wedding taking place?
JUROR: Connecticut.
THE COURT: And what time of day?
JUROR: I think it's around 4 or 5. I'm not sure.



THE COURT: So we stop at 2:45.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: You can get to Connecticut in time for a 5
o'clock wedding.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: And your grandmother, there are other
members of your household that she can be with?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: See no reason to excuse her.
MS. SHROFF: I think she's scared of you, to be
honest, your Honor.
THE COURT: That's a good thing.
MS. SHROFF: I don't know. I think grandmothers and
being a maid of honor, to have to schlep there at 3:45, I'd let
her go. But I leave it up to you.
THE COURT: Do you agree she should be excused?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor. We think she should
remain on the panel.
THE COURT: Okay. Let's go.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. Your number, sir?
JUROR: 127.
THE COURT: And your name?



JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.

THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I have travel plans either the 7th or the 8th,
14th or 15th, I forgot which weekend.
But also, I'm an attorney. I had two motions on for
this week that I kicked out once already to late June. Judge
is only giving me two adjournments.
THE COURT: Oh, we can take care of that.
JUROR: I know. I'm just telling you.
And then I have something on the trial calendar in
Nassau in July, which I'm not really worried about that. But
it's the two motions I'm worried about.
THE COURT: Oh, okay. So let's put that aside.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: These travel plans, you're using a plane
for the travel plans?
JUROR: I am.
THE COURT: Okay. And you've made those reservations,
you paid for it or no?
JUROR: Yeah. It's complicated.
THE COURT: I might ask you for those for proof of
that.
JUROR: Private. Private. Private.
THE COURT: Private plane?
JUROR: Private, yes.



THE COURT: Well, is it your private plane?
JUROR: No, it's not.
THE COURT: Okay. But you have a definite invitation
to be on someone else's private plane?
JUROR: Yes. I'm not sure it's the 7th/8th,
14th/15th, one of those two weekends. I forget off the top of
my head.
THE COURT: And so when would you be gone, the Friday?
JUROR: Thursday/Friday, one of those two weeks.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
JUROR: Okay. Thank you. Sorry for the confusion,
but I just forgot which weekend off the top of my head.
Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So the 7th and the 8th, I can't
remember --
MR. FINKEL: Is he saying June or July?
MR. KAMARAJU: I understood him to say June.
MR. FINKEL: He said June.
MR. FERGENSON: That's what I understood.
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 126?
MS. SHROFF: 27.
THE COURT: 127, I'm sorry.
MS. SHROFF: That's okay.
MR. KAMARAJU: I'd just like to know more about the



private plane.
MS. SHROFF: No objection, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No objection.
THE COURT: All right. 127 is gone.
Next.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What number are you?
JUROR: 129.
THE COURT: 129. And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: I'm a sole proprietor of my business. I'm an
art dealer. I'm participating in an art fair beginning of
July. We prepare for artists to come in. I'm it for my
business. So to be not there for seven weeks, that puts me out
of business.
THE COURT: You're saying it would be a financial
hardship?
JUROR: Oh, yeah.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step -- go ahead.
JUROR: I already laid out money for these art fairs.
THE COURT: Understood. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 121?



MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 130.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have flights booked and hotels for about
eight, nine days end of June. And my children are out of
school starting second week of June and I don't have care. I
don't have camp set up. I am -- I have a part-time baby-sitter
that will be caring for them while I'm doing my part-time job.
And she is -- she has some significant health issues. This
will be her last summer with us. And so I took on the primary
role as the caregiver during their vacation.
THE COURT: You said that your number is 130?
JUROR: That's right.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 130?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, your number?



JUROR: 131 your Honor.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: I've been a Ph.D. student for seven years.
I'm defending my dissertation on June 6th. If I cannot defend
on that day, then since academics are always gone over the
summer, I won't be able to defend it until December, and I will
lose my post-doctoral fellowship.
THE COURT: And what is your subject matter?
JUROR: Political science.
THE COURT: Where are you studying?
JUROR: Columbia University.
THE COURT: All right. Well, good luck.
JUROR: Thank you.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No objection to my excusing No. 131?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Your number, please?
JUROR: 132.
THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.



THE COURT: And your problem?
JUROR: I plan to be out of the country next month.
THE COURT: Where are you going?
JUROR: Japan.
THE COURT: And you have your tickets?
JUROR: No, not yet.
THE COURT: So can't you move --
JUROR: I have family there. My grandparents are
moving into a nursing home, so I'm going to help. But I
haven't bought my tickets yet.
THE COURT: So is their move a fixed date?
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 132?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: I like to see these young people helping
their grandparents.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 133.
THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.



THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: So it's kind of twofold.
One is my husband travels during the workweek weekly,
and I become the primary caregiver for my children. So I
wouldn't probably be able to get here on time those days and
would have to leave before the day is over to retrieve them
from school.
The other thing is I am employed, so also during the
hours when they are in school, and I work. I could not miss
seven weeks of my job.
THE COURT: Is that because it would be a financial
hardship?
JUROR: It would be a financial hardship, it would be
a professional hardship. It would be multi-level.
THE COURT: And how old are your children?
JUROR: One is nine, one is six.
THE COURT: And you're 133?
JUROR: 133.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing her?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: No.
(Juror present)



THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 134.
THE COURT: 134. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What is your number?
JUROR: 135.
THE COURT: Your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: It's not about the time period of the case,
but if it goes over, I have a wedding in July.
THE COURT: What is the date of the wedding?
JUROR: The 23rd.
THE COURT: Okay. So I am very confident that the
trial will be over well before July 23rd.
JUROR: Okay. And sometimes they go longer, so I just
wanted to be sure.
THE COURT: Yeah. No, no, this one is not going to go
that long. Otherwise?
JUROR: Then I'm fine.
THE COURT: Okay, great. Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No reason to dismiss No. 135.
(Juror present)



THE COURT: Hello there. What is your number?
JUROR: 136.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I've been a fraud investigator for 30 years,
and I think I would strongly lean towards the prosecution. I
don't think I could be fair.
THE COURT: What sort of frauds do you investigate?
JUROR: Welfare fraud. But I work with the FBI and
other agencies on all kinds of fraud. I'm very familiar with
wire fraud and things of that nature. Plus I have a court
hearing June 12th on a case that I worked on which I'm not
supposed to miss.
THE COURT: Are you saying that you're a witness in
that hearing?
JUROR: I'm one -- I'm the supervisor of one of the
investigators. I have to testify.
THE COURT: All right. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 136?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. Sir, what is your number?



JUROR: 138.

THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: I'm the executive director of a nonprofit, a
small organization. We're short-staffed. I do all the
financials, I do all the reporting.
The reason why I do my physical therapy in the
morning, so that I could have the day off to be able to report
to work. Seven weeks is just too much.
THE COURT: Are you saying it would be a financial
hardship?
JUROR: It would be a financial hardship for the
organization, not for me. Because there would be no one there
with the authority to make certain decisions, approve budgets,
and the like.
THE COURT: So if you got hit by a truck right now,
what would happen? What would they do?
JUROR: They would not have an executive director.
They would probably collapse.
THE COURT: You don't feel that they could find
somebody to fill your role?
JUROR: Well, the board will hire someone temporarily
to fill the role, but I'm the executive director now.
THE COURT: Right. I understand that you're a vital
person in this not-for-profit.
What is the name of the not-for-profit?



JUROR: Hispanic Aids Forum.
THE COURT: Hispanic Aids Forum.
So someone eventually would fill in --
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: -- if you were gone?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And it would not cause a calamity to have
a period of time that you were absent; in other words, you do
go on vacation, don't you?
JUROR: I haven't in three years. Working six days a
week.
THE COURT: I'm trying to assess the exact consequence
of your absence.
JUROR: Well, I am the executive director. I
understand the operations. There's no one else that has the
authority or the skills to handle all the pieces that I handle.
Yes, the board could bring someone else in on a
temporary basis. But that person doesn't know the operations.
So it would still be a hardship on the organization.
THE COURT: So if you were to be impaired in some way
today or you decide to retire today or resign, the organization
would be in the same position correct?
JUROR: I suppose so, yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: So someone could fill in for you?
JUROR: Well, I suppose someone will fill in. What



job that person would do, I don't know.
THE COURT: Right. Well, maybe not as good a job as
you, but somebody else would have to take over, right?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Okay. I'm not going to excuse No. 138.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What number are you?
JUROR: 139.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there.
JUROR: Juror 140.
THE COURT: Yes. And what is your name, sir?
JUROR: My name?
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: Situation is I'm self-employed. I perform
real estate closing services for bank attorneys, title
insurance companies on a per diem basis. If I don't work for
seven weeks, that's a huge loss of income. Plus, during that



period, my clients would develop relationships with other
closers; and at the end of that time period, I would need to
reestablish work connections.
THE COURT: So you're saying it would be a financial
hardship?
JUROR: That is correct.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So no objection to my dismissing No. 140?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there.
JUROR: My reasoning --
THE COURT: One second. You're No. 142?
JUROR: That's correct.
THE COURT: And your name, your full name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: Would you step a little closer.
And what is the problem?
JUROR: So I have two jobs right now. I work 9 to 5
at a retail brick-and-mortar location; I also have a
videography business as well. When business is a little bit
slow, I take that time and do video client work. Right now, 9



to 5, we're a little bit short-staffed, so one manager is out,
that doesn't really affect the business. Have to make people
work seven days when maybe they are not supposed to. Again,
that's just my reasoning. So two jobs, 9 to 5 at the
brick-and-mortar location. I also have a video business that I
do on the side as well.
THE COURT: So the trial would not affect the video
business; correct?
JUROR: Yeah, that I could do on the weekend, kind of
kill two birds with one stone while I'm at the job.
It's the 9 to 5 --
THE COURT: Are you saying that you do the video job
while you're at the 9 to 5?
JUROR: Yeah, yeah. The business is cool with that.
If it's down, no customers coming in, just in the office
killing two birds with one stone.
THE COURT: So if you're here during the day between 9
and 2:45, then you would not be able to do your video business;
is that right?
JUROR: I could do the video business any time. It's
the 9 to 5 that's really the issue, just because we're
short-staffed. I'm just explaining what I do during my 9 to 5.
THE COURT: So what happens if you get hit by a truck
today, what happens at the 9 to 5?
JUROR: I lose my life. I get replaced probably like



that.
THE COURT: And what happens at that business that
you're working at 9 to 5?
JUROR: They either close down a little bit earlier or
stretch out the employees that we have right now.
THE COURT: So what are your tasks at that business?
JUROR: So I take in the shipment from the -- so I
work at a travel -- it's like a luggage store. I take in the
shipment. Usually me and another guy that takes it in.
THE COURT: So you're receiving boxes?
JUROR: Yeah, yeah.
THE COURT: You think someone else could do that in
your place?
JUROR: Yeah. Kind of have to work seven days.
THE COURT: All right. Or they could hire someone
else?
JUROR: Yeah, sure. That works as well.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: Just takes some training, but, yeah.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I am not going to dismiss No. 141.
MS. SHROFF: 42.
THE COURT: 142, sorry.



(Juror present)
THE COURT: What is your number, sir?
JUROR: Sorry. My number is 143.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And your problem?
JUROR: I have a two-week trip planned to Japan
starting June 28th.
THE COURT: Is that something of a pleasure trip?
JUROR: Yeah, it's with my whole family, yes.
THE COURT: And you've bought your tickets?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All right. Bon voyage.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So No. 143 is dismissed.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number, please?
JUROR: 146.
THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I am an executive assistant to a CEO of a
public company. And so I'm just worried -- I'm sure other
people have other circumstances, but seven weeks is quite a



long time for me.
THE COURT: This is a big corporation?
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: And so you'll be paid during your jury
service; isn't that right?
JUROR: That's correct. In fact, like, during my
lunch I was working as well yesterday.
THE COURT: And so what are your duties?
JUROR: Sorry?
THE COURT: What are your duties?
JUROR: Oh, well, my CEO travels quite a bit; in fact,
right now he's in Europe. So for my teams on site, I support
them, our HR team, our legal team. Pretty much have tentacles
everywhere.
THE COURT: What company is that?
JUROR: ITT.
THE COURT: And they have other employees at that
company; isn't that correct?
JUROR: That's correct.
THE COURT: Someone could fill in for you; isn't that
right?
JUROR: Yes and no. Like, for instance, yesterday I
had to send out this last-minute email I had to do during my
lunch, sit there and scramble for lunch and find WiFi, because
I wasn't aware about the technology issue and not having



technology here. Anyway --
THE COURT: So if you get hit by a truck today, is ITT
going to be able to find someone to serve that CEO?
JUROR: Absolutely. I'm always replaceable.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I'm not going to excuse her.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 148.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have three.
First is that it would be a financial hardship for me,
as I'm a consultant and I'm a gig worker.
THE COURT: Gig worker. All right, ma'am.
You can step back.
JUROR: I had a couple of other points.
THE COURT: That's all right. You say it's a
financial hardship, you may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No. 148?
MS. MURRAY: No objection.



THE COURT: No objection? She is excused.
The defense does not object; correct?
MR. KAMARAJU: No objection.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: What is your number?
JUROR: 149.
THE COURT: Your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: I am an orthopedic surgeon in the south Bronx.
And I have a schedule that's booked out four months in advance,
including surgeries. And there's no way I could dedicate seven
weeks.
THE COURT: What hospital are you affiliated with?
JUROR: I'm at Bronx Care.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 149?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. You are No. 150?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.



(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there.
JUROR: Hi.
THE COURT: What is your number?
JUROR: 151.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: So I have limited childcare from now until the
end of the school year. I have a ten-year-old that both myself
and my husband, we work far from home. So if I am away for
longer than the school year, then I won't have any childcare
for her. And also I'm a special ed. teacher, and it's the end
of the school year, so we have end-of-the-year things to do.
So that would create a problem for me for work.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
Any objection to excusing No. 151?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello.
JUROR: Hi.
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 152.



THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: Last name?
JUROR: XXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: So we're coming to the end of the school year.
I'm a teacher. But childcare. And I also have an
eight-year-old, severely autistic daughter. So without being
able to take her to therapies after school, because my husband,
he's a firefighter, so his schedule is not as consistent as
mine.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 152?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 153.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: So I have an issue. So next week I'm supposed
to travel to California for work for a convention that I can't



reschedule. And this has been booked since February. So I
don't -- you know, I received a summons too late to send it in
for a postponement. So I didn't realize it was going to be
such a long process. So I'm not sure what to do.
THE COURT: What do you do for a living?
JUROR: I'm a marketing consultant.
THE COURT: And do you work for a corporation?
JUROR: No, I'm an independent contractor. So I
consult. So right now I'm working with IMG, and then doing
installation out in California for Monsterpalooza convention.
THE COURT: And what if you're not able to go to the
convention?
JUROR: I'm part of the installation crew. So there's
a team that works under me that I'm overseeing in terms of
installation and execution of the experience.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing her?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 156.



THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: So I work three jobs. And if I were to be on
this for seven weeks, I would miss one exclusively because it's
just the summer. So I would lose over 20 percent of my income
for the year.
THE COURT: And that would be a financial hardship?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 156?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 157.
THE COURT: And would you tell me your name and step
closer.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: I'm a full-time student currently, and I also
work evening shifts. So I wouldn't have mind about the
seven-week period. My term ends in July, I have a lot of exams



and things going on. So this being seven weeks and then I work
evenings a lot.
THE COURT: And what are you studying.
JUROR: Data analytics.
THE COURT: Good luck to you. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 157?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
JUROR: 158.
THE COURT: What is your name, sir?
JUROR: XXXXX.
THE COURT: What is your last name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: My wife and I have been planning a trip
starting June 27th for which we pre-booked the whole trip for
nonrefundable expenses of over $11,000.
THE COURT: Where are you going?
JUROR: Greece.
THE COURT: Bon voyage.
JUROR: Thank you.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Juror not present)



THE COURT: No objection to my excusing No. 158?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: I'd like to go with him.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello again.
JUROR: 159.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: I have a flight booked to Chicago on June
18th, returning June 25th. My father-in-law has leukemia, so
we're getting affairs in order. And my wife and I are going to
be in Chicago at that time.
THE COURT: Are you saying he's terminal?
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: I'm sorry to hear that.
All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Okay. Thank you. Do I --
THE COURT: You stay here. You just step back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 159?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What number are you?



JUROR: 160.

THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is your problem?
JUROR: I am a single mom. I'm a widow. So I'm the
only caregiver, sole caregiver of my child, who is 12. So
making -- so childcare for a couple of days is not a big deal.
But seven weeks will be almost impossible; commuting from
Rockland County will be almost impossible for seven weeks.
Plus, I work in this field, I know seven weeks might
even be a little longer, depending on -- plus I have a prepaid
vacation over July 4th, we leave on the 2nd and come back on
the 5th -- on the 5th, 6th, 7th. So I can't get that
rescheduled. It's prepaid.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you. I'm so sorry.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 160?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: What is your number?
JUROR: 162.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: My name is XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.



THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: Not sure if this qualifies as extreme
hardship, but I have an 87-year-old mother. She lives alone in
Queens. I am her sole means of care. She has another child
who lives in New Hampshire, largely disregards her.
She has an array of health issues. In the last two
years I receive phone calls all the time. I have to usually
rush out to Queens.
I live in Manhattan. I'm an attorney downtown, but I
have a very flexible work arrangement. I'm able to field calls
from her at all hours to help her and assist.
A seven-plus-week trial where I don't have the ability
to have a phone at my disposal during the day will be
problematic in terms of my being able to help her when I need
to. I think on the other end, she knowing that she can't get a
hold of me during the day when she needs to get a hold of me is
going to be very, very difficult for her as well. So I'm
nervous about that.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: 162?
MS. SHROFF: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. Any objection to my excusing
her?



MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number, sir?
JUROR: 163.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: So I'm fortunate enough where my employer
funds up to 30 days of jury duty. That being said, they don't
fund seven weeks. So for three weeks, if I'm chosen to be a
juror on this case, I have no source of income. And like
everyone around here, I'm sure we all have expenses and
whatnot. So for three weeks, $60 isn't going to cut my life
essentially.
THE COURT: It would be a financial hardship?
JUROR: For the three weeks after the four weeks, yes,
it would be.
THE COURT: All right. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, if I may just ask, is it 30
business days? Because if so, that will cover six weeks of
trial.
THE COURT: Didn't occur to me.
All right. If you'll have him come back, the other



gentleman.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. Is that 30 business days?
JUROR: Yes, 30 business days. So up to -- yeah, 30
business days.
THE COURT: So that is --
JUROR: That's four weeks and, like, two days,
essentially.
THE COURT: No, that's six weeks.
JUROR: 30 -- I'm not sure if it's 30 business days.
I would have to -- I'd have to follow up. I don't have a phone
so -- it's on the company website. I don't have a phone to
look that up. I can double-check with you. But there's no way
for me to validate that info.
THE COURT: So during the lunch break you can look at
your phone?
JUROR: Yes. And then I can communicate that to all
of you after my lunch break, yeah.
THE COURT: All righty. So I'll be looking forward to
hearing from you.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: What is your number?
JUROR: 164.



THE COURT: And your name please?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I have two little kids, a three and a
five-year-old, and they are in daycare part-time. So on the
days that I am not working or the days that my husband is
working, we share responsibility of pick-up and drop-off. And
there's also the daycare follows the school calendar, and
there's a period of about two and a half weeks at the end of
this month when they are not in daycare until summer camp,
starts July 8th.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thanks.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: She's 164.
MS. SHROFF: Yes, yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: No objection to my excusing her, right?
MS. SHROFF: No.
MS. MURRAY: Correct, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there.
JUROR: 165.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)



THE COURT: Your number, please?
JUROR: 167.
THE COURT: All righty. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. Your number?
JUROR: 168.
THE COURT: And your name please?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I'm a cardiologist at Mt. Sinai, and I see
about 75 patients a week. I also direct a training program.
And this happens to be the transition between graduation and
incoming fellows in the summer. So there's a lot of clinical
activity, but also administrative activity that I would be
missing out on. It would be very disruptive to the whole
cardiology department.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 168?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What is your number?
JUROR: 169.



THE COURT: Okay. And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have a trip that was already planned end of
June/early July. We already bought tickets.
THE COURT: Where are you going?
JUROR: Europe.
THE COURT: Bon voyage. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No objection to my excusing 169?
MS. MURRAY: No objection.
MS. SHROFF: No. Thank you.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 170.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi.
JUROR: 171.
THE COURT: And you may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)



THE COURT: Hi. What is your number?
JUROR: 172.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: Well, I have a seven-year-old that -- recently
my baby-sitter, she had a baby. And I'm the one putting him in
the bus stop. He missed school yesterday.
THE COURT: So you're saying you have nobody else to
take him to the bus stop?
JUROR: As of right now, yes, because she just -- my
baby-sitter had a baby and it was a c-section. She was the one
that was taking care of my son, put him on the bus for me. I
have a problem with my job also coming late.
THE COURT: What do you do?
JUROR: I'm a receptionist.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: And that I enter to --
THE COURT: Okay. If you are on jury duty, will they
pay you for the time you are on jury duty?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: They would. They would.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And if you were to get sick today and you
were in the hospital, who would take care of your son?



JUROR: That, emergencies -- I'm getting separated
from my husband as of right now. And he's also responsible for
him. And when something like emergency, hopefully he will be
able to be there for his son.
THE COURT: But you're saying he's irresponsible?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: No?
JUROR: No, but not like if it's an emergency, he will
say yes, because it's an emergency; I'm in the hospital.
THE COURT: Right.
JUROR: But as coming every day here, he says, No, you
find your way, which I'm trying to find a baby-sitter as of
right now. Just recently, just happened, the baby is like a
week.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing her?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: What was her number?
MS. SHROFF: 172.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi.
JUROR: My number is 173.



THE COURT: Yes. And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: So the problem is I work, and also my husband
has a kidney transplant, he's a transplant. So he works from
home. And I have a child. So seven weeks, if there is any
emergency, I just have to run home. I mean, he's okay, it's --
everything is fine. He had the kidney transplant done in 2016,
so he's fine. But he goes for regular checkup infusion, this,
that, monthly infusion, so that is there.
THE COURT: So does he normally take care of your
child?
JUROR: No, no, he works from home and my daughter
goes to school. But, you know, if there is any school
emergency or my husband's emergency, then it's -- I have to do
it because I don't have any family around, right.
THE COURT: And where do you live?
JUROR: Nanuet, New York, Rockland County.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing her?
MS. MURRAY: I don't see a basis, your Honor, for
excusing her for cause.
THE COURT: All right. Let's bring her back. We'll
bring her back.



(Juror present)
THE COURT: I want to understand your schedule.
Do you work?
JUROR: Yes, I do. I work in a pharmaceutical
company; I'm a scientist. So I work in Tarrytown.
THE COURT: And so if you're serving as a juror, you
will still be paid; is that correct?
JUROR: Oh, yes, yeah. I think so, yeah.
THE COURT: Okay. Now, your daughter, how old did you
say?
JUROR: She is -- she just turned ten.
THE COURT: Okay. And does she take the bus to
school?
JUROR: Yeah, she takes the bus to school.
THE COURT: She goes to the bus stop?
JUROR: No, no, no. We usually take her to the bus
stop. And also --
THE COURT: Who takes her?
JUROR: Either -- most of the time it's me, because I
drop her or take the bus and then I go back to work. Because I
have to also reach work. I'm in research.
THE COURT: So your husband then could take her?
JUROR: My husband can take her. I mean, of course he
works from home, he can definitely take her. But my work
also -- yes, he can take her.



THE COURT: And then at the end of the day?
JUROR: So after the school is over, right now he's
in -- she's in grade four, so she goes to school aftercare.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: So she can stay there till 6 o'clock. But
from here to Rockland County, like yesterday it took me almost
6:40 I reached home.
THE COURT: Is there a bus after --
JUROR: After school care, no, there's no bus.
THE COURT: So someone has to pick her up by car?
JUROR: Yes. From school aftercare there is no bus.
THE COURT: And so your husband can pick her up by
car?
JUROR: Oh, yeah, he can do that. He can definitely
do that. But it's just the emergency. If there is seven
weeks, that's why I'm just like a little concerned.
THE COURT: So you realize that we are only meeting
between 9:30 and 2:45?
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: And so that does give you time.
JUROR: To go back.
THE COURT: To get home, yes?
All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)



THE COURT: All right. You had a good instinct there.
And what number was she?
MS. SHROFF: 173.
THE COURT: 173. Okay.
MS. SHROFF: Should she have an emergency, though, the
government shouldn't ask to replace her.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi, sir. Your number?
JUROR: 174.
THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: It would just -- I mean, work-wise it would
just create a backlog. We have a new director starting at the
museum next month.
THE COURT: What museum?
JUROR: The Guggenheim.
THE COURT: And what is your role there?
JUROR: I lead the marketing department.
THE COURT: Okay. If you were hit by a truck today,
would the Guggenheim be able to find somebody to substitute for
you?
JUROR: Of course.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: I would imagine.



THE COURT: Yes. So anyone who serves as a juror who
has a job often has their work back up, and most of us have
jobs. So you would be in the same position as most ordinary
citizens.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Except that you'd be getting paid.
JUROR: Sure.
THE COURT: Okay. Many people don't get paid for jury
duty.
JUROR: Fair enough. Yes.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 175.
THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: Well, seven weeks would be financially hard
for me because I have like some private chef work that I have
booked for it, like I work as a chef.
THE COURT: And so if you had to be in court, you
would not get paid?
JUROR: I wouldn't get paid for those jobs that I have
booked for the month of -- the end of this month, in June.



It's a busy month for me.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Anybody object to my excusing 175?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 176.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I am a primary caregiver for my
three-month-old grandson.
THE COURT: And what would happen, God forbid, if
you --
JUROR: I have no idea what they are going to do.
They don't have -- maternity leave ends next week. She goes
back Tuesday, and I'm on.
THE COURT: What about a baby-sitter?
JUROR: They don't have a full-time baby-sitter. They
don't have the money to pay for full-time care, to work
full-time.
THE COURT: I'm sorry. I did not understand what you
said with respect to can't they get a baby-sitter?



JUROR: For seven weeks, I don't think they could.
They don't have a baby-sitter. They're new parents who don't
want to leave their three-month-old infant with anybody.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Okay. I'm waiting to hear your positions.
MS. SHROFF: I don't know. I mean, I never had a
three-month-old, so I can't comment; but I would let her go,
but I'm easy.
MS. MURRAY: We have no objection to excusing that
juror.
THE COURT: All righty. No. 176 is excused.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: What is your number?
JUROR: 177.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have a trip, a cruise and a flight, leaving
June 4th and coming back not until June 17th.
THE COURT: And you've already paid for that?
JUROR: Completely paid for. I have the documentation
here if you need to see it.
THE COURT: All righty. Well, have a good time.



JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: You may step back.
JUROR: Okay. Do I leave or --
THE COURT: No, you stay.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No. 177, any objection to my excusing her?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What is your number?
JUROR: 178.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: First, my job will not cover seven weeks of
jury duty.
Secondly, I have several appointments over the next
seven weeks you said the trial was going to be. And also I
have some broadway tickets also coming up in about two weeks.
THE COURT: What kind of tickets?
JUROR: Broadway show tickets.
THE COURT: So if your job is not paying you, would
that be a financial hardship for you?
JUROR: Yes.



THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 178?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 179.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What is your number?
JUROR: 180.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I work at Condé Nast — my work ID is right
here if you want to see it. And I oversee the media company,
the global travel business vertical. I travel very regularly
professionally. I have teams all around the world. And I have
an upcoming important conference in the middle of the seven
weeks in Cannes for the Cannes Lion Creativity Festival, where
I'm required to be in Cannes on June 17th to the 20th.
THE COURT: What would happen if you got hit by a
truck?



JUROR: I guess something very terrible. And I would
be -- you know, depending if I was fatally wounded or not, but
it would be an extreme hardship for the length of this trial.
THE COURT: In other words, Condé Nast would be able
to find somebody to fill your shoes; isn't that right?
JUROR: Not for -- not for this conference. I'm the
most senior stakeholder attending for my business vertical.
THE COURT: So the next most senior person could
attend, right?
JUROR: Currently that spot's open on my team. I
really don't have proper coverage. I'm not saying I couldn't
do it. The question was would it be an extreme hardship
anyway.
THE COURT: I'm not thinking about the hardship for
Condé Nast.
JUROR: For me personally it would be a professional
hardship. And also, additionally, I can't remember if you said
June 28th was a day that the court -- you said a bunch of days
it's not in service. Professionally, that's the day that my
ten-year-old is graduating middle school -- sorry, elementary
school, fifth grade. That might be a day you said we're off.
THE COURT: That is one of the days off, yes.
JUROR: Great.
THE COURT: So you would be paid by Condé Nast if you
were here for jury duty, right?



JUROR: Honestly, I haven't -- I believe so.
That's -- I believe I would. I haven't fully inquired. It's
the first time ever I've been called for jury duty.
THE COURT: I'd like you to make an inquiry during the
lunch hour.
JUROR: Sure.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: What number was she?
MS. SHROFF: 180.
THE COURT: Sir, what is your number?
JUROR: 181.
THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: Three.
First of all, there's a Jewish holiday coming up in
two weeks, I think it is, Shavuot.
THE COURT: And what date is that?
JUROR: If I had my cell phone calendar, I could tell
you.
THE COURT: And does that mean that you need to be
absent that day?
JUROR: Yes, I have to be in synagogue both days.
It's a two-day holiday.



THE COURT: Two-day holiday, you would have to be
gone?
JUROR: Right.
THE COURT: And then?
JUROR: And then if I had my phone, I could give you
precise dates for this also.
THE COURT: I'll figure out the dates.
JUROR: No, it's something else.
We have two grandchildren who are graduating from a
school in Baltimore. And I think -- I think it's next week or
the week after, I can't remember which.
And then the third is I'm 74 years old, so I think I
read somewhere in while we're waiting that if you're above 70,
you can be exempted. Am I -- do I have that wrong?
THE COURT: So I have had people in their 90s serve.
JUROR: I'm sure you have, but --
THE COURT: I don't know of that particular rule, but
I'll look into it.
JUROR: Please. Thank you.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: But those other two are regardless.
THE COURT: What about the graduation date, do you
know when that is?
JUROR: I can tell you the names of the schools. And
if I had a cell phone, I could.



THE COURT: Go ahead. What school?
JUROR: One school is called Beth Tefiloh.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: In Baltimore.
THE COURT: Yup.
JUROR: And the other is Krieger Schechter Jewish
State School or Day School.
THE COURT: All righty. So you may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Do we know when Shavuot is?
THE LAW CLERK: Tuesday through Thursday, the 11th of
June.
THE COURT: Three days.
THE LAW CLERK: Starts the evening on June 11.
THE COURT: Wednesday and Thursday?
THE LAW CLERK: Yeah.
THE COURT: Okay. What is your position? That
holiday is a Wednesday and a Thursday; so it would mean that we
would have to miss court on those days if he were chosen.
MS. SHROFF: I say we keep him and we take Wednesday
and Thursday off.
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, we would say he should be
excused for cause.
THE COURT: I don't know anything about this rule of



over 70, does anybody?
MS. SHROFF: You have to apply for the exemption. So
he didn't apply. If he applied for the exemption, he wouldn't
have to come at all.
THE COURT: Okay. Is there any objection to my
excusing him?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. So 181 is excused.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: So I am 182.
THE COURT: 182. And your name?
JUROR: It's XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
So I have a trip with my wife scheduled for June 2nd,
for that week, to London. I also have on June 12th my son's
graduation from high school -- not high school, from -- yeah,
from high school, senior in high school.
And but in addition to those, I just thought I wanted
to bring to your attention, I know it's not the question, but I
have a very active white-collar criminal defense practice. I'm
the chair and founder of the practice at a large law firm. So
I have a number of cases currently against Southern District.
And the practice as a whole has a whole bunch of cases that I
sometimes consult on. So it's just -- but, you know, it just
presents a challenge personally as a conflict.



THE COURT: Where do you work?
JUROR: At Goodwin Procter.
THE COURT: You can step back.
JUROR: Sure.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 182?
MR. KAMARAJU: No.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: What number are you?
JUROR: 183.
THE COURT: Your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: So I'm the only working -- I have a family,
right. My husband is disabled. And I'm the only caretaker and
the mother of my daughter. So was able to take my kids to
school and take care of them, whether they're at school or out
of school. I'm the only one who takes care of them because
he's physically disabled.
THE COURT: How old are your children?
JUROR: 13 and 8.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 183?



MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 184.
THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: I own and operate a horse farm in northern
Westchester.
THE COURT: Where?
JUROR: In Katonah, New York. And I own it with my
brother and operate it with him.
You mentioned would anyone have a hardship. In
January, my brother received a kidney transplant and is
recovering. And I am under tremendous pressure to keep the
business going and manage it as the face of the business while
he's recovering.
I have 100 horses at the farm, 50 employees and
clients and owners of the horses, that it's very important that
the level of care and confidence be maintained, which I am
basically doing double duty. So for me to be away from the
business in a two-month stint would be devastating to what I
do. I am doing double duty as it is.
THE COURT: Devastating financially?



JUROR: Yes. I mean, it's important for me to be
there. I have 51 employees, many of them are highly managed
because it's all about care. And I administer medication to
horses, I am managing rehab of horses, travel to competitions
with horses.
It wasn't easy for me to come here today to do a
one-day commitment. I postponed my jury duty three times
because of these types of commitments.
My brother is recovering. So he goes two days a week
to Columbia to have his blood drawn, monitoring his
anti-rejection medications. So it's important, you know, that
I am there watching what we do, managing what we do.
And I'm already dealing with a pivotal moment in my
working life and career. You know, I'm working harder than I
ever have and watching every single thing we do to keep it
together. So it would be -- it would be devastating for me to
be away from it.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 184?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, he did say that he has 51
employees. Even when you inquired of his financial hardship,
he hesitated and then said yes, but didn't go further into



that. It sounded like it would be more of an inconvenience for
him just as a general person with a job. With our schedule and
the occasional days and weekends that we have off, it does seem
other employees would be able to fill in.
THE COURT: All right. If you would ask him to come
back.
So we'll just take the next individual. We'll just
ask for him to come back.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 185.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I already have trips booked for the end of
June and July.
THE COURT: Where are you going?
JUROR: I'm going to Maine in June and I'm going to
Antigua in July.
THE COURT: And you have plane tickets?
JUROR: I don't have them on me.
THE COURT: No, I'm saying did you buy your plane
tickets?
JUROR: Yes. Yeah.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty. You may step back.



(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 185?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 188.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: My job. I'm a case manager and I have a
specific case order of clients that work with me directly. And
I'm -- in my job, I'm the only one that facilitate them to
legal services as well. They're homeless clients.
THE COURT: Do you work for an agency?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: What agency?
JUROR: Breaking Ground.
THE COURT: And what is your title?
JUROR: Case manager.
THE COURT: Are you a social worker?
JUROR: Affiliated with it.
THE COURT: So if you serve jury duty, do you get paid
by the agency?
JUROR: Yes.



THE COURT: So if, God forbid, you were hit by a truck
today, someone else at the agency would take over your
caseload, right?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: What?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. So it may be an inconvenience for
your employer, but it's not an impossibility to cover you
essentially, right?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 189.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: The time length, the seven week. I have a
holiday, religious holiday, during that time. And I wanted to
also let you know, like, Fridays, because of the Sabbath, 5
o'clock is a little bit late for where I have to drive to
because I live in Rockland County, with traffic and everything.
THE COURT: So we're going to stop at 2:45.
JUROR: Oh, I just want -- you said tomorrow. So I



wasn't sure.
THE COURT: Well, let's assume that we can stop early
tomorrow. What time would you need to leave here?
JUROR: Like 3:30-ish, 4.
THE COURT: Okay. So let's assume that we're able to
accommodate that. Then we have the holiday. Do you know what
the dates are for the holiday?
JUROR: I don't really know offhand. I think it's in
like two weeks.
THE COURT: Are you thinking about Shavuot?
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: Okay. I believe --
JUROR: Or it's two and a half. I don't have the
phone with me to look to get --
THE COURT: So I believe that that would mean that you
would have to be absent a Tuesday and a Wednesday?
JUROR: Yeah, I think so. It's in the middle of the
week.
THE COURT: Okay. So if you were able to have those
two days off, knowing that you're going to be able to leave
here at 2:45, then otherwise you'd be able to serve?
JUROR: I think so. I just started a business, but
whatever I'm saying, I understand that there's a jury and stuff
like that, so --
THE COURT: So --



JUROR: Like I'm understanding, but I did happen -- I
did just happen to start.
THE COURT: What kind of business?
JUROR: A handyman business.
THE COURT: Okay. So when did you start it?
JUROR: Like two weeks ago.
THE COURT: Okay. And so I assume that you're -- is
it you're looking for clients now?
JUROR: Yeah, I'm getting calls, stuff like that.
THE COURT: Okay. So if you are out for seven weeks,
is that going to be a financial hardship for you?
JUROR: A little bit, yeah, I think, because I'm
getting my name out there. If I don't answer the phones
anymore, like, a little bit, yeah.
THE COURT: Do you have to pay rent or are you living
somewhere where you don't have to pay rent?
JUROR: No, I'm paying rent.
THE COURT: You are paying rent. Okay. So would you
be able to pay rent without this handyman job?
JUROR: Yeah, I would be able to swing it. It
wouldn't be easy, but I would be able to.
THE COURT: Okay. Would you be able to pay for food
and your other basic necessities?
JUROR: Yeah, I'd be able to make do.
THE COURT: You would be able to make do.



Okay. All righty. So you can --
JUROR: Not convenient, but I would be able to make
do.
THE COURT: I understand.
JUROR: Like everyone.
THE COURT: It's maybe an annoyance or an
inconvenience, but you would be able to manage somehow.
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: Okay. Please step back.
JUROR: Thank you very much.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: All right. So the question is whether or
not we take out -- we take off the two days for Shavuot.
MS. MURRAY: We would propose to keep him for now,
your Honor. We can see what happens. And I guess the question
would be whether that would change the opinion of Juror 181.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, it can't be that we'll see
how this goes, right. Either we excuse him for cause, because
we shouldn't have to exercise a peremptory without deciding
whether or not we're going to sit on those two days.
THE COURT: So I am obligated to afford him the
opportunity to sit.
MS. SHROFF: Right.
THE COURT: If he has a religious obligation, the
question only becomes can we accommodate that reasonably. And



since you are -- since -- what is the date?
THE LAW CLERK: The 12th and 13th.
THE COURT: Of June. It's the 12th and 13th of June.
You have a plan for what would happen on those dates,
and I'd need to know whether we can make that reasonable
accommodation.
MS. MURRAY: Can we have a moment, your Honor.
(Counsel conferred)
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, we propose to keep him for
now. We understand Ms. Shroff's objection. We might strike
him at a later point.
THE COURT: Of course you cannot strike him though for
religious reasons.
MS. MURRAY: No, no, no, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can I just ask, because I think didn't
we let another juror go for cause for the same reason?
THE COURT: No, no, no, no. Remember he had other
issues.
MS. MURRAY: Grandkids graduating.
THE COURT: I would never dismiss a person for cause
because of their religious obligations.
MR. KAMARAJU: I understand.
THE COURT: He had two graduations and there was the
issue of his elderly status.
MR. KAMARAJU: I understand the point you're making.



Thank you, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, just so we're clear, we're
happy to have the juror stay within the pool, right.
THE COURT: Yes.
MS. SHROFF: But if he's in the pool, there's going to
be no argument about him not having those two days off. We
just want to make sure the government is clear that they don't
come back and then say ask the man to accommodate and not get
him his religious services.
MS. MURRAY: Absolutely not, Ms. Shroff. If he's on
the jury --
THE COURT: If they come back to me and say that they
have spent already thousands of dollars, government dollars, in
order to fly in certain witnesses, that is something that I
would consider.
MS. SHROFF: Then I think, your Honor, most
respectfully, maybe we can ask the juror. Because I'm pretty
sure that he would be observant of those two holidays and want
those days off.
THE COURT: Yes. What I'm saying is that I would
afford him the opportunity to be off for those two days.
However, if the prosecution comes back to me and says the
government will have expended $15,000 in flights for witnesses,
then I have to make an assessment as to whether it is
reasonable to accommodate him for those two days.



MS. SHROFF: That's what we would object to, your
Honor. I think he has a right to have a religious
accommodation, number one; and number two, your Honor, the
government is right here. They can figure out what they're
doing on the 12th and the 13th now before they do that to the
juror.
THE COURT: I'm going to allow them some time to
assess the situation.
MS. SHROFF: Right. Maybe they can tell us by 2
o'clock before we have to pay --
THE COURT: Or by the end of the day.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT: All righty.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, your number again?
JUROR: 184.
THE COURT: Okay. So I'm sorry to hear about your
brother's condition and I understand that he is only working
limited hours.
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: And you're having to work overtime because
of his condition.
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: So what would happen now if you were
completely incapacitated? Let us say that you land in the



hospital for the next two months, what would happen to your
business?
JUROR: It would be severely impacted.
THE COURT: How so?
JUROR: It would deteriorate. I would lose clients.
I would lose revenue. It would be -- it would fall apart.
THE COURT: So are you principally boarding the
horses?
JUROR: Yes, boarding, training, and most of the
horses there are client-owned.
THE COURT: All right. So my sense is that there
isn't a tremendous amount of facilities like your own in the
immediate area. There may be others, but there's not a whole
lot of them; am I correct?
JUROR: There are, for sure, other places to go. And
the clients could afford to do it wherever they want to do it.
It's about confidence. So they -- so I would lose
that confidence. And I would lose that -- I made written
application twice trying to be excluded from jury duty, and I
never heard back on either of those, explaining my situation,
explaining the circumstances. My brother has a very rare
kidney disease.
THE COURT: I understand that, sir. But what I'm
trying to assess -- I understand that you have a fear that you
would lose customers, lose revenue. But --



JUROR: In a significant way. In a very significant
way.
THE COURT: How significantly?
JUROR: It would devastate -- like, you know, if I
lose a number of clients, I would lose the revenue. I'd have
to lay people off. It would fall apart. I'm trying to get
through this period of his recovery time. Like you said, he's
come back in a limited, let's say, light duty, and he is the
face of the business with me. And I am trying to, like, get
the business up in this period of time.
THE COURT: So what percentage of revenue do you think
that you would lose if you were serving as a juror for seven
weeks?
JUROR: I could lose as much as 50 percent. People.
THE COURT: You're saying that people --
JUROR: They see --
THE COURT: -- who have been your --
JUROR: Clients.
THE COURT: -- loyal clients would just simply turn
their backs on you and find some other business to take care of
their horses?
JUROR: Yeah. I mean, my brother had the transplant.
We kept it quiet until, like, a week before. Because when a
client wants something, I was afraid they would send you
flowers and move the horses the next day. And it's been that



whole pressure of that, like, keeping it together. I mean, I'm
literally sweating here thinking that, like, I cannot do this
for two months.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So I do have familiarity with his
clientele. And my sense is that they expect a great deal of
service and attention. And although I am not an expert in the
field, I do think that it's quite conceivable that he could
lose substantial business. And so I think that he has stated a
legitimate reason for being excused.
MS. MURRAY: We agree, your Honor. We defer to the
Court.
THE COURT: All right. He was one --
MS. SHROFF: 84.
THE COURT: 184 is excused.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, what is your number?
JUROR: 191.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: So my main hardship is work responsibilities.



I'm an engineer here in the city working for a large firm.
Many projects, many people working under me, very tight
deadlines.
THE COURT: What type of engineering?
JUROR: Environmental engineering. I'm a geologist.
THE COURT: And what would happen if you were hit by a
truck today?
JUROR: Well, then it wouldn't be my responsibility
anymore. But, you know --
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: So I don't know, I mean --
THE COURT: So would they be able to find another
engineer?
JUROR: I'm sure they would hire another engineer,
yes. But they wouldn't be able to step right into my shoes and
do the job.
THE COURT: They'd have to have a certain amount of
time to rev up?
JUROR: Right. And the problem is, with tight
deadlines, that's where the main issue comes in.
THE COURT: So if you serve as a juror, are you going
to be paid by your firm?
JUROR: So up to two weeks I know. I don't know up to
seven weeks. I was never contemplated -- or I never
contemplated up to seven weeks.



THE COURT: You can find out during the break, the
lunch break?
JUROR: Oh, I can try. Sure.
THE COURT: Okay. That's what I'd like you to do.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, what is your number?
JUROR: 192.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: Is XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I'm a single father to a ten-year old who will
be finishing school June 18th. Tomorrow is a half a day. I
don't have coverage in the mornings. I am responsible for the
mornings. My daughter is dropped off, I go to work. There is
a caregiver in the evenings, but I do everything as a single
father.
I am a widower. And I had served jury in this --
Colleen McMahon's courtroom in the past. I understand jury
duty. I respect the process. But, unfortunately, in this time
I ask that I am excused based on my availability I don't have.
THE COURT: Where do you live?
JUROR: In Manhattan.
THE COURT: And you cannot get a sitter?



JUROR: I do the morning routine. I do the breakfast,
dress, and off to school drop-off. I don't know how to get a
sitter to show up at 7:30 in the morning to make that process
take place.
THE COURT: What do you do for a living?
JUROR: I work in finance. I'm a financial adviser.
THE COURT: And you're aware that there are
baby-sitting agencies?
JUROR: Which I have engaged. I have a caregiver who
does my evenings. She does pickups from school and then leaves
8 o'clock, essentially. I have a daily caregiver for the
after-school session. I do the morning sessions.
THE COURT: And so when is it that your daughter
leaves the house?
JUROR: She drops off by 8 a.m. She gets to school at
8 a.m.
THE COURT: Okay. And where do you live in Manhattan?
JUROR: 73rd and Third.
THE COURT: Okay. So that gives you plenty of time to
get here by 9:30.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: Very well. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
MS. SHROFF: You are one tough cookie. I would have
let him go.



(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there.
JUROR: How are you?
THE COURT: Fine. And you?
JUROR: Fine, thanks.
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 193.
THE COURT: Okay. And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I'm going to be in Denver, Colorado next week
for my grandmother's funeral.
THE COURT: I'm so sorry to hear that.
All righty. I understand. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: What is the number?
MS. SHROFF: 193.
THE COURT: Okay. All right. She is excused.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: So, sir, your number?
JUROR: 194.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And -- excuse me?



JUROR: I'm just a little nervous.
THE COURT: All righty. What is the problem?
JUROR: It takes me over two hours to get here and two
hours to get home, and just something that I cannot do. It's
just too much for me.
On top of that, being in a high-rise in Lower
Manhattan is really freaking me out. I can't stand being here.
I can't stand looking out the windows. My anxiety level is
beyond. If this is where the trial is going to be, I don't
think I can do it.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing him?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, I have to be before Judge
Cote at 1.
THE COURT: Understood. Thanks.
What is your number?
JUROR: 180. I just -- I'm still going to check with
my employer about that question about compensation at the
break. But I gave the wrong date accidentally for my
daughter's graduation. It's the 25th, June 25th. Actually,
the last day of school is June 26th. But it's only from 8:30



to 10:30 in the morning, but it's Tuesday, June 25th.
THE COURT: All right. All righty. You may step
back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: All right. We're going to stop for now
and we will continue after the lunch break at 2 o'clock.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you, your Honor.
(In open court)
THE COURT: All righty.
Everyone, please return to your seats.
We are done with our work for the morning, but we
still have more to go. The night is young.
So I'll need you to return very, very promptly at 2
o'clock. So you'll be in the hallway at 2 o'clock. Not coming
into the building, not the elevator, but in the hallway right
out there ready to walk in at 2 o'clock sharp. If you're late,
it really makes it quite difficult for us to do our own work.
So many people are involved. So be prompt.
I want you to not discuss this matter amongst
yourselves. Don't let anyone talk to you about the case.
You're not to talk with anybody else about the case.
Also, the lawyers are not permitted to have any
contact with you. So if you see them in the hallway, in the
elevator, on the street, and they don't greet you, they don't
look at you, it's not that they are being rude, it's that they



may not have any contact whatsoever with you.
Have a good lunch.
(Venire not present)
THE COURT: All right. Time for lunch.
Have a good lunch.
(Luncheon recess)
(Continued on next page)



AFTERNOON SESSION

2:02 p.m.
THE COURT: All right. I'm going to rule on some of
the outstanding motions.
I received the government's letter motion dated
May 21, 2024, and the defendant's response dated May 23rd. ECF
Nos. 344 and 349. And the government first moves to
preliminarily admit certain statements made by alleged
co-conspirators, Qidong Xia and David Dai, under exceptions to
the hearsay rule. The government intends to call two people
whom I will identify as Victim-1 and Victim-2 to testify about
statements. These statements include: (1) instructions by Xia
telling Victim-1 where to wire funds to make purported
investments in GTV stock, as well as Xia denying Victim-1 a
refund on this investment; (2) statements by Dai instructing
Victim-2 how to open certain bank accounts and where to wire
the funds in those bank accounts; and (3) the statement by Xia
to Victim-2 regarding the appointment of the new leader of the
London Farm.
As I previously ruled in my May 2nd order, consistent
with the Second Circuit's Geaney protocol, I may admit
co-conspirator statements on a conditional basis, subject to
the later submission of the necessary evidence to establish
that the co-conspirator exception is applicable. The
government's motion identifies the statements with sufficient



particularity and is therefore granted.
As with the co-conspirator statements I conditionally
admitted in my May 2nd order when I partially granted
government motion 1, I will make the required Geaney findings
outside the presence of the jury at the close of the
government's case, and, if necessary, give an appropriate
limiting instruction.
Second, the government moves to preclude evidence
regarding the March 15, 2023, fire at Mr. Guo's apartment at
the Sherry-Netherland Hotel. The defense does not intend to
introduce such evidence. Accordingly, the government's motion
is denied as moot.
Third, the government moves to preclude Mr. Guo from
introducing any evidence of the potential immigration
consequences of his conviction. Mr. Guo again states that he
does not intend to introduce such evidence. Accordingly, the
government's motion is denied as moot.
We're waiting for the members of the panel to finish
gathering.
(Jury venire present)
(At the sidebar, juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 195.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.



THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: Well, it takes me about two and a half hours
to get here from like the northernmost part of Putnam County.
I'm also a home care physical therapist, so to be out of work
for seven weeks would be a bit much.
THE COURT: In what regard?
JUROR: Just as far as my patients and, you know, for
the agency.
THE COURT: Would you get paid for those seven weeks?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: So aside from the commute, if you were
struck by a car, someone would——
JUROR: You asked for extreme circumstances, so I
guess my circumstances aren't terribly extreme, but this
process does intimidate me a little bit as well, so——
THE COURT: But you can handle it, right?
JUROR: Yeah, well, I don't know.
THE COURT: What do you mean you don't know?
JUROR: I've never gone through it. I've never sat on
a jury before, so——
THE COURT: Are there any things you know so far that
would impair your ability to sit?
JUROR: Not really.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back. Thank you.
(Juror not present)



(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What number are you?
JUROR: 196.
THE COURT: 196. Yes. You were going to come back
with some information for us.
JUROR: Regarding my——I can't afford to lose, like,
another month of paycheck because we are paid by——per diem——I
mean, by flight time, 'cause I'm a flight attendant.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: And say, for example, my schedule is like
three trips in a row; I only get like paid, like, you know, the
flight time and I lose the per diem. And on top of that, I
just came back from an injury. I lost two months of work. And
I'm trying to make up for those lost income, and actually, I
just borrowed some money from my 401(k) just to stay, you know,
afloat, yeah.
THE COURT: So you're saying it would be a financial
hardship?
JUROR: Correct, correct.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 196?
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.



(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 197.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I work in a private school, in the technology
department, and June is our clutch cargo month of the whole
year. It's more busy than it is at the beginning of the year
because we have to collect all the devices, we have to take the
rooms apart so that the maintenance can repaint, reoutfit with
new technology. On top of that, my own daughter is graduating
this year, so I have some ceremonies to go to for that as well.
THE COURT: Is she graduating from that school?
JUROR: No, from another high school, a public school.
THE COURT: Do you know what the dates are?
JUROR: Her graduation is I believe the 29th.
THE COURT: Of?
JUROR: Of June. And the beginning is the private
school's graduation that I'm working, as well as other
ceremonies, moving up ceremonies.
THE COURT: So if you were hit by a truck today, would
the private school be able to find somebody to do your job?
JUROR: Sure. They'd have to figure that out, yeah.
THE COURT: Yeah. Okay. And if you were able to



attend your daughter's graduation on the 29th of June,
otherwise, you'd be able to serve; is that correct?
JUROR: Yeah, I guess, technically.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: All right.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I'm not going to excuse him.
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, I would just note the 29th is
a Saturday.
THE COURT: Oh.
MS. SHROFF: June 28th?
MS. MURRAY: He graduates on the 29th.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What's your number?
JUROR: 198.
THE COURT: 198. And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's your last name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: So my son has a few weeks left in school and
he has special medical needs. He has Type I diabetes like
myself, so when his school ends, he will be at home with us.
And I say this, "us," because my wife is also in jury duty
right now, and so we don't know——we were expecting it would be



a three-week case, we would be able to be fine. Anything
longer than that, if we were both here, then we would not be
able to take care of him.
THE COURT: And do you have any sitters that you can
use?
JUROR: I mean, typically we do, but it's when we have
devices on us to be able to communicate with the sitter,
because I usually track his blood sugar on my phone, which I
cannot today. I have my own, tracking my own. So it would be
difficult to be able to coordinate care in that situation.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing
Juror No. 198?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What's your number?
JUROR: 201.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
JUROR: That's it?
THE COURT: That's it.

THE COURT: Hi.
JUROR: Hi. 180.
THE COURT: You were going to check about——
JUROR: I did. I did. I tried very hard in the 40,
50 minutes I was off, not to be late. I didn't get through to
anyone. And I called, I emailed, I Slacked. I didn't——I
didn't get the answer to that question. I'm under the
assumption that I——my employment would not be in jeopardy. It
just would be a really, really, really bad time based on the
conference that I told you about and my work should be getting
back online.
THE COURT: Understood. All righty.
(Juror not present)
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, does somebody have the date
of her son's graduation? 25th?
MS. MURRAY: It was 25th in the morning.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What is your number, sir?
JUROR: 163.
THE COURT: And your name again?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And you were looking up something for us.
JUROR: Yeah. So I was able to confirm that it's 30
business days, but that still leaves one week where I don't
have income other than what I'm paid to be here, which is $60 a



day. I would have to ask my employer if I could potentially
get an extension on getting more jury duty days, but as of
right now, it's 30 business days confirmed.
THE COURT: Okay. I'd like you to contact your
employer——
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: ——and make that inquiry.
JUROR: Okay. I'll send them an email tonight and
then I'm assuming tomorrow I'll call up with an update or
whatever.
THE COURT: I'd like you to do that sooner, but I'm
going to think about it.
JUROR: Oh, okay. Do you still need me or——
THE COURT: I don't, no.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So we can see where we stand at the end of
the day.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What number are you?
JUROR: 191.
THE COURT: 191. Go ahead. You were going to make an
inquiry for us.
JUROR: I wasn't able to find out. So I don't have my
work phone with me because they wouldn't let me bring my phone,



so the people I called didn't know. I can find out by 5:00
tonight, after 5, when I leave here, but I just——I wasn't able
to find out.
THE COURT: All right. We'll be in touch.
JUROR: All right. Cool. Thanks.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. Your number?
JUROR: 113.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I just learned during the break that my
company will not cover my salary during the extent of the case
if I were to be chosen as a juror, and I cannot afford not to
have that income. I'm a single family——single-income family of
five. I'm responsible for mortgage and three children in a
private school. And I just wouldn't be able to meet my
responsibilities if I weren't going to get my salary on a
regular basis.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing
No. 113?
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.



MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, I'm just curious what company
he works for that doesn't pay for jury duty.
THE COURT: All right. Well, we'll get him back after
we hear from this juror.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi again. Hi there. What was the date of
the graduation you have to attend?
JUROR: June 25th, Tuesday.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: What number was she? 180. She is 180.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi, sir. Who is your employer?
JUROR: Culinary Group.
THE COURT: What is that?
JUROR: Dining services.
THE COURT: Dining services. All right. You may step
back.
(Juror not present)
MS. MURRAY: No objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: That's it?
(In open court)
THE COURT: Do any of you have any personal knowledge
of the charges in this case?
Please step up.



(At the sidebar; juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What is your number? 101?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: You can step back.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 133.
THE COURT: And what is the issue?
JUROR: Well, personal knowledge, not like about the
specifics, all that, but I work in PR. I read the news
religiously all day, every day, in particular investigative
reporters that I work with, so I have read a lot of press. I
read The New York Times cover to cover every day, and I know
that just a month ago, one of the investigative reporters that
we read whatever they write, wrote a very big, long article, so
I understand the details of the case in a way that maybe——
THE COURT: So you're 133.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, would it make sense for the
attorneys to stay here?
THE COURT: That's fine if you want to.
MS. MURRAY: That's fine with us, if it's more



efficient.
THE COURT: Yes.
MS. MURRAY: Thank you.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Is there anything about the nature of the
charges that would prevent you from being a fair and impartial
juror?
(At the sidebar; juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. You're No. 101?
JUROR: 103.
THE COURT: 103? You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 123.
THE COURT: You're 123?
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 133.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What number are you?
JUROR: 144.



THE COURT: Did you say 144?
JUROR: 144.
THE COURT: 144. And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what did you want to tell me?
JUROR: I've personally invested in lifestyle branding
in——within the cryptocurrency space, and I——I never got my
money back.
THE COURT: Are you saying that you invested in an
entity associated with the defendant here, Mr. Guo?
JUROR: No, not his, one of his companies, although I
do know of G Coin and some of his subsidiaries.
THE COURT: So would that prevent you from being a
fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: Why?
JUROR: Because I've——I felt like I was robbed of my
money.
THE COURT: So you don't——you had no direct dealings
with any of Mr. Guo's entities; is that correct?
JUROR: No. Correct.
THE COURT: So can you put aside your negative
experience that you had in dealing with another entity and come
into the courtroom with an open mind and listen to the witness
testimony and review the documentary evidence and be a fair and



impartial juror?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All righty. Then step back, sir.
(Juror not present)
MR. KAMARAJU: We're going to register an objection
that he should be excused for cause, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. I think that he was
rehabilitated.
MR. KAMARAJU: I think his original answer was that he
felt that he had been defrauded by cryptocurrency and that he
had outside knowledge of the case and was familiar with G Coins
already.
MS. SHROFF: He said he was robbed, not even
defrauded. He said he was robbed, and your Honor——
THE COURT: Let's bring him back.
MS. SHROFF: Also, it's very hard to say no to a
judge.
THE COURT: It's all right. I'm only 4 foot 11½.
MS. SHROFF: So am I. And we're both ferocious.
(Juror present again)
THE COURT: So you mentioned that you had some
familiarity with entities related to Mr. Guo; is that right?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: That familiarity, would that prevent you
from being a fair and impartial juror?



JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: What is the number?
ALL COUNSEL: 144.
THE COURT: All right. So he is dismissed for cause.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 129.
THE COURT: You may step back.
JUROR: I may step back? Oh.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What is your number? 134? All righty.
You may step back.
JUROR: Oh, okay.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. Your number?
JUROR: 134. Or 143. Sorry.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
JUROR: Like this? Oh.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 162.



THE COURT: You may step back.
JUROR: Okay. Go back?
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 165.
THE COURT: You may go back.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
JUROR: Hi.
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 176.
THE COURT: You may go back.
JUROR: Go back? You don't want me here?
THE COURT: You can go back.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number again?
JUROR: 184.
THE COURT: You may go back.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 185.
THE COURT: You may go back.
(Juror not present)



(In open court)
THE COURT: The government is represented here by the
United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York,
Damian Williams. This trial will be in the immediate charge of
Assistant United States Attorneys Micah Fergenson, Ryan Finkel,
Justin Horton, and Juliana Murray. They will be assisted by
paralegals Michael Gartland, Isabelle Loftus, and Geoffrey
Mearns.
Please stand and face the jurors.
The defendant in the case is Miles Guo.
Mr. Guo, please stand and face the jurors.
Mr. Guo is represented by his attorneys Sidhardha
Kamaraju and Sabrina Shroff, Matthew Barkan and E. Scott
Schirick. Mr. Kamaraju and Mr. Barkan are with the law firm of
Pryor Cashman LLP, and Mr. Schirick is with the law firm of
Alston & Bird. Do any of you know Mr. Guo or any of the
individuals that I have just identified?
Have any of you, your family members, or close friends
had any personal or business dealings, directly or indirectly,
with any of these individuals, including the defendant?
Have any of you, or your relatives or close friends,
had any association or business dealings with any member of the
staff of Pryor Cashman LLP or Alston & Bird?
What is your number?
JUROR: 127.



THE COURT: And your dealings?
JUROR: They were adversaries on cases, and I know
people at the law firm.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
JUROR: Juror 144. I've worked with an attorney at
Pryor Cashman as a client.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: Likewise. Oh, Juror 182. Likewise. I know
lawyers at both Pryor Cashman and Alston & Bird.
THE COURT: Okay. Anybody else?
I'm now going to read the names of potential witnesses
in this case as well as other individuals whose names may be
mentioned during the trial:
Aaron Mitchell. Adalberto Cattabriga. Alex Soltani.
Alex Hadjicharalambous. Alexandra Gale. Amin Shams. Amy
Buck. Ana Izquierdo. Andrew Zitman. Anthony Alecci. Anthony
Dibatista. Anthony Martinez. Ava Chan. Baorong Liu. Bin
Guo. BJ Pendergast. Bo Collins. Bruce Frederick. Chelsea
Grady. Chingwa Wang. Do any of you know any of these
individuals or have any of your family members or close friends
had dealings, directly or indirectly, with those individuals?
I'm now going to read another list of names:
Christina Schatz. Christine Frosini. Christine Li.
Courtney Benitez. Crystal Wang. Damon Lope. Daniel
Podhaskie. Darren Blanton. Darren Loos. David Lasky. Defeng



Cao, also known as Wayne. Doaa Dashoush. Ehsan Haque. Ehsan
Mahsud. Elaine Dellapia. Erica Buonocore. Erin McNamara.
Fay Fay. Gabriela Luciano. Do any of you know or have any of
your family members or close friends had any dealings, directly
or indirectly, with those people?
JUROR: Juror 144. I don't know if it's any relation,
but Christina Li.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
Do any of you know or have you had direct dealings
with the following people:
Giacomo Mattioli; Gladys Chow; Haidong Hao; Haitham
Khaled; Haley Richins; Haoran He; Hongfei Guo; Isabelle
Despins; Jamie Wilson; Jammy Tam; Janie Du; Jason Miller; Jenny
Li; Jeremy Tempkin; Jesse Brown; Jessica Mastrogiovanni;
Jessica Volchko; Jian Peng; and Jianhu Yi? Anyone?
JUROR: Juror 169. The name's probably kind of
common, but Jason Miller is a counterparty at a vendor.
THE COURT: You said you were 169? Okay. Thank you.
Anyone else?
JUROR: 182. Jeremy Tempkin is a close friend of
mine.
THE COURT: Thank you.
All right. I'm going to read some more names:
Jieyu Bian. John Morgan. Joseph Hugdahl. Juliana
Lister. Justine Atwood. Karin Maistrello. Katherine Miles.



Katrina Laperuta. Kelly Noh. Kevin Ma. Kin Min (William) Je.
Kit Addleman. Kyle Bass. Lan You. Le Zhou. Lee Chu.
Limarie Reyes Molinaris. Lin Chao. Lonny Soza. Louie
Bonsoukan.
Anyone?
JUROR: Juror 141. Kyle Bass is a client of my firm,
a large broker-dealer.
THE COURT: Anybody else?
JUROR: Juror 169. A co-worker, Kevin Ma.
THE COURT: Juror 141, would you step up, please.
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: So I thought you folks were going to
remain here.
MR. FERGENSON: Then when you introduced us, we wanted
to be at the table.
THE COURT: Oh, that's a good idea. Very good.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: All righty. Sir, you're number 141?
JUROR: 141.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is your relationship with Kyle
Bass?
JUROR: So I work in prime brokerage, and we finance
his——his hedge fund, Hayman Capital, so we lend them stock, we



lend them money to make investments, and I talk to his staff,
and I've talked to him probably a few times but usually just
his staff. He's covered all my team. So the guy who sits
right beside me covers Hayman, and I back him up a lot.
THE COURT: Do you have any strong feelings about him?
JUROR: No, not particularly. I know he's got
feelings about China, and I've seen him on CNBC all the time,
but my interaction is pretty limited with him. It's more with
his——Hayman Capital.
THE COURT: Do you have any feelings about Hayman
Capital?
JUROR: Not particularly. It's just one of our hedge
fund clients.
THE COURT: If I were to tell you that he would be a
witness in this case, would you be able to judge his testimony
in the same way that you would judge anyone else's testimony?
JUROR: I think so.
THE COURT: What do you mean you think so?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Would you feel that you had to see him
favorably, more favorably than another witness because of your
business relationship with him?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you have a bias against him?
JUROR: No.



THE COURT: All right. You can step back, for a
moment. You'll just step back to where this young lady is
standing.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: What do you want me to ask?
MR. KAMARAJU: Just if the fact that the case involves
allegations regarding an investment at Hayman, whether that
would affect his ability to be impartial at all.
MS. SHROFF: Also, your Honor, I think that he should
be told that Mr. Bass is a cooperating witness for the
government.
MR. FINKEL: Whoa.
MS. SHROFF: Please don't interrupt me. I'm speaking.
You're free to talk after me.
The government is going to call Kyle Bass as its
witness. He would literally have to return a verdict——he would
have to feel confident that he could return a verdict and not
have a problem telling Kyle Bass or anyone who works for Kyle
Bass that, I sided with the other side. So that would be an
issue, right? Kyle Bass is going to testify. He manages Kyle
Bass's fund. Part of his income depends on what Kyle Bass and
Kyle Bass's fund does. So somebody would actually have to have
the strength to return a verdict against that entity for whom
they work. I mean, you'd have to have——
THE COURT: So isn't there an inherent conflict?



MS. SHROFF: Yes. That's why he should be excused for
cause, without a doubt.
MR. FINKEL: No objection.
MR. KAMARAJU: That's our view.
THE COURT: All righty. I'm going to dismiss him for
cause.
MR. FINKEL: Just for the record, Kyle Bass is not a
cooperating witness.
THE COURT: Okay. That's it.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Going through another list of names:
Lu Zhu. Luc Despins. Madeleine Despins. Maggie
Sklar. Maggie Murphy. Marios Mamzeris. Mark Williams.
Marvin James Sawyer. Matt Smith. Matteo Gandini. Matthew
Pottinger. Max Krasner. Mei Guo. Melissa Baccari. Melissa
Francis. Melissa Mendez. Meng Tong Zang. Minran Wu. Na
Zhou. Nicholas DiMarino.
Anyone familiar with those individuals or have any
relatives or close friends who have dealings with those
individuals?
Nickie Lum Davis. Nicole Torres. Nicole Tsai. Nina
Peng. Olivia Sebade. Paolo Sozzi. Patrick Chin. Patrick
York. Paul Doran. Paul Hinton. Prakazrel Michel. Priya
Patel. Qiang Guo, also known as Mileson. Qidong Xia, also
known as "Long Island David." Rachel Campbell. Rachel



Cartwright. Ray Dragon. Robert Stout. Robin Mokhtar. Ross
Heinemeyer.
Anybody know those individuals or have relatives or
close friends who have dealings with those individuals?
I continue: Ruizheng An, also known as Ryan and
"Crab." Russell Stockil. Ryan Sears. Sam Roberts. Sara Wei.
Scott Barnett. Shamel Medrano. Simon Je. Sophia Chen.
Steele Schottenheimer. Steve Bannon. Steve Weber. Tedroy
Wilson. Tom Bishop. Tom O'Leary. Una Wilkinson. Victor
Cerda. William Kumpf. Xiaobo He. Xiaoke Min.
Do any of you know those individuals or have relatives
or close friends who have dealings with them?
More names: Ya Li. Yanping (Yvette) Wang. Yanping
Liu. Yi Shing Lee. YinYang Wang, also known as Aila.
Yongbing Zhang. Zachary Effting. Zhaoying Ye. And Zhengqiao
Du.
Anyone know these individuals or have relatives or
close friends who have dealings with those people?
The witnesses in this case may include one or more of
what is known as an accomplice or cooperating witness, a person
who has admitted to participating in crimes related to the
indictment, as well as other crimes. Is there anything about
the fact that cooperating witnesses may testify in this case
that would prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror?
I'm now going to read the names of potential



businesses or entities that may be mentioned during the trial:
ACA Capital. Armanino. Bank of Princeton. Bitgo,
Brioni. Dallas Lamborghini. Eastern Profit. Ferrari Beverly
Hills. Freedom Media Ventures. G Bank. G Coins. G Clubs. G
Fashion. G Mall. G Media. G Music. G News. Gettr. Golden
Spring. Greenwich Land.
Do you or family members or close friends have
dealings with these entities?
Okay. What is your number?
JUROR: (106) It's Giter, G-I-T-E-R?
THE COURT: No. G-E-T-T-R. So you don't have any
relationship to that? Okay. I'm going to go forward with——oh.
JUROR: Juror 144. Bitgo.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
I want to go through some other names of entities.
GTV. H Coin. Hamilton Investment. Hayman Capital.
HCHK Property Management. HCHK Technologies. Himalaya
Exchange. Himalaya Farm Alliance. HR Owen. Hudson Diamond.
Jovial Century. Jumio. Maywind. MBaer Bank. Mercantile
Bank. Mountains of Spices. New Federal State of China.
NexBank. OSC/Orbit Service Company.
If you have already spoken to me at the sidebar about
any of these entities, you need not answer now. So anybody
know these entities or have family members or close friends who
have dealt with these entities?



I'm going to go further down the list.
Passione Rossa. Phaxis. Post Oak Motors.
Promemoria. RH Southeby's, spelled S-O-U-T-H-E-B-Y apostrophe
S. Rule of Law Foundation. Rule of Law Society. Strategic
Vision. Taurus Management. Voice of Guo. Voice of Good.
Anyone know these entities or have family members or
close friends who have dealt with them?
JUROR: Can you please confirm that you said
Sotheby's?
THE COURT: Well, this is not spelled the same way as
Sotheby's. Sotheby's does not have a U. This is called RH and
S-O-U-T-H-E-B-Y apostrophe S. My understanding is that
Sotheby's does not have a U. If anybody wants to correct me,
that would be fine.
Yes. Okay. So——
JUROR: Okay. It's the other Sotheby's. Never mind.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty. I'm going to continue
with another list. And this is a list of locations where
events in this case took place.
188 East 64th Street in Manhattan.
19 Houhai Beiyan, Xicheng District, Beijing, People's
Republic of China.
20 South Bay Road, Repulse Bay, Hong Kong.
3 Columbus Circle, New York, New York.
373 Taconic Road, Greenwich, Connecticut.



The Crocker Mansion, 675 Ramapo Valley Road, Mahwah,
New Jersey.
Pangu 7 Star Hotel, Beijing, Chaoyang, Beijing,
People's Republic of China.
Sherry-Netherland, 781 Fifth Avenue, Apartment 1801,
in Manhattan.
Are any of you familiar with these locations?
Your number?
JUROR: 108. My father works at the Sherry-Netherland
Hotel.
THE COURT: Okay. What is his job there?
JUROR: He's a houseman.
THE COURT: And has your father brought up anything
having to do with this case?
JUROR: Not to my knowledge, no.
THE COURT: All right. Counsel, would you approach,
please.
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: Are there any further questions you would
like me to ask?
MR. KAMARAJU: I think it would be helpful to know the
period of her father's employment.
THE COURT: Let's assume that he was employed during
the time in question. Anything further?
MR. SCHIRICK: Whether she's aware of the fire, maybe;



whether she heard from her father about the fire.
MR. FINKEL: The fire is not going to be evidence.
THE COURT: The fire is not coming in.
MS. SHROFF: I understand. I was more interested in
hearing about whether or not her father had ever expressed any
views of the tenants at Sherry-Netherland, you know, that's
all, because it could——one could be left with a bias if
somebody, you know, like the other gentleman who came forward
and said——
THE COURT: He doesn't like rich people.
MR. KAMARAJU: Or she may not know him by the name
Miles Guo.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, if I may, maybe just the
question, have you heard anything from him about the defendant,
Miles Guo, and if the answer is no——
MS. SHROFF: That doesn't cover the bias.
MR. KAMARAJU: She may not know him by the name Miles
Guo. Her father may have said, like, there's a rich Chinese
tenant——
THE COURT: Was he a tenant or did he own that?
MR. KAMARAJU: Well, his family owned it.
MS. MURRAY: It's a hotel and it's a condominium
complex.
THE COURT: So it's not a rental.
MR. KAMARAJU: No.



THE COURT: All right. Let's have her come up.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. You're No. 108.
JUROR: That's correct.
THE COURT: Has your father made comments to you about
the people who live at the hotel, rather, the condominium
section of the hotel?
JUROR: Yes, I'm aware of certain tenants that occupy
the building, or rather own floors in the building, now that
that is something that is allowed.
THE COURT: Has he mentioned Miles Guo?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Has he mentioned a Mr. Kwok?
JUROR: Correct, yes, he has.
THE COURT: And what has he said?
JUROR: That he tried to burn the floor down, if I may
be so frank.
THE COURT: Okay. All right then. You may step back.
JUROR: Sure.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Okay. Well, I think she needs to be
dismissed for cause.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.



(In open court)
THE COURT: Anyone else?
JUROR: Juror 199. 3 Columbus Circle.
THE COURT: I'm sorry. There you are. And what is
your relationship to that location?
JUROR: I worked at that building.
THE COURT: In what capacity?
JUROR: My company had an office there.
THE COURT: And during what period of time?
JUROR: 2020-2023.
THE COURT: 2020-2023?
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: What is the defendant's relationship to
that location?
MS. MURRAY: So the defendant moved the operations of
various entities from the townhouse on the Upper East Side to 3
Columbus Circle. They operated on two different floors. It
would be family offices, Gettr, HCHK, a number of the other
entities named as members of the conspiracy. It's a very large
conference building right off the Time Warner. We'd be
interested to know what company she works for and whether she
had any dealings with any of those floors or any of those
entities.
THE COURT: What floors are those?
MS. MURRAY: I believe they're 20 and 22.



THE COURT: Okay.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 199.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what floor was your company on?
JUROR: 5.
THE COURT: On 5. And did you have any dealings with
the companies on floors 20 and 22?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Were you familiar with any of the names of
the entities, companies that I mentioned in the long list?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
MS. SHROFF: That's fine.
THE COURT: Yeah, I don't see any reason to dismiss
her.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Do any of you know or have any of you or a
member of your family or close friends had any association or
business dealings with any member of the staff of the United
States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and



Exchange Commission, or the SEC, or the Department of Homeland
Security?
For those of you who have already informed me of
relationships with any of those governmental entities, you need
not tell me again.
JUROR: Juror 203. This pertains to the previous
question. I just——I work at 1 Columbus Circle, and I know of
that area.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
JUROR: 151. My cousin's husband works for the FBI.
THE COURT: I'm sorry. You're 151 and your——
JUROR: And my cousin's husband works for the FBI.
THE COURT: Your cousin's husband works for the FBI.
Are you close to your cousin?
JUROR: Pretty much, yeah.
THE COURT: Are you close to her husband?
JUROR: Somewhat. Not as close as I am to her.
THE COURT: All right. Thank you for letting me know.
JUROR: No problem.
THE COURT: Remember, if you've already answered the
question, please don't answer again.
Go ahead.
JUROR: 162. I work for the Securities and Exchange
Commission. I put that on the form, but I'm not sure whether
that got to you or not.



THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
JUROR: Juror 141. A good friend of mine used to run
the——he was the head prosecutor for the U.S. Southern District
of New York.
THE COURT: All right. Who's next?
JUROR: Hi. I am currently the coordinator for——160.
I'm currently the coordinator for County of Rockland, and I
have tried several District——US District Court cases, civil
cases, with the U.S. Attorney's Office.
THE COURT: Thank you.
Anyone else?
JUROR: 127. My brother was an enforcement attorney
at the SEC.
THE COURT: Thank you.
Anyone else?
JUROR: 194. My daughter worked for Homeland
Security.
THE COURT: Did you say 134?
JUROR: 194.
THE COURT: 194. Okay. Thank you.
Anyone else?
JUROR: 154. My boyfriend works for Homeland
Security.
MS. SHROFF: I'm sorry. I didn't hear that.
THE COURT: 154 says that her boyfriend works for



Homeland Security.
Thanks for telling me.
JUROR: 108. I work for the Department of Homeland
Security.
THE COURT: All right. Thank you.
Have you or a family member——I'm sorry? Oh, one more?
JUROR: 149. Former relationship with a special
agent.
THE COURT: All righty. Thank you.
Have you or a family member or close friend ever been
employed by any federal, state, or local law enforcement agency
or the justice system? Only answer to the extent that you have
not answered that question already.
What number are you?
JUROR: 125.
THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.
JUROR: May I approach instead of——
THE COURT: Yes, you may.
(At the sidebar; juror present)
THE COURT: Your number again?
JUROR: 125.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: Yeah. I apologize if I missed the opportunity
on a form, 'cause this goes to this area. My dad's a retired
judge.



THE COURT: And where did he work?
JUROR: Bronx. He was a New York State Supreme Court
justice.
THE COURT: What's his name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: Yes. Absolutely.
Is there anything about your father's career or his
work that would prevent you from being a fair and impartial
juror?
JUROR: I believe I'm kind of biased toward justice,
that if something gets to the point of trial, it's——takes a lot
of work and effort to get there, so I'm——and I've been told by
friends that I tend to be biased, you know, towards the side
of——
THE COURT: In what regard?
JUROR: ——justice.
THE COURT: Yes. I think we all like justice. But
you're saying you're biased in favor of one party here or the
other?
JUROR: No particular party, but just in general, my
tendency is to err on the side——like, if somebody got to the
point of trial, they most likely are guilty.
THE COURT: You're saying that if someone's been
accused of a crime, you think they are guilty, most likely.
JUROR: That's——that's how I feel. That's what



friends have told me.
THE COURT: And so you have a bias against the
defendant in that case then.
JUROR: I may—— that may——may be, you know, conscious,
subconscious, but that's what I——what I've been told.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Oh, if I may, I also have several family
members that work in the court system. If that has any impact.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Okay.
MS. SHROFF: I guess it's if the barbells didn't do
it, I guess——
THE COURT: This is 125?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. Who else?
(Next juror present)
JUROR: My son is NYPD. He's a cop.
THE COURT: Thank you very much. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 138.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: My niece is an FBI agent.
THE COURT: And is there anything about her work that



would prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror in this
case?
JUROR: We don't discuss her work.
THE COURT: So if we have people who work for the FBI
as witnesses, can you judge their testimony in the same way
that you would judge any other person's testimony?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And do you think that you would believe
that it's more likely that they would tell the truth?
JUROR: I would hear what they have to say and make a
judgment based on what they say.
THE COURT: All right. So you don't feel that you
have a bias in favor——
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: ——of law enforcement.
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Do you have a bias against law
enforcement?
JUROR: Not at all.
THE COURT: Okay, then. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: That's it?
(In open court)
THE COURT: Have you or a family member, either
individually or in the course of business, ever been party to



any legal action or dispute with the United States or with any
of the offices, departments, agencies, or employees of the
United States, or had any interest in any such legal action or
dispute or its outcome?
JUROR: Juror 179. I have a bit of a situation with
the Department of Social Services in Rockland County.
THE COURT: All righty. Thank you.
Anyone else?
JUROR: Juror 189. I had a, in Rockland
County——what's it called——I got a fine for doing some handiwork
without a license. Construction.
THE COURT: So how was that resolved?
JUROR: I just paid a fine.
THE COURT: Do you know what agency that was that you
were dealing with?
JUROR: Rockland County.
THE COURT: In other words, was it the Department of
Buildings?
JUROR: Buildings.
THE COURT: And did you feel that they treated you
fairly?
JUROR: Yeah, I guess so. I don't know——I don't know
the procedures really, so I think so. I'm not sure. Yeah, I
guess so. I'm here today.
THE COURT: Well, sometimes when we have a dealing



with the government, we might feel that we're not being treated
fairly, and so that's what I'm trying to get at. Do you feel
that you were treated fairly?
JUROR: I think so, yeah.
THE COURT: Would that experience that you had with
them cause you to have a bias in favor of the government in
this case?
JUROR: I don't——I'm not sure. I don't know.
Probably.
THE COURT: Okay. Anybody else?
Your number again, sir?
JUROR: 189.
THE COURT: 189.
Does anyone have any bias, prejudice, or other strong
feelings for or against the United States Department of
Justice, United States Attorney's Office, or any law
enforcement agency?
Your number, sir?
JUROR: 179.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: I just believe justice is a fallacy.
THE COURT: All right. Anybody else?
JUROR: Juror 159. My sister-in-law is a public
defender so that's impacted my view of the justice system.
THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead. Anybody else?



Have any of you read, heard, or seen anything in the
newspapers or on the internet or on TV about this case?
And I'm only asking about those who have not already
answered this question.
I'd like you to step up, please.
(At the sidebar; juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 127.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
JUROR: I'm sorry?
THE COURT: You may step back.
JUROR: Okay, thanks.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What's your number?
JUROR: 121.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What's your number?
JUROR: 129.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What's your number?
JUROR: 143.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)



THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 151.
THE COURT: 151? You may step back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number, sir?
JUROR: 159.
THE COURT: You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 166.
THE COURT: Okay. And so what is it that you'd like
to tell me?
JUROR: Oh, I first became aware of the defendant——I
first became aware of the defendant when actually Steve Bannon
was arrested. I think he was on his boat. And then I've just
kind of been following that and seeing that this was coming to
trial.
THE COURT: So it's normal that you would read the
newspaper or——
JUROR: Sure.
THE COURT: ——listen to the TV, and this has gotten
media attention, and so the question becomes then, can you put
aside what you've already heard and come into the courtroom



with an open mind, hear the witness testimony, look at the
evidence, the documentary evidence, and follow my instructions
on the law and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: I would say yes normally, but the tie of Steve
Bannon just for me, and then that further tie onto the former
president, I feel like any strong connections like that
make——I'm very distrustful of those individuals, so I don't
know that I could be impartial.
THE COURT: So everyone comes to this courtroom with
biases. I have biases. But I have to put them aside in order
to——
JUROR: I will do my best.
THE COURT: Well, I need to know more than that. I
want to know whether, being aware of the biases that you
already expressed, can you come in, put the biases aside, and
listen to what the witnesses have to say, read the documents
that are put into evidence, follow my instructions on the law,
and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: What number was that?
MS. SHROFF: 166.
THE COURT: She was rehabilitated.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, may we just make a record on



why she should be excused for cause.
THE COURT: Go right ahead.
MS. SHROFF: And I think partially we just want to
make sure that the Court is aware, because I think there is
some degree of concern on our part that because the Court
doesn't have before it exactly the evidence the government is
going to introduce about Mr. Bannon, we'd like the Court to
just note, this is one of the government's exhibits. It's
going to be testified to in the summary chart. And it is not
just Steve Bannon and Mr. Guo and their relationship. They're
in a relationship where they jointly announce a million
dollars' worth of a transaction, and we have a person who has
now said that she did not know "if I can be impartial," she
could normally but she would not because, two reasons——the tie
to Steve Bannon and the former president. I know the Court
said that everybody has a bias and then she had a long shrug
and then she said she would try. So I think that——
THE COURT: So what question would you like me to put
to her?
MS. SHROFF: I think the question at the very least
that should be put to her is, if she heard testimony that Steve
Bannon and Miles Guo were in a joint venture and Mr. Bannon and
Mr. Guo shared a personal friendship, would she still be able
to evaluate Steve Bannon-related testimony fairly, would that
in any way improperly impact her decision-making? Because



here's the concern we've had——and I think we were planning to
raise this down the road with Nos. 11 and 15——that it's not a
business relationship. It's not simply a business
relationship. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have a business
relationship. There's also a trust, a sort of like——it's much
more; it's almost like a partnership, right? The two of them
are walking in tandem. Kamala Harris is never going to say
anything negative about Joe Biden or the other way. They have
each other's back. That's the level of the relationship. He
was arrested on that person's boat, that the testimony is he's
been on that boat for weeks. The government is going to ask
them to draw the conclusion that these two men are tight.
They're co-conspirators. Not just co-conspirators, but they
have a relationship so deep that one would speak for the other.
It goes beyond what the government is just sort of saying, it's
a business relationship. That's not how the evidence is going
to come in.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, if I may.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. FINKEL: Miles Guo is on trial, not Steve Bannon.
I think the question that your Honor asked to the juror was an
appropriate one, which is, understanding everyone enters this
courtroom with some preconceived notions and some biases, can
you put those to the side and evaluate the evidence in this
trial, and she said yes. I would have no objection——the



government would have no objection to your Honor inquiring
about whether her knowledge of Steve Bannon would bias her
against the defendant. If she answered yes to that question,
the government would probably agree that she should be struck
for cause. But seeing a negative answer to that question,
there should not be a strike for cause. Of course she'd be
subject to peremptory challenges.
MS. SHROFF: She should be stricken for cause. She
literally just said the thing that would topple her the most
is——she literally said, in a normal circumstance, I would be
able to put it aside. The tie to Steve Bannon, that——those
were her words, the tie to Steve Bannon. And here, the
government——Mr. Bannon is on trial because they've argued that
he's a co-conspirator and those two acted in tandem. That is
why they're trying to get in his statement and all of the other
co-conspirator statements, right?
THE COURT: So what if I were to ask her that if Steve
Bannon is an unindicted co-conspirator, would that cause her to
have a bias against Mr. Guo?
MS. SHROFF: That would be a fair question, as long as
she understands what an unindicted co-conspirator is. If you
can tell her the allegations here are that Mr. Guo and
Mr. Bannon worked hand in hand, according to the government,
could you still be fair to Mr. Guo, that would be an okay
question.



THE COURT: All right.
MR. FINKEL: Whether she could put whatever biases she
has to the side.
MS. SHROFF: The question——
MR. FINKEL: Excuse me, Ms. Shroff.
THE COURT: One moment. One moment.
Go ahead.
MR. FINKEL: All I was saying is that the question is
whether, ultimately, anyone can put away what they know about
and learned about outside the courtroom and evaluate what's in
the courtroom, following your Honor's instructions, and if a
juror can do that, she shouldn't be struck for cause.
MS. SHROFF: It's not a question of bias and common
sense from the outside, right? What you're saying is, Bannon
is untrustworthy, so Miles Guo is untrustworthy. Bannon is
making a promise that you cannot rely on because you have
negative opinions of Bannon, and where Bannon goes, Guo goes.
So in essence, you are asking for her to distinguish between
the two. If you accept that the two are close, would you then
be able to evaluate and give a fair verdict to Guo because of
the feelings towards Bannon?
(Juror present)
THE COURT: You have said that you have negative
feelings about Steve Bannon.
JUROR: Yes.



THE COURT: The prosecution alleges that Mr. Bannon
conspired with Mr. Guo to commit crimes. Would you be able to
put aside your feelings about Mr. Bannon and be fair and
impartial as a juror to Mr. Guo?
JUROR: I guess the best I can answer to that is I
don't know.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
MS. SHROFF: We challenge for cause.
THE COURT: All right.
MR. KAMARAJU: In case it wasn't obvious.
MR. FINKEL: For the record, no objection from the
government.
THE COURT: What number was that?
MS. SHROFF: 166.
THE COURT: I hope we can get a jury.
MR. FINKEL: It's kind of close.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What number are you?
JUROR: 176.
THE COURT: All righty. You can step back.
Was that it? Okay.
(In open court)
THE COURT: This trial will likely generate media
attention. Will each of you follow my instruction that you



should absolutely avoid reading, watching, or listening to
media reports concerning the case, including coverage of the
case on social media like Facebook, Twitter, blogs, etc., until
after the case is over? Can you all promise that to me?
THE JURORS: Yes.
THE COURT: Is there anybody who cannot follow that
instruction?
Will each of you follow my instruction that you may
not research or talk about the case with other people until the
case is over?
THE JURORS: Yes.
THE COURT: Is there anyone who cannot follow that
instruction, or will not follow that instruction?
As I mentioned, during the trial, you will hear
evidence concerning an alleged racketeering conspiracy
involving wire fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud, and money
laundering. Will the nature of the charges affect your ability
to render a fair verdict?
Have you or anyone else close to you been involved in
any proceeding involving United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, or the SEC?
If you have already answered this question, please do
not answer again.
Have you or anyone close to you ever filed for
bankruptcy or been involved in a bankruptcy proceeding?



JUROR: I had to declare personal bankruptcy——oh,
sorry. 111.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: Yes. I had to declare bankruptcy, personal
bankruptcy, over 20 years ago.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
JUROR: 204. I filed for bankruptcy.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step up.
(At the sidebar; juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. Are you No. 204?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: What's your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And when is it that you applied for
bankruptcy?
JUROR: Applied or when it happened?
THE COURT: Both.
JUROR: Okay. 2024——about five years ago.
THE COURT: And is the bankruptcy case concluded?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: If you hear anything concerning bankruptcy
in this case, would you be able to put aside your own personal
experience and come into the court with an open mind, listen to
the witness testimony, read the documentary evidence, follow my
instructions on the law, and be a fair and impartial juror?



JUROR: Yeah, sure.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my keeping her?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What number are you?
JUROR: 160.
THE COURT: 160. You may step back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is that it? Okay.
(in open court)
THE COURT: Do you or anyone close to you have any
strong views about the Chinese government or the Chinese
Communist Party?
All right. Step up.
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: What is it that you want me to get at with
this question?
MR. KAMARAJU: I think, like yesterday, if somebody
says they've had contact or knowledge of the Chinese Communist
Party, you can simply ask them, can you put those aside and be
a fair and impartial juror?



(Juror present)
THE COURT: Okay. What number are you?
JUROR: 101.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What number are you, sir?
JUROR: 113.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number, sir?
JUROR: 111.
THE COURT: You may step back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 130.
THE COURT: 130. You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 131.
THE COURT: 131. You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 166.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)



THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 168.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 174.
THE COURT: And what is it that you feel about the
Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party?
JUROR: Well, it's more government. Just geopolitical
aggression.
THE COURT: All right. So can you put aside what you
know about the Chinese government or what you heard about it
and come into the courtroom with an open mind and listen to the
witness testimony, read the documentary evidence, follow my
instructions on the law, and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: I can try to.
THE COURT: What do you mean try? This is a yes or no
question.
JUROR: Can you repeat the question.
THE COURT: Sure. Can you put aside any feelings you
have about the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist
Party——
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: ——and come into the courtroom with an open
mind, listen to the witness testimony, read the documentary



evidence, follow my instructions on the law, and be a fair and
impartial juror?
JUROR: Yes. I mean, if it's yes or no, then yes.
THE COURT: Good. Good. You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What is your number, sir?
JUROR: 179.
THE COURT: No. 179. Okay. Sir, you can step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What's your number?
JUROR: 180.
THE COURT: 180. Okay.
JUROR: As I mentioned earlier, I work in the media
business. I have a global role. Part of my global team sits
in China so I have a lot of deals there, and just in terms of
operationally, operating that media business, a lot of what
happens there is very different than what we face in the rest
of the world and how we have to conform is——there's a heavy
hand based on what we can and can't do, so I would say that I
do have a negative opinion of it, just based on my own
dealings.
THE COURT: So you're talking about censorship, right?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: So can you——
JUROR: I wasn't sure the nature of your question out



there, exactly.
THE COURT: Can you put aside your feeling about the
Chinese government and come into the courtroom with an open
mind, listen to the witnesses testify, read the documentary
evidence, follow my instructions on the law, and be a fair and
impartial juror?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All righty. Step back, please.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What is your number, please?
JUROR: 148.
THE COURT: 148?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What's your number?
JUROR: 121.
THE COURT: And you may step back.
THE LAW CLERK: That's it, Judge.
(In open court)
THE COURT: During the trial you may hear testimony
about or from former senior members of the Trump
administration, including Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro. Do
you have any strong views about advisors to former president



Donald Trump, including Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, that
would prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror?
Please step up.
(At the sidebar; juror present)
JUROR: 101.
THE COURT: And you may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number, sir?
JUROR: 103.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 116.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 117.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 133.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 152.
THE COURT: You may step back.



JUROR: Thank you.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 153.
THE COURT: 153. You may step back.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 156.
THE COURT: 156. You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 166.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 177.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 179.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 174.
THE COURT: All righty. What you would like to tell
me?
JUROR: I just wouldn't believe anything they have to
say.
THE COURT: All right. So if I tell you that they're



not going to actually be witnesses but their names may come
up——the prosecution alleges that Mr. Bannon conspired with the
defendant, Mr. Guo, to commit crimes. And so you have said you
wouldn't believe them, so I assume then you have negative views
about Mr. Bannon; is that correct?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: Okay. So having heard the accusation that
I've just summarized, would your feelings about Mr. Bannon
prevent you from being fair as a juror to Mr. Guo?
JUROR: Likely. To be honest, yeah, I guess so.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: What number was that?
MS. SHROFF: 174.
THE COURT: 174. Okay. He is excused.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Go ahead. What's your number?
JUROR: 143.
THE COURT: 143. You may step back.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 146.
THE COURT: 146. Okay. Go ahead.
JUROR: I'm Democrat, and any Republican——I wouldn't
trust a Trump advisor at all.
THE COURT: So in this case, the prosecution alleges



that Steve Bannon conspired with Mr. Guo to commit crimes. The
question is, can you put aside your feelings for Mr. Bannon,
come into the courtroom with an open mind, listen to the
witnesses in the case, read the documentary evidence, follow my
instructions on the law, and be a fair and impartial juror to
Mr. Guo?
JUROR: I think so, yeah.
THE COURT: What do you mean by "I think so"? It's a
yes or no question.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Yes. Okay. You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What's your number?
JUROR: 154.
THE COURT: 154. You may step back.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What's your number?
JUROR: 180.
THE COURT: 180. Go ahead.
JUROR: Okay. So just, Steve Bannon, I think he
was——I mentioned I was a new-ish American, and I didn't become
a US citizen until after the Trump White House because the
voices like Steve Bannon's relative to immigrants that made me
feel very scared, and even after living in this country for
years and years with a green card, I felt very uncomfortable.



The rhetoric that he put forward was some of the most divisive
and alarming that I've ever seen.
THE COURT: All righty. So if you'll stay with me.
JUROR: All right.
THE COURT: So in this case the prosecution alleges
that Mr. Bannon was a co-conspirator of Mr. Guo, that they
conspired together to commit crimes. Would you be able to put
aside these negative feelings that you have about Mr. Bannon
and come into the court with an open mind, listen to the
witness testimony, read the documentary evidence, follow my
instructions on the law, and be a fair and impartial juror for
Mr. Guo?
JUROR: Look, I'd like to say that I would, and I
would——I would try. My hardest and——I just do have deep,
strong feelings relative to what this person has I think vilely
spread across this country. I don't think he's a good person.
So I would try and not let that taint my opinion in this case.
I understand what you're asking. I'm just being truthful.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: And I think she should be dismissed for
cause.
MR. FINKEL: What her feelings were had nothing to do
with his trustworthiness. It was about immigration. If your



Honor asked her whether she understood that this case has
nothing to do with immigration, whether that impacts her view,
I think that would be appropriate. And for what it's worth,
she said she would try. She didn't hesitate and say no, and
then, well, maybe; she said, yes, I could try. I think it
would be appropriate for further inquiry.
MS. SHROFF: She called him the most vile human being,
vilely spreading rhetoric across the country. Yeah. No.
THE COURT: Vile only about immigration? No. No.
She is struck, No. 180.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: Hi. I'm 181.
THE COURT: 181. You may step back, sir.
JUROR: Okay. Just go back?
THE COURT: Go back to your seat, yes.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there.
JUROR: 182.
THE COURT: Yes. You may step back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 194.
THE COURT: 194. You may step back to your seat.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 197.



THE COURT: 197.

JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. And what did you want to say?
JUROR: Anything spoken by Bannon is going to be
questionable.
THE COURT: So we're not expecting him to be a witness
here. The prosecution alleges that Mr. Bannon was a
co-conspirator of Mr. Guo, that he and Mr. Guo conspired to
commit crimes. So the question is, can you put aside your
negative feelings about Mr. Bannon and come into the courtroom
with an open mind, listen to the witness testimony, read the
documentary evidence, follow my instructions on the law, and be
a fair and impartial juror for Mr. Guo?
JUROR: I'd try.
THE COURT: Well, it's really a yes or no kind of a
question.
JUROR: Okay. Yeah, I guess, yes.
THE COURT: Well, I can't have you guess either.
JUROR: Okay. Yes.
THE COURT: So do you feel that you really don't have
certainty about this?
JUROR: Yeah, it's true.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: He waffled. He was 1?



THE LAW CLERK: 197.

MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, he waffled, but I think he
said yes each time.
THE COURT: The problem is——
MR. FINKEL: You can stop laughing, Ms. Shroff. Thank
you.
THE COURT: His body language, the shrugging of the
shoulders, his kind of a little bit of a back-and-forth of the
head, the tone of his voice, I could tell that he was not
speaking with certainty, and I felt that it was appropriate to
go further.
Go ahead.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: All right. What is your number?
JUROR: 202.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what would you like to say?
JUROR: I was just being transparent because I don't
know if you guys do, like, research on the jurors or anything,
but like social media, I have never had anything good to say
about Steve Bannon or Peter Navarro, but——and I, you know, most
definitely will try to be objective and, you know, listen to
the facts and stuff, but I just didn't want it to cause a
problem later.



THE COURT: All right. So you're saying that you have
heard negative things about those two people.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And so you have a negative impression; am
I correct?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: All right. So in this case the
prosecution alleges that Mr. Bannon and Mr. Guo conspired
together to commit crimes, and my question for you——and this is
a yes or no question——can you come into the courtroom with an
open mind, listen to the witness testimony——Mr. Bannon will not
be a witness——listen to the witness testimony, read the
documentary evidence, following my instructions on the law, and
be a fair and impartial juror for Mr. Guo?
JUROR: Yes. I thought he was a witness. That's why
I was like, ah. That's what I thought the issue was. But yes,
I can definitely——
THE COURT: Well, it may be that statements of
Mr. Bannon may come into evidence.
JUROR: Oh, okay.
THE COURT: Not necessarily that he will be physically
in the courtroom, but things that he may have said may come up.
And so if you hear a quote of something that he said, my
question is, can you put aside any negative impressions and be
a fair and impartial juror?



JUROR: I believe I can.
THE COURT: What do you mean by "I believe"? This is
a yes or no question.
JUROR: Then yes.
THE COURT: And you feel certain about that.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. Step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
MS. SHROFF: Could we just ask him if he heard
testimony from Bannon through a recording or a video——
THE COURT: No.
MS. SHROFF: That's the evidence.
THE COURT: I don't see any need for that. I think
I've gone far enough.
Let's go. Come.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. Your number?
JUROR: 204.
THE COURT: 204. Okay. Go ahead.
JUROR: In regards to?
THE COURT: I had asked a question concerning——
JUROR: Right. Those gentlemen, I don't agree with
any of their policies or their politics, so I would certainly
have a very visceral opinion in regards to their involvement in



this case.
THE COURT: Okay. So you have a negative opinion
about those people, right?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: All right. So in this case, the
prosecution alleges that Mr. Bannon and Mr. Guo conspired
together to commit crimes. So my question for you is, can you
put aside your already-formed negative opinion about Mr. Bannon
and come into the court with an open mind, listen to the
witness testimony, read the documentary evidence, follow my
instructions on the law, and be a fair and impartial juror for
Mr. Guo?
JUROR: I don't think I can. If he's involved with
either one of those individuals, no.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I will excuse her for cause.
That's it. Okay.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Do any of you have any strong views about
cryptocurrency that would prevent you from being a fair and
impartial juror?
All righty. Go ahead. If you'll state your number,
please.



JUROR: 121.

THE COURT: Are you saying that you have strong views
for or against cryptocurrency?
JUROR: Oh, I didn't hear the for or against. I'm in
between.
THE COURT: In between? And do you think that those
feelings would affect your ability to be a fair and impartial
juror?
JUROR: Possibly, yeah.
THE COURT: Okay. And again, your number is?
JUROR: 121.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
Anybody else?
Is it your opinion that the actions charged in the
indictment as I have described them to you should not be crimes
or should not be prosecuted federally?
Have you been involved as a defendant, victim,
witness, or in any other way in any prosecution for fraud or
money laundering?
JUROR: 169. Just to clarify, the question was if I
was a witness in a prosecution?
THE COURT: That's one of the categories, whether you
were a defendant, victim, witness, or in any other way involved
in a prosecution for fraud or money laundering.
JUROR: Yes. I testified in a grand jury proceeding



regarding——
THE COURT: Okay. So that's enough. Thank you.
The defendant is charged with acting with others in
committing the alleged crimes. Some of those other individuals
are not on trial in this case. You may not draw any inference,
favorable or unfavorable, towards the government or the
defendant from that fact. You also may not speculate as to why
other persons are not on trial in this courtroom. Would any of
you have any difficulty following that instruction?
Have you, a family member or close friend ever been
involved or appeared as a witness in any investigation by a
federal or state grand jury or by a congressional or state
legislative committee, licensing authority, or governmental
agency?
And this is posed to the people who have not answered
the question.
Have you, a family member, or close friend ever been
questioned in any matter by a federal, state, or local law
enforcement agency, including the FBI? Again, for those who
have not already answered the question.
JUROR: Juror 121.
THE COURT: You were questioned by law enforcement?
JUROR: A close friend was.
THE COURT: Okay. All right. Thank you.
JUROR: Juror 158. I was interviewed by the SEC as



part of a regular audit of the company that I worked at.
THE COURT: All righty.
JUROR: I was——oh, 134. I was in federal court
proving that my son is my son.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
JUROR: Juror 117. And I was present——I don't know if
I was a minor at the time——but my parents were questioned by
the FBI regarding my brother's application for Peace Corps.
THE COURT: Thank you.
JUROR: 123. I had answered questions of the FBI
about a security clearance.
THE COURT: Thank you.
Have you, a family member or close friend ever been a
witness or a complainant in a hearing or trial, whether state,
local, or federal? If you already have not answered the
question.
JUROR: 187. I was a witness in a murder trial.
THE COURT: So would that——
JUROR: It was in Pennsylvania.
THE COURT: Was that state or federal court?
JUROR: It was state.
THE COURT: And how long ago was that?
JUROR: About four years ago.
THE COURT: Did you say 40?
JUROR: Four.



THE COURT: Four. So is there anything about that
experience, having served as a witness in a Pennsylvania court,
that would prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror in
this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Okay. Anyone else?
JUROR: Juror No. 178. I was a witness in a——I don't
even know what to call it. It was for a friend of mine whose
father molested her, in court.
THE COURT: Oh, okay. Thank you.
Anybody else?
Are you, a member of your family, or a close friend
now under subpoena or, to your knowledge, about to be
subpoenaed in a criminal case?
Have you, a family member or close friend ever been
charged with a crime? And this is for people who have not
answered the question.
Have you, a family member, or close friend ever been
the subject of any investigation or accusation by a grand jury,
federal or state?
Have you, a family member, or close friend ever been
the victim of a crime?
JUROR: Hi again. 119.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: Yeah. I was the victim of an assault.



THE COURT: You were the victim of an assault.
Go ahead, the next person.
JUROR: 179. My father attempted infanticide when I
was a child.
THE COURT: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
Go ahead.
JUROR: 168. Car theft.
THE COURT: You said a car theft, is that it?
JUROR: Car theft.
THE COURT: 168, yes?
JUROR: Yes, 168.
JUROR: 169. My wife was the victim of an identity
theft that was used to conduct unauthorized financial
transactions.
THE COURT: Thank you.
JUROR: 123. I had a bike stolen, and I also had
grand larceny at my work where I had a laptop and some desk
supplies stolen off of it.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: 122. My home was robbed.
THE COURT: Thank you.
JUROR: 153. My sister was murdered.
THE COURT: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
Anyone else?
JUROR: 138. I was a victim of a hate crime.



THE COURT: I'm sorry. Did you say that was 138?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: What happened, sir? Did you want to talk
to us privately?
JUROR: No. It's fine. I'm gay, and I was assaulted.
THE COURT: I'm sorry. Did you say the date?
JUROR: No. I said I'm gay.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: I was assaulted. I fought back. The
perpetrator was caught, but I didn't press charges because he
was a veteran, was suffering from PTSD.
THE COURT: So he was never held accountable for that.
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: And so the fact that you were an innocent
victim and the perpetrator of the crime was never held
accountable, would that make you want to hold Mr. Guo
accountable?
JUROR: Yes, if that is——if he is guilty of the
offense.
THE COURT: Well, I'm saying, would your experience
make you biased against Mr. Guo?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Okay. So can you set aside that terrible
experience of the past and come into the courtroom with an open
mind and listen to the witness testimony and read the



documentary evidence and follow my instructions on the law, and
be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: You can be fair to Mr. Guo; is that
correct?
JUROR: That's correct.
THE COURT: And you can be fair to the government,
yes?
JUROR: Yes, that's correct.
THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.
JUROR: 151. My brother-in-law was murdered.
THE COURT: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
JUROR: 150. I have a couple of——
THE COURT: One second. One second, please.
Go ahead.
JUROR: I have a couple of friends that was victim of
internet——it was through the internet and the people was not
legit.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you for telling me.
JUROR: 149. Car theft and residential burglary.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: 187. I've been robbed at gunpoint on the
street, and I've had my apartment broken into while I was in
it.
THE COURT: And you're 187?



JUROR: 187, yes.
THE COURT: Okay. So the robbery at gunpoint on the
street, did you report that?
JUROR: Yes, I did.
THE COURT: And how long ago was that?
JUROR: That was in the '70s.
THE COURT: And were the police able to find the
perpetrator?
JUROR: They never really tried.
THE COURT: So you were disappointed with the way that
the police behaved back then?
JUROR: Yes, I was.
THE COURT: So would that tend to make you have a bias
against the police?
JUROR: To some extent, yes. I think I would listen
to what the evidence is in this case, but——
THE COURT: So you had a negative experience with the
police, and my question is, considering that there will be law
enforcement witnesses, can you put aside that negative
experience of so many years ago and come into the court with an
open mind, listen to the witness testimony——
JUROR: Unfortunately I've had other——I was also a
juror on a trial of a corrupt policeman, so I have had several
negative experiences with the police.
THE COURT: So are you saying that those negative



experiences would cause you to have a bias against a law
enforcement official?
JUROR: Again, I would certainly try to listen fairly,
but is there some inherent bias? Probably, yes.
THE COURT: So we all come into this courtroom with
biases. I have biases. But the task is, can you set those
biases aside, first be aware of them and then to set them
aside, so that you can be objective about the evidence in this
particular case? Would you agree with me that there are good
police officers?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And do you rely on the police or would you
rely on the police if you felt that you needed them?
JUROR: I have not been able to in the past.
THE COURT: Would you call the police if you felt that
you needed to call the police?
JUROR: I would.
THE COURT: Yes, you would. Okay. So you would agree
that there are some good police and some police that are not
good?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: So can you set aside your negative
attitude and——you're saying that your feelings are founded upon
your personal experiences. And can you set aside those
personal experiences and listen objectively to the evidence in



this case and be fair to both sides?
JUROR: I believe I can.
THE COURT: It's a yes or no question.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And your number again?
JUROR: 187.
THE COURT: Do you feel that you would have any bias
against the government in this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Bias in favor of the government?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Bias against the defendant?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Bias for the defendant.
JUROR: I don't know the defendant.
THE COURT: Okay. So you're saying no, you would not
have a bias in favor of——
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: ——the defendant.
JUROR: Right.
THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.
JUROR: 129. My home was burglarized.
THE COURT: All right. Thank you for telling me.
JUROR: 201. 201, my number. In 2019, in October, I
got a sucker punch in my face in 10:30 p.m. in Manhattan, and



it was a gang, four people——three guys and one young woman, 18
years old. And the police found the woman, and they called me.
I went to police. I was in the hospital, and then I went to
police, and many people asked me different questions. And they
found this girl, and they saw it, everything what happened,
because it was a camera on the street, and they showed me,
because I didn't see. She hit me from the back. So I didn't
see actually. I saw the movie. And she didn't get any
justice, nothing. They said because she was 18 years old,
she's young, this is the first time. And that's the story.
That's it.
THE COURT: Then you were disappointed.
JUROR: Yes, very disappointed.
THE COURT: Okay. Anybody else?
JUROR: 113. I was mauled by a group of teenagers.
The outcome, similar situation. They were given probation
because of their age.
THE COURT: So you were also disappointed.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All righty.
JUROR: Juror 117. My car was broken into, my mother
was mugged, and my father and brother have been held up many
times with a gun and a knife.
THE COURT: Thank you.
That's it?



Okay. Has anyone served on a jury or grand jury, in
federal or state court?
JUROR: Juror 101. It was probably about five or six
years ago. It was a attempted murder and weapons charge, and I
was on the jury.
THE COURT: All right. If you've served in a criminal
case, do not tell me the verdict.
Okay. Thank you.
JUROR: I've served.
THE COURT: What's your number?
JUROR: 105.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: In criminal case, state case.
THE COURT: And what county was that?
JUROR: Westchester, White Plains.
THE COURT: What?
JUROR: White Plains, Westchester.
THE COURT: And without telling me the verdict, did
the jury reach a verdict?
JUROR: We sure did.
THE COURT: And how long did you say that was ago?
JUROR: Last year.
THE COURT: Last year?
JUROR: Last year.
THE COURT: Was that state court?



JUROR: State court.
THE COURT: Okay. Who else?
JUROR: 109. I was on a jury about seven years ago.
THE COURT: All righty. Who else?
JUROR: 111. I served on a state case about 15 to 20
years ago.
THE COURT: Okay. Who else?
JUROR: 119. State civil case, about three years ago.
THE COURT: All righty. Who else?
JUROR: 133. I served here in Manhattan. It was a
grand jury, but it was multiple cases a day for a month.
THE COURT: All righty.
JUROR: 137. I served here about ten years ago.
THE COURT: In this courthouse?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And was it a civil or criminal case?
JUROR: Criminal.
THE COURT: And without telling me the verdict, did
the jury reach a verdict?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: You're saying that there was——
JUROR: They reached a resolution. They pleaded it
out.
THE COURT: Oh, you're saying that you never actually
deliberated?



JUROR: No.
THE COURT: So there was a guilty plea before you had
the opportunity to deliberate; is that it?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And you said that was ten years ago?
JUROR: Probably about ten years ago. It might have
been longer than that.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: 142.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: I served in a criminal case in the Bronx like
15 years ago.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: Juror 144. Served around 2009 or 2010, state.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: 152. I served the state, Rockland County, in
a criminal case, seven years ago.
THE COURT: All righty. Who else?
JUROR: 169. I served on a jury on a criminal case,
state, around 2008. We did reach a verdict.
THE COURT: Okay. Who else?
JUROR: 138. Civil case. We did reach a verdict.
THE COURT: And so was that here in federal court or
state court?
JUROR: State court.



THE COURT: In Manhattan?
JUROR: Manhattan, yes.
THE COURT: And how many years did you say?
JUROR: Probably eight, nine years ago.
THE COURT: Civil matter, and you reached a verdict.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. Who else?
JUROR: 182. State court, criminal, 15 years ago. In
Manhattan state court.
THE COURT: 182?
All righty. Who else?
(Continued on next page)



THE COURT: All righty. Who else?
JUROR: 162. Over ten years ago, Southern District,
civil case, we reached a verdict.
THE COURT: Who else?
JUROR: 175. I served on the grand jury for a month.
THE COURT: Who else?
JUROR: 187. I served on all state grand jury twice.
THE COURT: Where?
JUROR: Criminal, reached a verdict. Civil, that did
not reach a verdict, but settled after a week's deliberation.
And another criminal, I was alternate and deliberated the first
day and then they sent me home.
THE COURT: I just want to take these one at a time.
What county?
JUROR: All in Manhattan.
THE COURT: All in Manhattan.
And the most recent case happened when?
JUROR: More than ten years ago.
THE COURT: And that was a civil or criminal case?
JUROR: That was criminal.
THE COURT: And you reached a verdict?
JUROR: Yes, we did.
THE COURT: And then the next most recent case?
JUROR: That was the civil case where it went on for a
couple of weeks and we deliberated for close to a week and then



they settled.
THE COURT: Okay. And anything else?
JUROR: I was an alternate on another criminal case.
THE COURT: Any other case where you served as a
juror?
JUROR: No. Well, not that I recall at this point.
Nothing -- I think it was settled along the way, but I don't
recall deliberating.
THE COURT: Anyone else?
JUROR: 193. A state court, Manhattan. It was a
civil case.
THE COURT: And how long ago was that?
JUROR: It was six or seven years ago.
THE COURT: Go ahead. Who's next?
JUROR: 192. I served as a jury about eleven years
ago here in this building. It was a criminal trial. We did
reach a verdict.
THE COURT: All righty. Who else?
JUROR: 197. Criminal in the Bronx in 2018. But
after it was finished, the lawyers approached us and revealed
that there was information that wasn't revealed to us that
would have changed our mind about the entire process.
THE COURT: And you're 197, did you say?
JUROR: 197.
THE COURT: Okay. Who else?



JUROR: 202.

THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: I had a civil, state, and I was a juror up in
Putnam County.
THE COURT: And how long ago was that?
JUROR: 2019.
THE COURT: Who else?
That was a state matter?
JUROR: Yes. State. Sorry.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: 199.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: Over ten years ago I was on a jury. State,
criminal.
THE COURT: What county was that?
JUROR: Manhattan.
THE COURT: And did you reach a verdict?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Anyone else?
JUROR: Juror No. 200.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: A criminal case in Brooklyn about nine years
ago.
THE COURT: Anyone else?
JUROR: 204. I was a grand jury juror in 2001. White



Plains, New York, 2007. And again in 2009 in White Plains, New
York.
THE COURT: Thank you. Anyone else?
The government witnesses in this case will include
agents and analysts from the FBI. This question is addressed
to those of you who have not already answered the question.
Would any of you be more or less likely to believe a
witness merely because he is a law -- he or she is a law
enforcement officer?
Some of the evidence admitted at trial may come from
searches performed by law enforcement officers. I instruct you
that those searches were legal and that the evidence obtained
from those searches is admissible in this case.
Do any of you have strong feelings about searches
conducted by law enforcement officers or the use of evidence
obtained from searches that would interfere with your ability
to be fair and impartial as a juror in this case?
Does anyone have any expectations about the types of
evidence that the government or the defendant should or will
present in this criminal trial or in a criminal trial more
generally?
Would any of you be unable to follow the Court's
instructions that the government is not required to use any
particular technique in order to investigate evidence of a
crime?



Under our system of law, the jury determines the facts
and the Court determines the law. These two areas are separate
and distinct. At the end of the case, I will instruct you on
the law. You are required to accept the law as I explain it to
you. It will be your job to determine the facts subject to my
explanation of the law. You may not substitute your notions of
what the law is or what you think it should be.
Is there anyone who feels that he or she is either
unwilling or unable to apply the law as I explain it to you?
Under our system of law, every defendant is presumed
innocent and cannot be found guilty unless a jury, having heard
all the evidence in the case, unanimously decides that the
evidence proves his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
Is there anyone who has difficulty accepting the law
or the presumption of innocence as to the defendant?
Under our system of law the burden of proof is on the
government. The burden never shifts. The defendant does not
have to prove his innocence, present any evidence, testify, or
cross-examine any of the government's witnesses. If the
defendant chooses not to testify, you cannot hold that against
him. Is there any juror who cannot follow that instruction?
Conversely, if defense counsel decides to put on a
case on defendant's behalf, that fact does not shift the burden
of proof to the defendant, nor does it diminish the obligation
of the government to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a



reasonable doubt. Would anyone have any difficulty following
this principle?
The law provides that only the evidence produced here
in court may be used by you to determine whether the government
has met its burden of proving the defendant's guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt. You may not consider any outside facts
beyond the trial evidence. Is there anyone who has difficulty
accepting that law?
The law provides that the question of punishment is
for the judge alone. The question of the possible sentence
that the defendant may face cannot enter into your
deliberations as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
Is there any juror who cannot follow that instruction?
If the evidence establishes the defendant's guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt, is there anyone who feels that they
could not render a verdict of guilty?
If the evidence does not establish the defendant's
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, is there anyone who feels that
they could not render a verdict of not guilty?
Aside from the attorneys who have already identified
themselves, do any of you have any legal training, is there any
reason that this would prevent you from applying the law as I
instruct you, without regard for what you may think the law is
from outside training or experience?
Does anyone have any religious, philosophical, or



other beliefs that would make him or her unable to render a
verdict?

JUROR: I said I was a Ph.D. dropout. I went on, but
didn't complete the degree.
THE COURT: I understand. But you did get the
master's?
JUROR: Yes, I got a master's.
THE COURT: And so what was your --
JUROR: That was romance languages.
THE COURT: Romance languages. Which of the romance
languages?
JUROR: Primarily Spanish, but French and Portuguese.
THE COURT: And what is your job?
JUROR: I'm retired.
THE COURT: And what did you used to do?
JUROR: IT. Nothing to do with languages.
THE COURT: Are you married or in a significant
relationship?
JUROR: Single.
THE COURT: What do the members of your household do
for a living, if you have any other adults in your house?
JUROR: There is no one else.
THE COURT: Do you like any type of reading?
JUROR: After The New York Times , I read mostly
fiction and some music magazines.



THE COURT: Clubs or organizations?
JUROR: None.
THE COURT: How do you spend your spare time?
JUROR: Go to a lot of theater, concerts, movies, and
eating.
THE COURT: Is there anything that would prevent you
from being a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: No. 188.
JUROR: From Manhattan, Hell's Kitchen.
THE COURT: Okay. You've been there for the last five
years?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: How far did you go in school?
JUROR: A bachelor's degree.
THE COURT: In what subject?
JUROR: Psychology.
THE COURT: Your current job?
JUROR: Case manager for housing.
THE COURT: Case manager for housing did you say?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Are you married or in a significant
relationship?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Are there any other adults in your home



who work?
JUROR: Yes, my mom.
THE COURT: What does she do?
JUROR: Inspection for a company for jewelry.
THE COURT: Do you like any type of reading?
JUROR: No. I like social media.
THE COURT: And any particular type of social media?
JUROR: All of them. Instagram -- Instagram,
Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok.
THE COURT: How do you spend your spare time?
JUROR: With my family.
THE COURT: Is there anything that would prevent you
from being a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: My sister is part of the NYPD, so a little bit
of bias, but --
THE COURT: So what is it that she does for the NYPD?
JUROR: She's a police officer.
THE COURT: So what do you mean a little bit of bias?
JUROR: I just feel that sometimes they are mistreated
in their job. They work too many hours. They are pushed
beyond their limits a lot. So I just feel that like the
government job itself, they should be like less enforced on
them.
THE COURT: So I agree that government jobs should not
be as trying and that the salary should be higher.



So your sister has decided to do a very difficult job.
And she puts herself at risk in order to help her community,
and so that is noble. And sometimes people don't appreciate
that. Sometimes people can be rude or even abusive towards
police officers.
But then there are those people who have deep
appreciation for the police and who don't do anything that
would be harmful or offensive towards the police. Would you
agree with me on that?
JUROR: I guess so. But I guess more recently we've
seen cases like when the police officers are abusing, I guess,
civilians. And I guess people take that thinking that the
police officers don't do their job well. And they think that
they're all one person, I'd say.
THE COURT: So you're saying that there are some
incidents that have gotten a lot of media attention where a bad
cop is doing bad things, and then people sometimes will
generalize about all other cops, is that what you're saying?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. Yeah, sometimes that does happen,
that people generalize and stereotype. But there are those who
appreciate that there are police officers who are competent and
do their jobs with integrity; is that right?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. So there will be law enforcement



witnesses in this case. And my question for you is can you
evaluate their testimony in the same way that you would
evaluate any other person's testimony?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: So what I mean by that is would you have a
bias in favor of a law enforcement witness?
JUROR: I don't think so, no.
THE COURT: So it does call for a yes or no answer.
Do you feel certain that you would not have a bias in
favor of a law enforcement witness?
JUROR: Not 100 percent, I would say.
THE COURT: Okay. All right. Thank you for your
candor.
Counsel, if you'll approach.
(At sidebar)
MR. KAMARAJU: Sorry.
THE COURT: No, no, no. I asked you to tell me. So
why don't we just knock out the remaining five, even if we end
up going past 5.
MR. KAMARAJU: We knock out the five individual
questions.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: And then come back.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. FINKEL: Do peremptories after --



MR. KAMARAJU: We need time.
MS. SHROFF: We can't do that.
MR. FINKEL: I'm just saying, the government simply is
able to do peremptories after the jury leaves, if it's
convenient for the Court and its staff.
THE COURT: So my only concern is the marshals.
Because they have a particular routine in getting the
defendants back. And so I have to make an inquiry about that.
But I don't mind remaining in order for us to get this done.
MR. FINKEL: Of course.
THE COURT: Let's see what happens.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, it's hard for us to confer
with him and also to get him back and not have Mr. Guo sit in
the holding pens for hours at a time because he misses the bus.
So that's my concern.
THE COURT: Where do you confer with him?
MS. SHROFF: Well, this morning, your Honor, I was
here by quarter to nine, and I conferred with him in the
morning.
THE COURT: In the pen here?
MS. SHROFF: Yes, I did.
THE COURT: Okay.
MS. SHROFF: And I think I was the first one here.
And I spent the time trying to figure out which ones he had
made notations about. And we would ask for that same



opportunity. That's what happened yesterday.
THE COURT: What I'm saying is it's possible that I
might give you that opportunity after we finish today, but I
have to find out from the marshals whether or not that would
interfere with their schedule.
MS. SHROFF: Okay.
THE COURT: So I will let you know.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, your Honor.
(In open court)

from being a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: Unless it goes against my religion, then no.
If something could happen, I don't know what the case is fully



about.
THE COURT: So in this case, the only laws that you
can consider are the laws of the United States government. And
so you could not consider any religious laws. Would you be
able to set aside religious laws and follow my instructions on
the law?

JUROR: Trying to heal from the injuries that I got,
work-related injuries.
THE COURT: And the injuries that you have, is that
going to have any impact on your ability to be a fair and
impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No, it's not. As a matter of fact, because of
the injuries, I have just some workers' compensation cases
myself pro se , and won some cases, so I respect the law.
THE COURT: I'm just saying, physically, is there



anything about your physical condition that would interfere
with your ability to be a juror?

(At sidebar)
THE COURT: So there are a couple of people I believe
who need to be stricken for cause: No. 188, do you both agree?
MS. SHROFF: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay. So No. 188, dismissed.
Is there anybody else?
MS. MURRAY: 189.
MS. SHROFF: I have 189.
THE COURT: Yes. You both agree that he should be
stricken?
MS. SHROFF: Yes.
MS. MURRAY: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay. So he's dismissed.
Is there anyone else?
MS. MURRAY: 202 was not yet stricken, that was the
last juror.
THE LAW CLERK: And 14.
THE COURT: Wait a minute. Remind me why 202 should
be stricken.
MS. MURRAY: We haven't inquired individually.
THE COURT: You're saying I forgot to talk to 202?
MS. MURRAY: Yes.
MS. SHROFF: And 14. 14 is the leftover who came
late.
THE COURT: Where is 14?



THE LAW CLERK: I believe he's in the back.
MR. FINKEL: Is 14 now 205?
THE LAW CLERK: He's technically No. 14.
THE COURT: He remains 14.
MR. FINKEL: With respect to --
THE COURT: Yes, with respect to his order, when we
are doing the strikes, he is now at the very end.
MR. FINKEL: Oh, he's at the end. Okay. Thank you.
THE COURT: Okay. So let me go back and do --
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, may we just have one second?
I just want to see if I had --
(Counsel conferred)
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, may I just double-check a
number with the Court, as 174 being out?
THE COURT: 174 is out.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Okay. Are you No. 163?
JUROR: Yes, I am.
THE COURT: Would you happen to have found out whether
or not you can get more time paid for?
JUROR: I have not found out.
THE COURT: But you can do that overnight and come
back in the morning and tell me?
JUROR: I can send them an email. I can't guarantee



you if they're going to respond in the morning by the time --
before I get here.
THE COURT: Can you tell them that it's urgent and
that the judge has directed you to do that as a matter of law?
JUROR: I can. I can't predict other humans'
behaviors.
THE COURT: All right. Tell the powers that be that
the judge has ordered them to give you that answer.
JUROR: Okay. I will.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Who else?
THE LAW CLERK: 191 is coming forward.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. So did you hear anything further
about the amount of time that you would get paid for jury
service?
JUROR: So no. I mean, I have to do it after this.
THE COURT: Okay. All right. So I want you to make
that inquiry.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: I want you to tell whoever it is, whoever
the powers that be are, that the judge has ordered that they
give you that information immediately.
JUROR: Okay.



THE COURT: Okay? And then tomorrow morning you're
going to come back and let me know.
JUROR: All right. Sounds good.
THE COURT: Thank you.
MS. SHROFF: I'm sorry, what was his number?
THE LAW CLERK: 191.
MS. SHROFF: 191. Okay. Thank you.
THE COURT: Okay. So I'm going to now do 202 and 14.
And the marshals will permit you to stay late with
Mr. Guo?
MS. SHROFF: It's not the marshals. We wanted Mr. Guo
to get back because then he sits in the pen before he goes back
up. So it wasn't whether the marshals would take him back.
But, your Honor, may I just ask a question about the
two jurors that are going to come back with answers tomorrow?
THE COURT: Yeah.
MS. SHROFF: Is that not going to affect how we
choose? If neither of them are going to get paid, were you
planning to excuse them or were they --
THE COURT: We'll discuss it tomorrow.
MS. SHROFF: So --
THE COURT: In other words, if they come back to me
and say we're not going to get paid for the full amount of time
and that would constitute a financial hardship, then I would
excuse them.



MS. SHROFF: Right. So that's the reason why, so that
we're waiting on the answer for those two. It's logical to
exercise our peremptories after we hear from them.
THE COURT: Oh, definitely. Absolutely. So we'll
hear tomorrow.
MR. KAMARAJU: Oh, okay.
MS. SHROFF: That's fine.
MR. KAMARAJU: Sorry, your Honor. We were consulting
with Mr. Guo and then doing peremptories right now.
THE COURT: No.
MS. SHROFF: Okay, okay. Thank you. That's what I
meant. Great. Thank you very much.
MS. MURRAY: I was also going to note that they are in
neither of the next two sets of 12, in any event. So if we had
gone to peremptories tonight, it wouldn't have affected the
next two sets.
THE COURT: Except we have these folks that come up
with excuses.
MS. MURRAY: No, I understand.
MR. KAMARAJU: That's right, your Honor. We don't
know what the morning will bring.
MS. MURRAY: Just doing the numbers.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor. We appreciate
it.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty.

the government?

JUROR: No, I live alone.
THE COURT: Do you like any type of reading, books,
magazines, websites?
JUROR: Well, only book I really read is Bible, the
Bible. That's it. I do other reading, but not as -- not a
reader except for religious, you know, religious.
THE COURT: Do you belong to any clubs or
organizations?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: And how do you spend your spare time?
JUROR: I listen to music and YouTube.
THE COURT: Is there anything that would prevent you
from being a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No, no.

(At sidebar)
THE COURT: I just want to go over those who are being
dismissed: 101, 102, 103, 108, 109, 110 no one showed up, 111,

rest will be coming back tomorrow morning, including the four
that have been here all day from yesterday, we hope.
THE LAW CLERK: I think it's eight.
THE COURT: There are eight? Oh. Eight.
MR. KAMARAJU: Two should be seated, right?
MS. SHROFF: Four that are pending.
THE COURT: We have two that are chosen, but I am not
swearing those.
MR. KAMARAJU: Of course.
THE LAW CLERK: Judge, could I read the list of who's
left?
THE COURT: Okay.
THE LAW CLERK: So this is who we have left: 104,

MR. KAMARAJU: Did you say 190? I'm sorry.
THE LAW CLERK: Yes.
THE COURT: So we're going to now excuse those



individuals who are not coming back tomorrow. And when you
come back tomorrow, we will continue with the peremptory
challenges.
Anything further?
MR. FINKEL: They all come back tomorrow.
THE COURT: Oh, yes, indeed. We really do. Maybe I
should even bring in -- after these leave, maybe I should bring
in those eight and remind them of their obligation to return.
THE LAW CLERK: Everyone should stay seated except for
these people.
THE COURT: Well, you can read the list of those who
are excused.
THE LAW CLERK: Okay.

(Jurors listed above dismissed)
THE COURT: I want to first apologize to the jurors
who have been waiting all day long, the eight of you who
faithfully returned. There were circumstances beyond my
control, and beyond the control of the parties, which caused us
to go a little bit longer than we expected. However, the trial
is going to start tomorrow, and I need for you as well as every
other juror in this room to return at 9 a.m. sharp tomorrow.
It is very important that you get here on time. There are so



many moving pieces in a trial, the lawyers, the defendant, the
witnesses, everyone has got to be on time in order for us to
make this flow properly.
One important rule that you must observe now and
throughout the rest of the trial is that you're not permitted
to discuss the case amongst yourselves or with anybody else.
Don't permit anyone to discuss the case in your presence. And
so I will see everyone tomorrow morning at 9. Have a good
evening.
And everyone is going to 26A. 26A is the room that
you're going to.

THE COURT: What is your number?
THE LAW CLERK: 163.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: So the first question is, was I selected as a
juror, or was I——can you guys narrow it down, or——
THE COURT: We have narrowed it down, but we haven't
finalized it yet, and so you may be selected as a juror.
JUROR: The follow-up question I had was, so I get 30
days of jury time that's compensated. If this case lasted till
July 12th, which is what I think you said, I have to——I have a
firmwide break the week following July 4th, so I'm not sure if
that influences anything.



THE COURT: Oh, you mean that this is essentially a
vacation?
JUROR: Everyone at my firm has the week off following
the week of July 4th. So what——the reason I bring this up is
because I don't think it's going to be a conflict anymore,
assuming the case doesn't go beyond July 12th.
THE COURT: Okay. And do you want to confirm that
then?
JUROR: I can confirm it, yeah. I'd have to let you
know in the morning, if I get a response before I leave to come
here in the morning. Because I have a work laptop, so——
THE COURT: All righty. Good luck with that.
JUROR: I just wanted to let you know.
THE COURT: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
MR. FINKEL: That resolves one logistical difficulty,
because the problem week was the week after July 12th, which
he's going to be off anyway, so in other words, the 30 days, as
I understand it, he's covered.
MS. SHROFF: That's a really shitty way to spend your
one week off from work. I think that's what he was trying to
say.
THE COURT: I just want to make sure that we all agree
that that actually covers the whole time?
MR. FINKEL: Yes.



THE COURT: Okay. All right. Well, he'll come to us
tomorrow morning.
ALL COUNSEL: Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT: Thank you. We're done.
MR. FINKEL: I'm sorry. One thing.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
MR. FINKEL: So I was thinking through the
peremptories tomorrow. So if let's say in the middle, the
second group of 12 peremptories are exercised such that three
of them become in the actual jury and there's whatever, six or
so that are left that weren't struck, do they automatically
become alternates or do you sort of have a new group of 12 at
which point we exercise our alternate peremptories?
THE COURT: So we first get a jury of 12, and then one
by one we consider the alternates, one by one.
MR. FINKEL: Okay.
THE COURT: They're not a group of four or a group of
six. It's one, and then another, and then another.
MR. FINKEL: Consecutively.
THE COURT: Correct.
MR. FINKEL: Okay. Thank you.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. SCHIRICK: Thank you.
