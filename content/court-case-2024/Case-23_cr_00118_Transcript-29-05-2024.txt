(Trial resumed; jury not present)
THE COURT: Good morning.
Please make your appearances.
MR. FINKEL: Good morning, your Honor. Ryan Finkel,
Juliana Murray, Micah Fergenson, and Justin Horton for the
government. We're joined at counsel table by Isabel Loftus,
who's a paralegal in our office.
MR. KAMARAJU: Good morning, your Honor. Sid Kamaraju
and Scott Schirick on behalf of Mr. Guo. And Mr. Guo is with
us here at counsel table.
THE COURT: Please be seated.
On May 27th, 2024, the government submitted a motion
to admit certain exhibits consisting of preserved copies of
online posts to G News and Gettr, ECF No. 352.
Defendant filed opposition papers on May 28th, 2024,
ECF 361.
I've also reviewed the underlying documents the
government seeks to admit, relying principally on Anderson v.
United States , 417 U.S. 211 (1974). The government argues that
it is not offering the posts for the truth of the matters
asserted therein; instead, it states that it is offering the
posts "for the fact that they exist, i.e., that they were made
on media websites created and controlled by the defendant."
I agree with the government that this anticipated use
falls outside the definition of hearsay. In Anderson, the



O5TVGUO

court determined that a statement was not hearsay because it
was not offered to "prove the truth of anything asserted
therein," but "to prove that the statements were made so as to
establish a foundation for later showing through other
admissible evidence that they were false. " Id. at 220.
Further, to the extent that witnesses viewed the posts
at issue, they are admissible as nonhearsay to show their
effect on the viewer. SEC v. AT&T, Inc ., 626 F. Supp. 3d 703,
737 (S.D.N.Y. 2022).
Accordingly, I will not exclude the posts on hearsay
grounds.
I also find that under Federal Rules of Evidence 40 1
and 403, the posts on G News and Gettr, media organizations
that the government alleges were created and controlled by the
defendant, are relevant as proof of the G Enterprise and is
evidence of defendant's scheme to defraud.
Accordingly, the government's motion is granted.
Are there any further applications at this time?
MR. FERGENSON: Not with respect to that, your Honor.
MR. SCHIRICK: No, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, I just wanted to place
something on the record, if I may.
After reviewing yesterday's transcript and with the
Court's comments to counsel in the robing room in mind, which
the government took very seriously and takes very seriously,



O5TVGUO

Ms. Shroff had flagged something for the government yesterday
which I just want to put on the record for the Court.
Yesterday morning, as the Court knows, Ms. Shroff
indicated that she needed more time to review a victim's 3500
material. And I indicated that that victim was originally set
to testify yesterday, but that we would not call her yesterday,
and this would provide the defense with more time to review
that new 3500.
Looking at the transcript, I wasn't clear in that
moment that the decision not to call the victim was made that
morning, just before your Honor took the bench, just before
your Honor called us into the robing room. In any event, the
reordering decision seemed responsive to Ms. Shroff's request
for more time and that's why I raised it.
To the extent I caused any misimpression with your
Honor, with the parties, I certainly apologize for that. I did
not intend to do so. We will continue to work with defense
counsel and continue to take very seriously and follow the
Court's instruction to conduct this trial in an efficient and
responsible manner.
THE COURT: I did not have a negative impression
yesterday morning, and I'm so glad to see that everyone is
working well together.
MR. FINKEL: Me too. Thank you.
MR. FERGENSON: I'm sorry, your Honor.



O5TVGUO

THE COURT: Go ahead.
MR. FERGENSON: I had one related point, another quick
point to put on the record.
We've been working very productively with defense
counsel on a handful of stipulations related to Shamel
Medrano's testimony as a summary witness regarding these G News
and Gettr posts and other videos. We have made video clips of
longer videos.
The defense may seek to offer additional portions of
the longer videos under the rule of completeness. We have
agreed that the government may have substantive objections to
those under the hearsay rules, for example, but we're not going
to object under, you know, timeliness or something like that.
So that the defense has additional time to consider what, if
any, other portions they'd like to offer.
And I just wanted to put that on the record so it's
clear the defense has comfort we're not going to object on that
basis at a later date.
THE COURT: I'm glad to hear that.
MR. FERGENSON: Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT: Is there anything else?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
THE COURT: So I'd like to have the witness back on
the stand by, say, 9:29, so that he is here when the jurors
come in. Thank you.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
MR. FINKEL: Thank you.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
(Recess)
THE COURT: Good morning. Please be seated.
Would you have the jurors brought in.
(Jury present)
THE COURT: Good morning, jurors.
THE JURY: Good morning.
THE COURT: Please be seated.
We are going to continue this morning with the
cross-examination of Mr. Zhou.
Remember that you're still under oath.
You may inquire.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
LE ZHOU,

O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
Q. About 20?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. And when you were going through these 20 items, who
decided on bringing these to court?
A. I decided.
Q. Okay. So you're the one who chose which items were
introduced as these exhibits?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. Did you discuss that with the prosecutors?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Did they give you suggestions as to which items
should be brought in?
A. They mentioned not a particular item, but in the category.
Q. Okay. Like what kind of categories?
A. Hats, shirts, pants, and what I did jewelry.
Q. Sorry, I didn't hear the last part.
A. No, no. Jewelry. Sorry.
Q. Okay. So they didn't ask you to bring in jewelry?
A. No.
Q. You picked the whistle. Do you consider the whistle to be
jewelry?
A. I picked whistles, two whistles, yes.
Q. Okay. So you picked two whistles to show?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. But they only asked you about one, right?



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
A. Correct.
Q. So they did make some decisions --
A. No, they kept one.
Q. Okay. But in court they only showed you one, right?
A. Yes.
Q. So they did make some decisions about what to show here in
court, right?
THE COURT: He cannot testify as to what they were
thinking. He can testify as to whether he made the decision.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay.
Q. You decided that you would bring two whistles to show to
court; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And the prosecutors only showed you one here in
court, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Thank you.
Now, the approximately 20 items or so that you
purchased from G Fashion, did you discuss all of them with the
prosecutors?
A. I purchased more than 20 items.
Q. Okay. I'm sorry. Roughly how many items did you purchase?
A. About 30 items.
Q. Thirty items. Okay.
Remember yesterday you testified about the whistle;



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
correct?
A. Correct.
Q. And that was the gold whistle, right?
A. Correct.
Q. It was a commemorative item of some sort?
A. I'm sorry?
Q. It was a commemorative item of some sort?
A. It was a limited edition, was only 77 made.
Q. Okay. Sorry. Limited edition.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we bring up just for the witness,
the Court, and the parties GX VO-67, please.
Your Honor, after conferring with the government, it
seems this is in, so I'm going to ask to publish it to the jury
as well.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
Q. All right. So, Mr. Zhou, do you see the date of this
email?
A. Yes.
Q. All right. It's February 28, 2021; is that right?
A. Correct.
Q. All right. And this is when you -- this is the order
confirmation for when you bought the limited edition whistle;
correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Now, you testified, I believe, that when you received the



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
whistle, there was something that made you suspicious about it,
right?
A. Correct.
Q. That's why you weighed it, right?
A. I weighed it, yes.
Q. Okay. And you weighed it because you thought there might
be something wrong with it?
A. When I receive it, when I first opened it, the packaging
inside, it was a little bit of gold dust on it. And, of
course, I pick up the whistle. The craftsmanship, it looked to
me a little bit rough. Because this is a limited edition,
that's collectible items, as the G Fashion promoted, this is a
best, best craftsmanship items, so that's why I had concerns.
Q. Okay. So you were dissatisfied with it; is that right?
A. Not dissatisfied. Because still as advertised, this is a
limited edition — only 77 in the world. I understand that
value itself, it's there. But what it is when I receive it,
it's what I received.
THE COURT: Mr. Kamaraju, would you draw the
microphone closer to you, please.
MR. KAMARAJU: Sorry, your Honor. Yes.
Is that better?
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay.
Q. And please let me know if you can't hear me.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
A. I hear you.
Q. Thank you.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we show for the witness and the
parties and the Court GX V0-33 -- sorry, VO-33.
Q. Mr. Zhou, do you recognize this document?
A. Yes.
Q. What is it?
A. This is screenshot I capture of the G Fashion website.
Q. Okay. And what does the screenshot reflect?
A. Reflect my previous order and item dates, the amount paid.
Q. Okay. And the amount paid for what?
A. All the item -- most of item purchased. This is not all of
it.
Q. Okay. So this is most of the items you purchased, but from
G Fashion; is that right?
A. Correct.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. Your Honor, I'm going to offer
Government Exhibit VO-33 into evidence.
THE COURT: No objection?
MS. MURRAY: No objection.
THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Government's Exhibit VO-33 received in evidence)
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we publish it, please.
Q. All right. So previously we looked at the order
confirmation for the whistle purchase; correct?



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
A. Correct.
Q. And that was February 28, 2021; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So if you look down at the fifth row from the
bottom, so February 12th, 2021; correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. So after that date --
MR. KAMARAJU: And we can pull that down.
Q. After that date, you made a number of purchases of G
Fashion clothing, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And I believe you testified that this doesn't even reflect
all of the G Fashion purchases that you've made, right?
A. Correct.
Q. So despite your concerns about the craftsmanship of the
whistle, you continued to buy G Fashion, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you continued to spend a significant amount of money on
G Fashion, right?
A. To spend the money also was towards to help the G Fashion
grow. Because my understanding, I'm part of the G Fashion
stock shareholder. I will contribute as much any way I can,
even by purchasing items.
Q. So you were trying to contribute to the growth of G Fashion
by purchasing these items, right?



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
A. Correct.
Q. And you believe that G Fashion was -- withdrawn.
You believe that the growth of G Fashion was important
to the movement's goals; correct?
A. Because Miles Guo mentioned G Fashion valuation was
tremendous high, also reach billions dollars.
Q. Right. But I asked you if you understood that the growth
of G Fashion was important to the movement, sir?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So you were trying to -- in addition to whatever you
just testified to, you were trying to also help the movement by
purchasing G Fashion wear; is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. So you continued to buy G Fashion wear, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Now, you had previously -- withdrawn.
Prior to buying a G Clubs membership, you had also
purchased G Fashion, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Now, after you purchased your G Clubs membership, you
started receiving discounts on your G Fashion wear, right?
A. Correct.
Q. How much -- what percentage discount were you receiving?
A. Fifty percent.
Q. Okay. And so each time you bought one of these items you



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
got 50 percent off, right?
A. Not every time.
Q. After you bought the G Clubs membership, right, sir?
A. Correct.
Q. So how much in total discounts did you get, sir?
A. If estimated, the discount -- I'm sorry, I couldn't get
accurate discount on the amount of numbers.
Q. Well, how much of a refund did you ask for, sir?
A. Refund from which --
Q. G Fashion.
A. I ask for over $12,000 refund from G Fashions.
Q. Okay. And $12,000 is what you spent after receiving the 50
percent discount?
A. Also includes nondiscount items.
Q. It also includes nondiscounted items?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. So would it be fair to say that your discount amount
was in the thousands of dollars, sir?
MS. MURRAY: Objection to form.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Yes.
Q. It was over $10,000, right, sir?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So you paid $50,000 for the membership, right?
A. Yes.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
Q. And in the course of a year and a half or so, you earned
more than $10,000 in discounts, right?
MS. MURRAY: Objection. Form.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Yes.
Q. And those were for products that you were also buying
because you wanted to help the movement, right?
MS. MURRAY: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Could you repeat the question, please.
Q. Sure.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we have it read back please?
THE COURT: Go ahead.
(Record read)
A. Not just help, but also towards to -- to help this company
grow and to get the stock value high.
Q. Right. But, sir, didn't you just testify a few minutes ago
that one of the reasons why you were buying G Fashion was to
help the movement?
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained. Asked and answered.
Q. When did you ask for your refund, sir?
A. I couldn't remember the dates.
Q. Was it after you started talking to the prosecutors?
A. No.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
Q. So you requested your refund prior to speaking with the
prosecutors, is that your testimony?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's for G Fashion, sir; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. What about your G Clubs refund, when did you ask for that?
A. I filed it July 15, 2023.
Q. So you remember the date of the -- so the G Clubs refund
was July 15, 2023; is that right?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. Was the G Fashion refund request made after that?
A. I don't recall that.
Q. So you don't remember if the G Fashion one was before or
after the G Clubs?
MS. MURRAY: Objection.
THE COURT: Asked and answered.
Q. Now, if you look at GX VO-33, there's a line for March 1st,
2021; correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. The first line there. Do you see that?
A. I see the highlighted, yes.
Q. Right. Okay. So that reflects a column for which you
received a refund for an item, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So at any point if you were dissatisfied with



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
something, you could request a refund; correct?
A. This particular item was out of stock.
Q. Okay. So you were dissatisfied with -- you didn't receive
the item, so you got a refund, right?
A. It was out of stock. I never received.
Q. I'm sorry, sir, I'm just asking if you received a refund?
A. Was credit to the credit store.
Q. Now, you spoke a minute ago about the G Clubs membership.
And I believe you testified on direct that you paid for both of
those memberships by check, right?
A. Correct.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we have GX VO-26, please, which
is in evidence. Bring that up for the jury as well.
Q. So these are the checks, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay.
MR. KAMARAJU: And if we could scroll to page 10,
please.
Q. All right. Now, this is -- this is your member page, is
that fair to say?
A. Correct.
Q. All right. So it reflects your name with your Tier 5
membership, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And it lists membership benefits there? It's on the left



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
side.
A. Yes.
Q. Could you just read what it says there?
A. "G Fashion 50 percent off, G Club brochure."
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. And could we go to page 12 of
that exhibit, please.
Okay. Sorry, this is the check again, right? Okay.
Sorry. This is the right one.
Q. All right. This is the membership page for the Tier 2
membership that you purchased, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. Now, this you purchased on behalf of your sister,
right?
A. No, at the moment was introduced as we purchase; in the
future we can transfer to the family.
Q. Okay. Could you explain that please, sir.
A. Yes. Miles Guo mentioned the G Club, the membership, the
Tier 1 to Tier 5. The follower, we can purchase, but that was
offered the passport. But my sister doesn't have to -- I don't
need to put her name first. I have the right to transfer to my
directed family members.
Q. So if I understand correctly, sir, the idea was that you
could purchase the membership in your name so that eventually
you could transfer it to a family member if you wanted, right?
A. Correct.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
Q. Okay. And was that benefit -- in your mind, was that
benefit particularly useful for family members who are located
in China?
A. Only to the direct family members; doesn't matter if in
China or other countries.
Q. Okay. So anywhere, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Now, you filled out a G Clubs membership agreement;
correct?
A. There's no agreement. I never signed it or received.
MR. KAMARAJU: So can we go to page 8, please. Can we
just blow up the -- that email.
A. This is a payment received confirmation emails.
Q. Right. I was just asking if you could read the first line
of the email, sir.
A. Yes.
"Dear Le Zhou, on 2021 August 25 at 0:47:10, you
submitted your completed and executed application to become a
Tier 5 member of G Clubs. We received your membership fee in
the amount of $50,000. Your application is under review and we
may contact you for additional information. We will email you
confirmation of our decision within 30 days."
Q. Okay. So I just want to make sure I understand correctly,
sir. You said you never submitted a G Clubs application; is
that right?



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay.
Q. So you received this email without having submitted that
application; is that right?
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MR. KAMARAJU: We can take that down. Thank you.
Q. Now, on direct you testified that Mr. Guo ultimately gave
you the opportunity to purchase H Coin, right?
A. He mention the H Coin would be offered to followers.
Q. Okay. But there is a point at which H Coin could not be
purchased by U.S. residents, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And so I believe you testified on direct that there came a
point where U.S. residents could purchase H Coin; correct?
A. Not a -- well, he said in the future will expand the H
Himalaya exchange territory by once a proper license acquired.
Q. Okay. So once the proper license is acquired, then U.S.
residents may be able to purchase it, right?
A. Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we have GX VO-78, please, which
is in evidence.
Q. Okay, sir. Can you just remind us what this is?
A. Yes. This is a nominee shareholder agreement provided to



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
me from UK London Club.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. And the first line under letter
of agreement, can we just blow that up.
Q. All right. Do you see the line that starts: "I am pleased
to inform you that"?
A. Yes.
Q. And do you see where it says: "In recognition of the
contributions made by you"?
A. Yes.
Q. That's a reference to your contributions to the farm,
right?
A. No, the contribution I understand is all of the previous G
Series investments.
Q. Okay. So your understanding is that the contributions that
are referred to here are the G Series of investments, not the
work that you did on behalf of the farm?
A. Some contributions for volunteer works towards
contributions, donation contributions.
Q. So it all goes together in figuring out the contribution,
right?
A. The work, the time, effort put into it and the donations.
Q. Yes. That's what I was referring to, the work and the
contributions; they all play in together in determining your --
what benefit you receive, right?
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
THE COURT: Overruled. You may continue.
A. At that time, yes, the contribution, I understand it as the
donations and the time and effort put into it.
MR. KAMARAJU: Now, could we go to page 8, please.
I'm sorry, could we scroll back to page 7 quickly.
Q. Do you see the subparagraph there that starts C?
A. Yes.
Q. All right. You see the part that says: "You hereby
consent to not performing the following"?
A. Yes.
Q. And it goes on to say "to allow you to benefit and
continue," do you see that language?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So this is telling you things that you should not do
if you want to keep the preferential H Coin allotment, right?
A. I'm sorry?
Q. This provision is talking about things that you should not
do in order to maintain the beneficial H Coin offering you were
getting, right?
A. Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. If we could go to the next page
and just blow up No. 3, please.
Q. Could you read that, sir?
A. Yeah.
"You undertake to not demonstrate, whether directly or



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
indirectly, or otherwise facilitate in any form, any support or
benefit in any form, to the Chinese Communist Party, CCP,
quote, or any CCP officials."
Q. Okay. So one of the things that you should refrain from
doing is supporting the CCP, right?
A. I'm sorry, referring --
Q. Well, you testified previously that this is talking about
things you shouldn't do to keep your H Coin allotment, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And one of the things is not support the CCP, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Because the movement is anti CCP, right?
A. Correct.
Q. So if you supported the CCP, obviously that would be anti
the movement, right?
A. Not me support, but --
Q. Anyone, sir. I'm not referring to you specifically.
A. Correct.
Q. Now, you talked a little bit about the work that you did on
behalf of the farms, right?
A. Correct.
Q. So you actually did a substantial amount of work for the
farms, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Tell us again what kind of work you did.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
A. Transcripts, reviewing translation, and we did editing and
streamings.
Q. Okay. So is it fair to say that the work you just
described is targeted to disseminating the movement's message?
A. Help to spread the words, yes.
Q. Okay. And you knew that broadcasting was a significant
part of the movement's efforts, right?
A. I will say equal to other informations, other type of work.
Q. Okay. And I'm not asking you to say what's more or not,
I'm just saying it was a big part of what the movement did was
broadcasting, right?
A. No, it's not big part. I say it's equal to other work.
Q. Okay. Well, you first learned of Mr. Guo by watching
online videos that have been posted; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And did you first see him on YouTube?
A. Yes.
Q. When was that again?
A. February 2017.
Q. So you saw Mr. Guo -- withdrawn.
Was that on Mr. Guo's YouTube account?
A. No.
Q. Okay. So you saw him being rebroadcast on somebody else's
YouTube account?
A. Not a rebroadcast. He appear on an interview on someone's



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
broadcast channels.
Q. Which interview was that?
A. The channel was called Mirror Media.
Q. All right. And in the video he expressed some criticism of
the Chinese Communist Party, is that fair?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And subsequently after you became involved with the
movement, the movement also put out broadcasting that was
critical of the Chinese Communist Party, right?
A. Yes.
Q. In fact, that was the goal of GTV, was to be able to
broadcast that kind of --
MS. MURRAY: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled. You can express your
understanding of the goal of GTV.
MR. KAMARAJU: I'll phrase it that way, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.
Q. It was your understanding that the goal of GTV was to be
able to broadcast messages that were critical of the CCP to
people in China; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Now, there were some people in the movement who appeared in
the broadcast; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And there were some people who did work for the movement



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
who did not appear on the broadcast; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And did you ever appear in a broadcast?
A. I appeared just by voicing, not appears as physically, like
appearances.
Q. So you only used your voice, you didn't show your face; is
that right?
A. Correct.
Q. Why didn't you show your face?
A. Because I want to keep it just not -- I just decide not to
show my face.
Q. Was there any reason?
A. Well, so I don't want to --
MS. MURRAY: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Yeah. Because I also don't want to be target by the CCP.
Q. Sorry. Did you say you didn't want to be targeted by the
CCP; is that right?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. Thank you.
Now, you also testified on direct about the fact that
farm members used Discord, right?
A. Yes.
Q. What is your understanding of why they used Discord instead
of, you know, text messaging, for example?



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
A. The reason I don't know.
Q. And you also testified on direct about WebEx, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have an understanding as to why they chose WebEx?
A. This part of reason I know.
Q. Whatever you know, sir.
A. Is because WebEx has a feature allow over 100 participants
to be online at the same time.
Q. Were you on WebExes that had over 100 participants?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So those were large gatherings of movement members?
A. Yes.
Q. Was Mr. Guo part of any of those?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And everybody who was on that WebEx could speak if
they wanted to, right?
A. No.
Q. No?
A. No.
Q. Why?
A. Because it was some people muted; there was only have a
speaker allowed to speak.
Q. Okay. So someone would have to recognize the speaker,
right?
A. Yes.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
Q. Okay. Now, you also used a Discord name. I believe it was
Coffee Cantana, do I have that right?
A. Coffee Cantata.
Q. Cantata. Okay. Thank you, sir.
Is there a reason why you picked that name?
A. Yes.
Q. What's that?
A. I personally like to drink coffee. I play the classic
music. Cantata is a piece of the classic music.
Q. So it was related to your interests, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. And you interacted with other movement members who
were also using Discord names, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And even some people who appeared in broadcasts used, I'll
say, pseudonyms, right?
A. I'm sorry?
Q. They used different names than their real names, right,
some people who appeared in broadcasts?
A. Correct.
Q. Like Mulan, for example, right?
A. Correct.
Q. That's not -- do you know somebody named Octopus?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. That's not Octopus's real name either, right?



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
A. That's not.
Q. Did Octopus ever appear in a broadcast?
A. I do not recall that.
Q. Okay. How about Nebula?
A. Yes.
Q. You know somebody who went by the name "Nebula"?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And that wasn't that person's real name either?
A. Correct.
Q. Did that person appear in a broadcast?
A. I do not recall that.
Q. Do you have an understanding as to why they were using
different names?
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Now, in addition to doing kind of the video streaming work
that you talked about, right, you also opened bank accounts on
behalf of the farms, right?
A. Correct.
Q. So you were entrusted with receiving the money from other
farm members, right?
A. I don't know what's from other farm members.
Q. Okay. Let me put it this way: You were entrusted with the
money that the UK farm was receiving, right?
A. I cannot make that entrust because that's something someone



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
has to say if they entrust me or not, but I didn't receive that
type of --
Q. Okay. You were given authority over the bank account that
contained the money, right?
A. Under authority, I'm sorry?
Q. You were given the authority over the bank account that
received the money, right?
A. I was instructed to open account.
Q. Okay. Was it your name on the account, sir?
A. The account I was a signer.
Q. Okay.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we show for just the parties, the
Court, and the witness, DX 60476, please.
Q. While that's being pulled up, how many different bank
accounts did you open up, sir?
A. Three.
Q. Three. And were those all in the same name?
A. No.
Q. They were in different companies' names, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And some of those companies you started, right?
A. No, I didn't start a company.
Q. You didn't start any companies?
A. That's not my company.
Q. Well, okay. I'm just asking whether you -- did your name



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
appear on any formation documents for one of the companies,
sir?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And when you opened those accounts, I think you
testified on direct that you told the banks that they were for
your real estate business, right?
A. I was instructed to tell them that.
Q. Okay. But that is what you told them, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you told them that, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And that wasn't true, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Because in reality, you were receiving the money from --
that the farm was taking in, right?
A. I would say not say the farm, because all the wire to me
didn't tell me which one was farm, which farm or individual,
the person's relation. I know -- I know was farm the follower
wanted to invest in G Series.
Q. Yeah. Sorry, sir, I wasn't asking about where the money
came from. I was saying this was the money that the UK farm
was receiving, right?
A. Yes.
Q. The money wasn't going to your real estate business, right?
A. No.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
Q. Okay. So you misrepresented the nature of the account to
the bank, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And you did that because you were trying to help the
movement, right?
A. Help the followers.
Q. Right. Help the followers, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And help the UK farm, right?
A. Just help the followers.
Q. I'm sorry, sir, maybe I'm not understanding. Could you
explain the distinction that you're drawing there.
A. Yes. My intention help the farm because the UK London farm
leader tell me that -- ask me my help to help the followers,
but didn't specify if the follower was all from the UK London
Club or other farms.
Q. Okay. So how much money would you say came into the bank
accounts that you opened?
A. About $2 million.
Q. About $2 million.
And do you remember from roughly how many recipients
it came in from? Or, sorry, withdrawn.
Do you remember from approximately how many senders it
came in from?
A. Approximately 50.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
Q. Approximately 50, sir? Sorry, is that what you said?
A. Correct.
Q. All right. I think DX 60476 is on your screen now.
Could you just take a look at that, please.
A. Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. Maybe we can scroll to the next
page.
Q. Do you recognize this document, sir?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Does your signature appear on it?
A. Yes.
Q. What's the date next to your signature?
A. February 24th, 2021.
Q. Okay. And what is this document, sir?
A. Oh, yeah. This is -- Florida, state of Florida business
status. I think it's certifications.
Q. Certification. Okay.
MR. KAMARAJU: Let's go to page 2. Sorry, page 2.
Q. Do you recognize this?
A. Yes.
Q. What's this?
A. This is from IRS about the EIN numbers.
Q. And do you see the name of a company listed in the first
sentence, sir?
A. Yes.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
Q. Okay. Is that one of the companies that you used to open
bank accounts for the UK farm?
A. This name was created by the UK farm, I use to open
account.
MR. KAMARAJU: Your Honor, the government -- I did it
again. The defense is going to offer DX 60476 into evidence.
MS. MURRAY: No objection.
THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Defendant's Exhibit 60476 received in evidence)
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you. Could we publish to the
jury? I promise I won't do it three times.
Q. So this is the formation documents for one of those
companies; correct?
A. Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we go to the next page, please.
Page after that, please. Thanks. And just blow up the
signature line.
Q. Do you see where it says "incorporator," sir?
A. Yes.
Q. Whose signature is that?
A. Mine.
Q. So you began this company on February 24th, 2021, right?
A. I registered it myself, but the director was still listed
as the UK leaders.
Q. Okay. I was just -- you registered it on this day, right?



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
A. Yes.
Q. All right. So you first started opening bank accounts to
receive the money for the UK farm in 2021, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Now, as part of your work receiving the money, did you also
account for how the money was being spent?
A. I documented, yes.
Q. So you looked at the bank statements to see where the money
was going?
A. The money was only instructed to wire out.
Q. I'm sorry, could you say that again?
A. All the money was instructed to wire out.
Q. All the money was instructed to wire out.
A. Correct.
Q. Right. So you never received any instructions to wire
money to Mr. Guo, right?
A. Not to him.
Q. Okay. Now, we talked a little bit about the volunteer work
that you did for the farm. The farm more broadly did volunteer
work as well, right?
A. Yes.
Q. There was a project in the Ukraine; is that right?
A. That's a farm Himalaya Global Alliance, not just one farm.
Q. Okay. So several farms united in that effort?
A. All farms participated.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
Q. Okay. And what were they doing?
A. There was the Ukraine.
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor. Relevance.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. It was Ukraine, humanitarian missions. They were be called
to the borderline between Poland and the Ukraine. The mission
was to rescue Chinese nationals and to do other humanitarian
works.
THE COURT: Rescue them from where?
THE WITNESS: Between the borderline at Poland and the
Ukraine.
Q. Okay. Thank you.
Now, you testified on direct that you became concerned
about the way some of the money was being spent that had come
into those bank accounts; is that right?
A. Not a concern to those accounts.
Q. So you never had any concern about those accounts; is that
right?
A. There were meetings, private meetings, between Miles Guo
and UK London Club. There were things mentioned just from the
UK London Club financials, status, and province. There were --
misproper used funds was addressed.
Q. Okay. Who was misusing the funds?
A. At the time the meeting, David Dai, the leader of UK London
Club, was accused misused global donation, global foundation



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
funds.
Q. So he was -- he was accused -- withdrawn.
David Dai was accused of misusing Rule of Law
Foundation funds at this meeting?
A. At that meeting, yes.
Q. Okay. But that meeting was a meeting of the UK farm?
A. Yes.
Q. So they were discussing misuse of the foundation's money at
the farm meeting, right?
MS. MURRAY: Objection. 401, 403.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. That was mentioned in the meeting, yes.
Q. Okay. Now, I think you just said Mr. Guo was part of that
meeting, right?
A. Yes.
Q. So he was part of this discussion about these accusations,
right?
A. Yes. He was there.
Q. Okay. And the topic was -- or one of the topics at least
were these accusations, right?
A. Yes.
Q. So you heard Mr. Guo discuss those accusations, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And it was resolved to look into those accusations,
right, figure out if they were real?



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
A. I don't know if they were resolved.
Q. It was decided at the meeting, sir?
A. It wasn't decided; it was just brought it out, the
accusations.
Q. Okay. Did anybody reach a decision as to what to do about
the accusations at that meeting?
A. At a meeting Miles Guo even ask one person from the Rule of
Law Foundations. To my knowledge, the person keeps track of
the funds, Miles Guo personally ask that person about the David
Dai's accusations.
Q. Okay. So Mr. Guo asked that person about the accusations,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. And the accusations were that UK David — that's David Dai,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. — was misusing the funds; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Were there any other accusations made against UK David of
misappropriating funds?
A. Yes.
Q. How many times did that happen?
MS. MURRAY: Objection.
THE COURT: You can step up.
(Continued on next page)



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
(At sidebar)
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, as an initial matter, this is
hearsay that he's trying to elicit. In addition, the
accusations that there was a misuse of funds is being
introduced and offered for the truth, for the fact that there
was, in fact, misuse of funds and this 403 problem.
MR. KAMARAJU: Well, first of all, any introduction of
a defendant's out-of-court statement is not automatically
hearsay. We're simply eliciting his testimony to show when
there were accusations, they were taken seriously and people
were investigated, including Mr. Guo. So you have to at least
establish that the accusations were made. Whether they are
true or not, we don't know; we're not asking the witness to
opine on whether they are true. We're just saying they wanted
to look into it.
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, I don't see how they are not
being offered for their truth here.
THE COURT: They are being offered for their truth.
MR. KAMARAJU: But I didn't even ask him if the
accusations were true, your Honor.
THE COURT: You want to use those accusations to make
the argument that Mr. Guo had a legitimate interest in guarding
the funds for the cause.
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes. And so the only relevant fact
there is that there were accusations made, not whether the



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
accusations are true or not, which is all I'm trying to elicit.
And that's all I've elicited so far.
MS. SHROFF: In fact, Mr. Kamaraju could ask: You
don't know if these accusations were true or false. We are not
trying to introduce them for their truthfulness.
MS. MURRAY: He's already established the fact that
there were accusations. So the additional line of questioning
into "there were other accusations, weren't there," is leading
into, again, trying to indicate and imply the truth of a fact
that there were accusations of misuse of funds. I don't see
any other purpose for it to come in and it's unduly
prejudicial.
MR. KAMARAJU: The purpose is the same no matter how
many times I ask the question about accusations.
MS. MURRAY: Right. And it's already in evidence now.
THE COURT: So it seems that there are two purposes,
both for the fact of the accusation and for the truth of the
accusation, because you want to portray Mr. Guo as guarding
these funds for his political cause.
MR. KAMARAJU: But I don't believe that the second
point requires the accusations to be true or false.
If the U.S. Attorney's Office investigates somebody
and responds to a victim complaint, that's not a statement of
the victim complaint is true or it's false; it's simply
evidence that the U.S. Attorney's Office took the victim



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
complaint seriously. You don't have to have the truth of the
victim complaint in order to establish that they took it
seriously.
MS. MURRAY: I think at bottom, your Honor,
Mr. Kamaraju is saying what he wants to get in is the fact that
there were accusations. That's already in. So there's no
additional line of questioning that would be fruitful unless
it's going to something improper.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, because we're allowed to point out
the fact that it happened more than once. That goes to how
serious they took it.
MS. SHROFF: And that each time the accusation was
addressed, not whether the accusation was true or false. You
are free to elicit on redirect that the accusations were, in
fact, false. Of course that's your prerogative. But that does
not make Mr. Kamaraju's questioning improper or unduly
prejudicial. In fact, that was the whole point of your direct.
Your whole point of the direct was to show that Mr. Guo did
nothing. So we're entitled to show that what you did on direct
was improper.
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, again, it's hearsay. They
are focusing on what Mr. Guo did and what Mr. Guo said. Here
they are asking this witness with respect to how seriously the
accusations were taken or not. I think we've established this
witness said he didn't know what decision was made or whether



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
there was a resolution to take certain action or not.
THE COURT: So you can ask whether there were any
other accusations, but it's going to stop there.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay, your Honor.

O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
(In open court)
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. There came a point where the UK farm was dissolved;
correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Why was that?
A. Because there were -- at the time Himalaya Global Alliance
started doing statistical work to gather all the farms'
financial balance sheets, and also at the time to have all the
farms to wire all the balance each farm held to the Himalaya
Global Alliance. And at the time because accusation made it to
David Dai, and also he has some unwired balance, it was quite a
big amount of balance that Miles Guo ask him also provide him a
deadline to wire. He failed that.
Q. What was the -- I think you referred to it as an unwired
balance. What was that?
A. Because there's some funds the farm held. The fund has to
be transferred to the Himalaya Global Alliance, designated
accounts. And a couple other meetings, there were -- Miles Guo
gave David Dai a deadline to wire the balance which he failed
to do that. So that impact dissolving the whole farms, and
also Miles Guo strip his title and he was terminated from
this -- sorry, not terminated, he was removed from the farm and
from the movement.
Q. Was there a reason given for his termination from the farm



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
and the movement?
A. That I don't know.
Q. So you weren't privy to any of those reasons?
A. I was in the meeting.
Q. Now, I'd like to talk a little bit about the refunds that
you requested, okay?
A. Sure.
Q. You asked for a refund from G Fashion, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And you asked for a refund from G Clubs, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Now, when you asked for the refund from G Clubs, did you go
to the company and ask for a refund?
A. Yes, I did email them.
Q. Okay. So you emailed G Clubs for a refund?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you get a response?
A. Only email I was received, just acknowledgment they
received my request. After that, no more response.
Q. And that response -- withdrawn.
That refund request was made, I think you testified,
in July of 2023, right?
A. I can't remember the dates.
Q. You don't remember testifying earlier today that it was
July 2023?



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
A. The whole other refund which, I mean, July 15, 2023, was
started, initiated to the Washington, D.C. farms.
Q. Oh, I'm sorry. I misunderstood. The July 15 date is when
you applied to the farms for the refunds?
A. Yes.
Q. Approximately how long before you went to the farms did you
submit the G Clubs request?
A. That I don't remember.
Q. Well, not asking for a specific date, but months, years,
weeks?
A. Months.
Q. Months. Okay.
And it was several months after you had purchased your
G Club membership initially, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Why did you go to the farms to get a refund from G Clubs?
A. Because Miles Guo instructed any follower, any problem,
issues will first contact the farm leaders, which at the time I
was associated with Washington, D.C. farm. So, as instructed,
that is what I did.
Q. But you went to G Clubs first, right?
A. No, I don't remember if went to G Club first.
Q. Sir, I thought you just testified a moment ago that you
went -- months prior to submitting a farm request --
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
Mischaracterizes the testimony.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Okay. So do you remember? Did you go to G Clubs first or
the farms first?
A. I don't remember --
MS. MURRAY: Objection, asked and answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Okay. I'm sorry, sir. You said that you went to the farms
because Mr. Guo said you should go there first, right?
A. Not first. You have any issues, we will go to the farm
leader.
Q. And what did you think it was that the farm leader could do
for you with respect to G Clubs?
A. Miles Guo mention the farm leader roles. Leader roles only
to serve the followers. There's no class or underling. Every
follower and the leader are equal.
Q. Okay. I was just asking what you thought that the farms
could do for you with respect to G Clubs?
A. Because that's a rule, which farm you're associated with.
And you only can associate with one farm. So at the time I was
with Washington, D.C. farm. That's only farm I can go to.
Q. I understand, sir, you went to the Washington farm because
that's -- that was your farm, right?
A. At that time, yes.
Q. Okay. I'm just understanding -- I'm just trying to



O5TVGUO1 Le Zhou - Cross
understand why you thought the farm could help you out with a G
Clubs problem?
A. Because that's -- Miles Guo stated anything, if it's
related to the movement, G Series, we can go to the leaders of
the farm.
Q. Okay. And what were the farm leaders supposed to do, sir?
A. To help with my request.
Q. Okay. Were you expecting the farms to pay the money back
to you that you had spent on G Clubs?
A. That I didn't expect.
Q. What kind of help were you expecting?
A. My hope was to have the farm leader first to acknowledge
that and for my request. Then the second was I just -- going
to just wait for the answer, but I don't expect what will be
the next. But my ultimate goal was to get a refund.
(Continued on next page)



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Cross
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. Okay. And you did ultimately get a refund; is that right?
A. Yes, I received a G/CLUBS refund.
Q. Okay. And prior to getting the G/CLUBS refund, they made a
request that you returned some equipment, right?
A. Correct.
Q. What was that equipment?
A. It was streaming equipment.
Q. Okay. And why did you have that equipment?
A. Because the Washington, DC Farm send it to me for the
streaming, for the farm streaming, to use for the farm
streaming; also, the equipment was used during the protest
streamings, for the Himalaya Global Alliance.
Q. Okay. So it was used to broadcast farm business,
basically?
A. And for the Himalaya Global Alliance.
Q. Was it expensive equipment?
A. To my knowledge, yes.
Q. Did you send the equipment back, sir?
A. Yes.
Q. Who did you send it to?
A. I sent it to Washington, DC Farm. They provided the
address.
Q. Okay. And do you have any knowledge as to what they did
with that once you returned it?



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Cross
A. After I returned it, they had one person inspect it, and
then once inspected everything thoroughly, I had a
confirmation, item was received, inspected.
Q. Okay. And then you received your refund after that; is
that right?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. About how long was it after that that you got your
refund?
A. I got my refund on December 1, 2023.
Q. And when was the inspection?
A. That was in——about October.
Q. Of 2023?

O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Cross

were in connection to a man named Luc Despins; is that right?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. And he was the bankruptcy trustee, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Were all of the streams that you personally participated in
against——sorry. Withdrawn.

MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. That I don't.
Q. Sorry. You said you don't, right?
A. I don't.
Q. Okay. And you testified on direct that at the time of the
protests of the bankruptcy trustee, you didn't have any

A. At the time I believed it.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. Your Honor, at this time the
defense would like to read and enter into evidence a
stipulation between the parties.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
MR. KAMARAJU: It's DX Stip 0001. And it reads:
"It is hereby stipulated and agreed by the United
States of America and Miles Guo, the defendant, through their
attorneys of record, that:
"1. The FBI has investigated individuals who, working
at the direction of the government of the People's Republic of
China (the "PRC government") have engaged in an international
campaign, known as "Operation Fox Hunt," to coerce individuals
located in the United States and elsewhere to return to China
to face charges brought by the PRC government or to otherwise
reach financial settlements with the PRC government.
"2. In 2017, a US law enforcement agency assessed
that Mr. Miles Guo was the highest priority of China's



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Cross
repatriation efforts.
"3. In 2017, a US law enforcement agency received
information that Chinese officials were paying and providing
food and signs to protestors of Mr. Guo.
"4. In 2018, a US law enforcement agency received
information that the PRC government had established a special
investigative group in China to manage China's investigation
of, and actions against, Mr. Guo.
"5. To carry out some of the objectives of Fox Hunt,
in 2017, the PRC government tasked a specially designated group
of operatives ("the Group") with discrediting and harassing
individuals, including Mr. Guo, by using interactive computer
services and electronic communication systems. The Group is
based out of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau at a
facility in Beijing's Dong Cheng District. The Group was
previously referred to as the "Cyber Investigation Team" and
was later referred to as the 9112 Special Project Working
Group. The Group's tactics aimed at Mr. Guo included using
anonymized social media accounts operated by the Group and by
pressuring US social media companies to remove Mr. Guo and
US-based associates of Mr. Guo from social media platforms.
These efforts were part of the PRC government's broader effort
to prevent, disrupt, and harass Mr. Guo's use of social media
and other online platforms to disseminate and discuss
disfavored content. In or about December 2018, officers of the



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Cross
Group were directed to post three videos or posts daily with
YouTube and Facebook accounts, with one of the posts required
to be anti-Mr. Guo. On February 3, 2020, a PRC government
official issued a tasking requirement that every member of the
Group shall write an original article with content related to
targeting Mr. Guo, the COVID pandemic, or Hong Kong. The FBI
investigated the Group's activities, including its activities
aimed at Mr. Guo, and the US government has charged many of the
Group's members with violations of US law.
"6. Since Mr. Guo fled the PRC, the PRC government
has sought his return for prosecution in the PRC and has
employed numerous methods to effect Mr. Guo's capture or
arrest. In May 2017, the PRC government sent four undeclared
agents from the PRC's Ministry of State Security ("MSS") to the
United States to attempt to cause Mr. Guo's coerced
repatriation to the PRC as part of the Fox Hunt initiative.
The US government disrupted the PRC government's efforts to
forcefully repatriate Mr. Guo and Mr. Guo continued to reside
in the United States.
"7. Between May 2017 and January 2018, at least four
individuals, including George Higginbotham, Elliot Broidy,
Nickie Lum Davis, and Prakazrel Michel, never disclosed that
they were actually acting on behalf of foreign actors,
including the PRC government, to lobby officials in the Trump
administration in an effort to cause Mr. Guo's extradition to



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Redirect
China. Higginbotham, Broidy, Davis, and Michel were each
convicted of violating US law regarding their lobbying efforts.
The efforts of these individuals were not successful, and
Mr. Guo was never extradited at the request of the PRC
government. Instead, and since approximately 2015, Mr. Guo has
been able to reside in the United States with his family.
"8. On October 23, 2018, a court in Hong Kong entered
an order seizing and restraining Mr. Guo's assets in Hong Kong
and elsewhere under the court's jurisdiction.
"It is further stipulated and agreed that this
stipulation may be admitted into evidence."
And your Honor, I would offer DX Stip 0001.
THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Defendant's Exhibit Stip 0001 received in evidence)
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. So just one question, sir. Prior to hearing me read that
information out, had you heard any of that before?
A. Yes, I heard Miles Guo mentioned it, some of it.
Q. What did you hear him mention?
MS. MURRAY: Objection. Hearsay.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Okay. Other than Miles Guo's statements, did you hear it
anywhere else?
MS. MURRAY: Objection.



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Redirect
THE COURT: The fact of having heard it, he can
answer. It's that you can't state what you heard.
A. Just from Miles Guo.
MR. KAMARAJU: No further questions at this time, your
Honor.
THE COURT: Redirect?
MS. MURRAY: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.

RECROSS EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. You were asked a series of questions about who was the
leader of the——the ultimate leader of the farms, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you testified it was Miles Guo, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. In connection with the money that you took in as the

Miles Guo?
A. Not direct from him, no.



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Recross
Q. Mr. Guo never reached out to you and said do X with the
money, right?
A. He did.
Q. Mr. Guo reached out directly to you and said send the money
here?
A. No. In a meeting happened, took place with UK Farm, the
part of the meeting, Miles Guo asked not just David Dai to
return all the money, he asked all the member from UK London
Club who, direct or indirect, has the money from followers,
will do the same, by the deadline, to wire all the remaining
balance to those accounts.
Q. Okay. And he gave that direction to everybody, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Now you testified on redirect that you had lost $30,000,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. What is that based on?
A. The principals.
Q. But the principal of what, sir?
A. The principal from——there's a portion from the VOG
investments.
Q. Okay.
A. There were a portion from the coins I purchased. There
were parts of the money from farm loan.
Q. How much of the money came from the farm loans?



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Recross
A. I invested $21,000 for my farm loans.
Q. Okay. So of the $30,000 that you lost, $21,000 you say is
from the farm loans, right?
A. Part of it.
Q. I'm sorry. I don't understand.
A. It's——you asked the $30,000, the principal. The $21,000 to
the farm loan, that's principal. The VOG investment towards
the GTV, that was also invest $31,000 and $300, but I do
receive reimbursement from the fair funds. I got——there were
about 7 percent loss. Then adding together, that's estimated
about $30,000.
Q. Now your farm loan principal was due to be returned at the
end of the term of the loan, right?
A. The contract stated that, yes.
Q. Okay. And the term of the loan was extended in August of
2023, correct?
A. It was force extended, without my consent.
Q. They didn't need your consent, though, right? They had the
right to do it under the contract, right?
A. That I don't recall if it's their right to do that.
Q. So you don't remember one way or the other.
A. I receive a notice just purely for extension 24
hours——months, without any option to opt out.
Q. Okay. So 24 months from August of 2023, right?
A. Yes.



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Recross
Q. Okay. So your farm loan is not actually due to be repaid
until next year, right?
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor. Scope.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MR. KAMARAJU: Your Honor, could we have a sidebar on
that quickly.
THE COURT: Yes.
(Continued on next page)



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Recross
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: Your objection?
MS. MURRAY: Yes, your Honor. So objection to scope
but also objection on 403 grounds. There is an implication
here that the witness could have contracted out of being
defrauded. He just said that he was forced to extend the loan.
He had no consent; it was just given to him. And Mr. Kamaraju
is now suggesting that there was a provision in the original
loan that permitted that. But there's not an ability to
explain what this witness knew. And it also calls for him to
bring a legal conclusion that he is not equipped to make.
THE COURT: Certainly on the grounds of legal
conclusion, he's not a lawyer. He can't interpret a contract.
MR. KAMARAJU: I can ask him what his understanding
is, right?
THE COURT: You could ask what his understanding is.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. I'll ask that question.
MS. MURRAY: He can't contract himself out of a fraud,
and that's the 403 basis for the objection.
MR. KAMARAJU: They brought up the idea of the refund,
your Honor, and allowed him to say that. They can allege it's
a fraud; we're allowed to allege that it's not.
MS. MURRAY: And your Honor, I would just note, he
said he didn't recall what was in the contract. So he's
already asked a question that Mr. Kamaraju answered, or Mr. ——



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Recross
THE COURT: Was that the testimony? Can you go back
and see?
MS. MURRAY: Regarding the——if this is the regarding
the extension.
THE COURT: You want to first find out whether he
recalled if it's a term of the loan or the fact of the
extension?
MS. MURRAY: The fact of the ability of the
counterparty to require an extension without consent. That——
MR. KAMARAJU: That was not what my question went to.
My question just said simply——and I didn't ask the
understanding, but if I were to ask, I'd say, so your
understanding is that your loan is due to be repaid a year from
now.
MR. FERGENSON: No.
THE COURT: I want to go back to the testimony, if you
wouldn't mind.
(Record read)
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, he's established what this
witness knew and what he understood at the time, and he's
implying to the jury that he can contract out of the fraud, and
that's clearly impermissible under 403 and under black letter
law.
MR. KAMARAJU: I'm not saying anything whether he can
contract out of the fraud. They asked what his loss was. They



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Recross
brought that out, not us. And I'm simply saying that he
received a notice, he understands he received a notice, and is
it his understanding that under the notice, the loan will be
repaid a year from now.
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, there's no other probative
purpose for this other than to imply he can contract out of the
fraud. He said he wanted a refund of his money. He's speaking
to his losses. That is what he has testified to.
MR. KAMARAJU: Then they didn't need to bring up the
losses. I'm entitled to respond. They put it in issue, your
Honor, not me.
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, the fraud is complete as soon
as the misrepresentation is made.
THE COURT: His own understanding, that was it?
MR. KAMARAJU: If his losses are relevant. Ms. Murray
just said that the fraud is complete at the time of the
misrepresentation. If that's true, then the actual losses he
suffered are irrelevant. The government nonetheless elicited
it, so I'm entitled to say, that number is wrong, you testified
to an incorrect number, sir.
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, there's no accounting. He's
asked his understanding, he's given a summary of his
understanding of how much money he put in and how much money he
was not repaid, which was the guarantee that Miles Guo made and
did not follow through on.



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Recross
MR. KAMARAJU: This is a summation, your Honor.
That's fine. It can be presented to the jury in summation.
But prior to that we get to attack the very specific things
they elicit.
THE COURT: I'm going to allow what was your
understanding.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. So the question I'll ask, just
to make sure I'm complying: So under the notice you received,
what is your understanding as to when you will be paid back, or
when you should be paid back?
MS. MURRAY: And your Honor, we would ask that it go
no further than that because we still maintain our objection
that he's trying to elicit improper implications with this
witness, that it's a 403 problem.
MR. KAMARAJU: All of those implications that they
keep arguing at sidebar can be dealt with by your Honor when
you instruct the jury as to the law.
MS. MURRAY: No. It's confusing the jury now with
respect to this witness's testimony.
MR. KAMARAJU: We had this argument just yesterday.
THE COURT: I'm going to allow the question.
(Continued on next page)



O5T1GUO2 Le Zhou - Recross
(In open court)
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. Sir, when we paused, we were talking about the extension
notice. Do you remember that?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Based on your receipt of that notice, what is your
understanding as to when you should be paid back your farm loan
principal?
A. The notice——I think it's invalid, because my previous
contract signed with two entities, was both established by
David Dai. Since David Dai was terminated and removed by the
farm, and I believe those two entities both dissolved,
automatically, the contract is void.
Q. That's your legal conclusion, sir?
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled. Is that your legal conclusion?
A. Yes.
Q. Where did you go to law school?
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Okay. So your view is that the farm loan contract is null
and void now.
A. It's void.
Q. Okay. So if you were to sue somebody, you'd have nobody to
sue.

had any connections to the CCP?
A. I told her that I knew people who were party members but
that was all of it.
Q. How did Yvette Wang respond to that?
MS. SHROFF: Objection as to the hearsay.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. What, if anything, was Yvette's reaction when you said you
had connections to CCP members?
THE COURT: So you need to repeat her words.
MR. HORTON: Can I have one moment, your Honor.

MR. HORTON: Thank you, your Honor.

A. It's a photo.
Q. What is it a photo of?

Q. Ms. Maistrello, where is the Sherry-Netherland located?

MR. HORTON: Your Honor, the government would offer
GX BR871.
MS. SHROFF: No objection, your Honor.

MR. HORTON: Could you please publish it, Ms. Loftus.
BY MR. HORTON:
Q. Ms. Maistrello, the top of your accepted job offer says
Golden Spring, New York. What was Golden Spring, New York?
A. Golden Spring was my employer.
Q. What was the business of Golden Spring, New York?
A. It was presented to me on my very first day as an asset
management company.
Q. In your two years of working for Boss, what, if anything,
did you come to understand Golden Spring did?



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
A. Golden Spring was a company that took care of Boss's wishes
and desires, so it was the company through which we would
purchase things for Boss, or take care of his things.
MR. HORTON: Ms. Loftus, can you scroll down towards
the bottom of this page, please. Thank you.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, there's a signature on the page over a line
that says Yvette Wang, COO, Golden Spring, New York. What is
COO?

Q. When you worked for Boss, how often, if ever, did you work
with Yvette?

MR. HORTON: Ms. Loftus, can you please show the
witness what's been marked as Government Exhibit UK723.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, what is this?
A. It's a photo.
Q. And who is it a photo of?
A. There are four people in the photo. Boss is one of them,
his wife, daughter——
MS. SHROFF: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: If you'll step up.
(Continued on next page)



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: What's the objection?
MS. SHROFF: There's no relevance to the photo. She
didn't take the photo, she doesn't know——there's no indication
when this photo was taken, we don't know the year, we don't
know how she would know anything about this photo. The
government is using the photo to introduce people they want to
put into evidence. This is——it has no relevance to the
testimony.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
MR. HORTON: So the people in the photo, as
Ms. Maistrello is about to establish, that she can recognize
them from the photo. They're people who will feature in this
case; they're already featured in this case. You don't have to
take a photo to be able to authenticate it. It's black letter
authentication. And I'm laying a foundation. I think she's
almost there, if she's not there already. I'd ask to have the
photo admitted.
MS. SHROFF: What's the relevance of the photo?
There's no relevance of the photograph to this witness's
testimony. She's not going to testify about any——
THE COURT: He has said that these individuals will
play a part in the prosecution's case.
MS. SHROFF: Right, but not any part of her testimony.
So it may be down the road, if she wants——so that's my first



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
objection, your Honor. I didn't object to the photo of Yvette
because she's going to testify about Yvette. That's relevant
because it pertains to some part of her testimony. She's not
going to testify about any of these people.
THE COURT: She can authenticate the photo by
identifying these individuals. Let's see if she does.
Overruled.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, while we're at the sidebar,
though, I did have an objection to the government lawyers
constant looping of facts into each question. So each question
adds in a response from the witness, instead of just simply
asking the next question, there are facts baked in. The
looping theory of asking questions, I object to it.
And number two, your Honor, it's improper to refer to
the defendant as "Boss" by the government. If she wants to use
that in the answer, that's one thing, but to perpetuate that by
asking the question and framing it as "Boss," I object to that
as well.
THE COURT: All right. So you'll call him Mr. Guo.
I have overruled your objections with respect to the
form of the question.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you.
THE COURT: Let's go back.

(In open court)
THE COURT: You may continue.
BY MR. HORTON:
Q. Ms. Maistrello, do you recognize the people in this
photograph?
A. I do.
MR. HORTON: Government would move to offer Government
Exhibit UK723.
THE COURT: She needs to identify the individuals.
MR. HORTON: Oh, okay.
Q. Can you identify——can you say who the people are in the
photograph, left to right.
A. Yes. Boss; his wife; Yvette; and their daughter.
MR. HORTON: Government offers Government Exhibit
UK723.
THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Government's Exhibit UK723 received in evidence)
MR. HORTON: Please publish it, Ms. Loftus.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, where was this photograph taken?
A. In the dining room of the Sherry.
Q. Turning back to Yvette Wang, what exactly did Yvette do for
Mr. Guo?
A. Everything.
Q. What do you mean by everything?
A. She was his right hand.



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, I apologize, but I am having
trouble hearing the witness. If you could just ask for her
voice to be——
THE COURT: So you can bring the microphone closer and
also speak up.
THE WITNESS: I'll try, your Honor.
BY MR. HORTON:
Q. Ms. Maistrello, you said that Yvette Wang did everything
for the defendant, was his right-hand person. What do you mean
by that?
MS. SHROFF: Objection to the testifying by the
government, your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. So I said that she was his right hand.
Q. And my question is: What exactly did that entail?
A. From payments to giving directions to the staff.
Q. And who else besides Mr. Guo, if anybody, did Yvette Wang
report to?
A. Only to Boss.
MR. HORTON: Ms. Loftus, you can please take the
picture down.
Q. By the way, Ms. Maistrello, when you worked for the
defendant, where did you work?
A. Our office was located at 800 Fifth Ave.
Q. And where else, if anywhere, did you work for Mr. Guo?



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
A. In 2019, we moved to another office on Lexington and,
whenever it was needed, in his home.
THE COURT: All righty. It's now 11:30, and so we're
going to take our half-hour break.
Members of the jury, remember that you're not
permitted to discuss the case amongst yourselves. Don't permit
anyone to discuss it in your presence.
We will start promptly at noon.
Ma'am, you may step down, but do not discuss the case.
(Continued on next page)



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
(Jury not present)
THE COURT: Counsel, is there anything before we
return?
MR. HORTON: Yes, your Honor. Just one matter the
government wishes to raise for efficiency's sake. There was an
objection early in Ms. Maistrello's testimony about hearsay
with respect to a statement that Yvette Wang made. Yvette Wang
is a co-conspirator of Miles Guo. The Court knows she was
charged with Miles Guo. The testimony that was just elicited
made clear that she was also an agent of Miles Guo. I believe
Ms. Maistrello described her as doing everything for him and
his right hand. So we submit that statements made by Yvette
Wang in her capacity as Miles Guo's agent and in her capacity
as a co-conspirator in this case are admissible.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, I don't believe the
government has shown the existence——I can't see the Court. I
apologize. But I don't believe that the government has met its
burden under the hearsay rules of having established a
conspiracy with Ms. Yvette Wang and Miles Guo. There may have
been an employer-employee relationship that they've established
so far, but there is no indication that they've established a
co-conspiratorial agreement between those two individuals.
Additionally, your Honor, the evidence that the
government was trying to elicit——and I apologize if I have this
wrong, but I believe there were questions about what she was



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
asked during an employment interview, which certainly are not
in furtherance of a conspiracy. They are employment-related
questions.
Finally, your Honor, even if the government is said to
have established a conspiracy here, there is no relevance to
what interview questions she is asked. The government has
clearly established she got a job, and there's no allegation
here that she got a job based on fraudulent pretenses.
So for all those reasons, your Honor, I don't think
that the government's argument is properly made. Thank you.
MR. HORTON: Your Honor, there isn't a more
paradigmatic agency situation than interviewing somebody to
work for somebody else. Yvette Wang was there for Miles Guo to
interview somebody who was hired to work directly with Miles
Guo. If that's not agency, it doesn't exist.
MS. SHROFF: She was not hired to work for Miles Guo,
one, she was hired to work for Golden Spring.
THE COURT: One moment. Did Ms. Wang plead guilty to
conspiracy?
MR. HORTON: Yes.
THE COURT: All right. You may ask questions that
elicit statements from Ms. Wang.
MR. HORTON: Thank you.
THE COURT: We will reconvene at noon.

Q. What brand, if any, of suits did you buy for Guo?
A. Mainly two. Brioni was one, and Stefano Ricci was the

Q. And what was the process of buying those suits?
A. So I would get in touch with the manager, for instance, at
Brioni, choose some fabrics, then take them to Boss; he would
choose the fabrics for his next batch of suits; the tailor
would come either to the office or his home, measure him; then
they would make the suit and come back with the delivery.
Q. And how often would that happen during the two years you
worked for him?
A. That happened I would say twice a year. Once definitely
when it was Chinese New Year and one more time.
Q. How many suits were you buying for Guo each time?
MS. SHROFF: Objection. Mischaracterizes her
testimony.
THE COURT: On his behalf.



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct

A. I would say approximately a dozen.

A. They had, of course, pants and a jacket; they were, well,
in different colors or different fabrics, depending on the
season or depending on what he wanted; they had his name on the
interior pocket.
Q. And what name was on the interior pocket?
A. Miles Kwok.
MS. SHROFF: I'm sorry. I didn't hear that.
THE WITNESS: Miles Kwok.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, what, if anything, did Guo tell you about
cars he owned in China?
A. He talked a little bit about his cars. He was very——well,
he liked cars. He was very proud of his fleet of cars in
China.
Q. And what, if anything, did Guo ask you to do with those
cars?
MS. SHROFF: Objection. Is this all cars, some cars?
THE COURT: With his cars in China?
MR. HORTON: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
A. He had a few favorite cars that he wanted to import to the



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
US.
Q. And what kinds of cars were those?
A. It was definitely a Lamborghini and a Rolls Royce.
Q. And what exactly did Guo ask you to do with the Lamborghini
and the Rolls Royce?
A. To import them into the US.
Q. And ultimately were you able to do that?
A. No.
Q. Why not?
A. Because of import laws on——on cars.
Q. What year did Guo ask you to import his Lamborghini?
A. I think it was 2018.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, what is a hutong?
A. It's a traditional architectural structure, typical of the
capital of China, Beijing, which has a courtyard and then
houses surrounding the three sides of the courtyard.
Q. What, if anything, did Guo tell you about his house in
Beijing?
A. He——well, he was very proud of it. He showed some photos,
mainly of the interior, he showed photos of his artwork.
Everything was custom made in the home.
Q. And what did that property in Beijing look like?
A. Luxury property, like a traditional Beijing home but
luxury——a luxury one.
Q. And how many buildings were on that property?



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
A. There were like more buildings attached to one another.
Q. And what, if anything, did he tell you about who lived in
his house in Beijing?
A. He and his family.
Q. What was Chateau Ridge?
A. Chateau Ridge was a property located in Connecticut that he
wanted to purchase.
Q. And what, if anything, did you have to do with Chateau
Ridge?
MS. SHROFF: Objection as to the form of the question.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
THE WITNESS: Can I answer?
THE COURT: Yes.
A. There was a lot of back-and-forth for that property. I
think I started working on it in 2018, where he first wanted to
purchase it, so there were a lot of talks with the owner of the
property. We went there several times to check the property
itself and all the rooms and all the art that——that was in the
house. Some of it he wanted to keep, some of it he didn't want
it or he didn't need it. It was a quite long process.
Q. You said that "we" went there a few times. Who was "we"?
A. I went there a few times with him. Sometimes other
colleagues tagged along.
Q. And who were those other colleagues who went with you to
Chateau Ridge?



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
A. In several instances——in several different instances,
Yvette came once; I believe Hank also came. These are the
people I remember.
Q. What kind of property is Chateau Ridge?
A. I guess the easiest way to describe it is like a castle.
That's what "chateau" means. So it's——it looks like a French
castle. The interior——like, the interior of the rooms are
actually based off Versailles in France.
Q. What, if anything, did Guo tell you about why he was
looking to buy Chateau Ridge?
A. He liked it.
Q. What, if anything, did Guo tell you he was going to do with
the property if he bought it?
A. He was going to live there.
Q. Did Guo ultimately buy Chateau Ridge?
A. No, he did not.
Q. When you were working for Guo between 2018 and 2020, what
house, if any, did he buy?
A. He ended up buying a property in Connecticut.
Q. Now what did the Connecticut house that Guo bought look
like?
A. It was a very big house. I would call it a villa or a
mansion.
Q. And who, if anyone, lived in the mansion in Connecticut?
A. He did, with the family.



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
MS. SHROFF: I'm sorry. I just continue to have
difficulty hearing the witness, your Honor.

Q. Did there come a time that Guo asked you to buy something
for Mileson?
A. Yes.
Q. What did Guo ask you to buy for Mileson?
A. It was a motorbike.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, when Guo told you to buy suits for him or a
motorcycle for his son, how would you pay for these things?
A. It depended on the amount, so it could be either a wire
transfer or a check.
Q. And how would you get those checks?
A. I would ask Yvette.
Q. What would happen when you asked Yvette for a check for a
particular purchase?
A. She would give it to me.
Q. Where did those checks come from?
A. Golden Spring.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, you said that you bought computer equipment
for Guo. How did he pay for that equipment?
A. The big bulk of the payments for media and broadcast
equipment was paid through Saraca.
Q. What was Saraca?
A. Saraca was an entity that we used mainly for media and
tech-related expenses.
Q. Who was in charge of Saraca?
A. I don't know.



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
Q. How would you know whether something should be paid for by
Golden Spring or Saraca?
A. I learned with experience, so I knew that certain expenses
would be paid with one company and certain others with another
company.
Q. And who did you learn that from?
A. By working there, or Yvette would tell me, oh, this expense
would go under Saraca or under Golden Spring.
Q. And what other companies, if any, paid for some of the
things you bought?
A. There was another entity called Genever.
Q. What was Genever?
MS. SHROFF: Objection.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. It was an entity that was——was used mainly for personal
purchases or for personal expenses that related to the Sherry.
Q. And whose personal expenses was Genever used to pay for?
A. Boss's.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, who was in charge of Genever?
A. I don't know.
Q. Where was Golden Spring's office located?
A. When I started working, it was located at 800 Fifth Ave.
Q. And where is Saraca's office located?
A. So the official address, I don't know, but it was operating
from the same office, so 800 Fifth Ave.



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
Q. And what do you mean by official address?
A. The one that was, for instance, filed in the official
paperwork. I've never seen that.
Q. Who, if anybody, would you speak with to authorize an
expense from one of the companies that Guo——that you've just
testified about?
MS. SHROFF: Asked and answered.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. So whenever Boss used to ask me to buy something, I
would——at a certain point I understood where the money
should——should be coming from, and I——and I asked Yvette
directly for a certain amount of money from a certain company.

THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Government's Exhibit SM62 received in evidence)
MR. HORTON: Could you please publish it, Ms. Loftus.
Ms. Loftus, can you zoom in on the line that says
Approved by Max Krasner.
BY MR. HORTON:
Q. Ms. Maistrello, what did Max Krasner do for Boss——excuse
me——for Mr. Guo?
A. He was an employee of Golden Spring and he worked in
accounting.
Q. And what did his job entail?
A. A lot of payments. I know he was working on tax forms.
Q. And how often, if ever, did you interact with Max Krasner
at work?
A. Every day.
Q. And what would you go to him about?
A. Well, we——we were very close in——in the office, meaning
that we——we worked together, but whenever I needed something, I
needed a payment to be done, for instance, by Saraca, I would
go to him.
Q. Who was Max Krasner's Boss?



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
A. Go Wengui.
Q. Who else, if anybody, did Max report to?
A. Yvette.
MR. HORTON: Ms. Loftus, can you please go to the top
of this page that we're on and highlight what's up top there.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, can you describe what's at the very top of
your payment request form.
A. Do you want me to read, like, the title?
Q. If you could just describe what we're seeing at the very
top of this page.
A. Okay. So there is the company name at the top and then
there are——there is a payment request form, and then there are
a few lines that indicate the payee for this payment, the
street and address and the form of payment, with the amount of
the payment and the purpose of the expense.
MR. HORTON: Ms. Loftus, can you please take the
exhibit down and show the witness what's marked as Government
Exhibit 110.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, who's this?
A. This is Max.

O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
BY MR. HORTON:
Q. Now which of Guo's companies did Max work with?
A. Golden Spring and Saraca, mainly.
Q. In the two years you worked for Guo, how much, if ever,
were you with Guo and Max at the same time?
A. Definitely a few times a week.
Q. And when, if ever, did Guo tell Max to buy things?
A. About——can you repeat the question.
Q. Sure. When, if ever, did Guo tell Max to buy things?
A. It happened if Max was around him. It usually happened
at——when Boss had an idea and he wanted to buy something, then
he would ask the person he had in front in that very moment.
Q. And who, if anybody, would Max need to go to after that for
permission?
MS. SHROFF: Objection as to personal knowledge.
THE COURT: If you know, you may answer.
A. Yvette.
MR. HORTON: Okay. Thank you, Ms. Loftus. You can
take this down.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, who is Defeng Cao?
A. He was a colleague for the first few months while I was at
Golden Spring.
Q. And what did Defeng Cao do?
A. He would do security, security work.
Q. Who else, if anybody, did security work?



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
A. I would say that we had two separate teams, so we had
Chinese team and we had an American team.
Q. And how often, if at all, did you speak with the people on
these security teams?
A. Every day.
Q. What exactly did the security teams do?
A. They were doing a little bit of everything, so from
driving, handiwork, assembling, disassembling furniture,
receiving packages, these things.
Q. What kind of security work did these teams do?
A. Not much, really, in the sense that there was no need for
security, like, for bodyguard in this true sense of the term.
Q. And why do you say that there was no need for security?
A. I believe that there was no danger or threat posed to Boss.
Q. In the two years working for Guo, what makes you say that?
A. Nothing has ever happened in terms of security.
Q. How did you know what those teams were doing all day?
A. They were telling me.
Q. What was your understanding, if any, about why they were
called security teams?
A. I assumed that the word——
MS. SHROFF: Objection to what she assumed.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Do you have an understanding of why they were called
security teams?



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
A. Yes.
Q. What is that understanding?
A. The term security, security team, or bodyguard is better
than handyman.
Q. What do you mean it's better?
A. Well, it definitely sounds better when you need to hire
someone.
Q. And who, if anybody——withdrawn.
Turning specifically to Defeng Cao, what kinds of
assignments did Guo give him?
A. So at the very beginning, when we were still setting up the
office, there was a lot of furniture moving. He was taking
furniture from several storage places to the office. He was
sometimes painting the office too.
Q. And how long had Defeng Cao worked for Guo?
A. I don't know the number of years.
Q. And what, if anything, did you understand about how Defeng
Cao came to work for Guo?
A. From China.
Q. And what, if anything, do you understand about Defeng Cao's
relationship with Guo's family?
A. They were in good terms.
MR. HORTON: And Ms. Loftus, if you could please show
the witness what's marked as Government Exhibit UK728.
Q. Who is this a photograph of?



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
A. There are three people in the photo. Boss is one, his wife
is the other, and Cao is the other.
MR. HORTON: Your Honor, government moves to admit
Government Exhibit GX UK——pardon me.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, we have the same objection as
before. And I believe that the 403 analysis here would be
higher.
THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Government's Exhibit UK728 received in evidence)
MR. HORTON: And it's 728, just so it's clear.
Could you please publish it, Ms. Loftus.
BY MR. HORTON:
Q. Ms. Maistrello, who is the person kneeling in the photo?
A. That's Ho.
Q. And is the name you said the same as Defeng Cao?
A. Yes.
Q. And who are the two people in the right of the photograph?
A. The man is Boss and the woman is his wife.
Q. And what, if anything, was Defeng Cao's relationship with
Guo's daughter?
A. They were together.
MR. HORTON: Ms. Loftus——actually, please leave it up.
Q. What understanding, if any, did you have about why Guo
hired those security teams?
MS. SHROFF: Objection. It's not based on personal



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
knowledge, your Honor. Also, may we approach?
THE COURT: Yes.
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: I suppose that it's the government's
contention that they did not work in a traditional security
role because Mr. Guo did not indeed fear that he was in any
kind of danger; is that your contention?
MR. HORTON: We're trying to elicit——so she worked
with Mr. Guo six, seven days a week for two years. She also
spoke often with the people who were on these so-called
security teams. I'd like to ask——I did ask if she understood
why they were there. And I think the different question is,
did she understand, speaking almost every day with Mr. Guo, why
he had hired them, particularly when their tasks were different
than what the label might suggest if people were hearing this
for the first time.
THE COURT: You asked a question like that before.
MR. HORTON: So your Honor, I did ask if she knew why
they were there, sort of what was her understanding from
interacting with them almost every day for two years, and a lot
of the questions in this testimony are about what Mr. Guo told
her, right? She was working by his side almost all week,
almost all day for two years. I think it's relevant, if he
said anything to her why he had these teams, for the jury to
know why he told her that.



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
THE COURT: I agree it could come in. I just thought
it might have already been asked.
MS. SHROFF: Many times.
MR. HORTON: Well, with respect, I do think I was
asking a different question, which was from her own
observations, setting aside what anybody told her, what did she
see them doing. And now I'd like to elicit: Did he ever tell
you why he hired them?
THE COURT: Okay. That's fine.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, the security team was not
hired after she took the job. The security team was in place
for years before that. And there's no evidence that she's the
one who had anything to do with them being hired. It's also
very amorphous to say a security team. There's no indication
of who——
MR. HORTON: I didn't mean any disrespect to
Ms. Shroff. I was just trying to——
THE COURT: Go ahead.
MS. SHROFF: ——of who she's referring to.
Thirdly, your Honor, what Mr. Guo said to her about
why they hired a specific person would be also irrelevant.
It's not in furtherance of any conspiracy, so I don't know how
it could even fall under a hearsay exception.
But most important, your Honor, this is cumulative, it
is in fact not quite relevant to any issues here, and if he's



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
trying to make the point that this was all a big farce, I
believe the point has been made.
I just have to add one thing, your Honor. I'm
completely deaf in my left ear. I'm not only having trouble
hearing her, I'm also having trouble hearing him, even though
he's standing right next to me, so if you could please ask him
to use the microphone, I would really appreciate it.
THE COURT: Of course. Speak into the microphone. I
have checked with the AV.
MS. SHROFF: I know. It's my problem. I can hear
fine from here. It's this part.
MR. HORTON: I'll do my best to keep it up.
THE COURT: I will ask if there's any way of
amplifying the sound going beyond the equipment that we already
have.
MS. SHROFF: I understand, your Honor. I know you've
tried. I just am having——I didn't want you to think——I want
you to understand why I'm having trouble.
THE COURT: I will continue to try.
But I will permit the question. The objection is
overruled.
(Continued on next page)



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
(In open court)
THE COURT: So in order to better hear you, I'd like
to try the handheld microphone and see how that works.
You may continue.
MR. HORTON: Thank you, your Honor.

moving, assembling, painting.
Q. And you said that there were Chinese team and American
team. What differences, if any, were there between the work



O5T1GUO2 Maistrello - Direct
they did?
A. The——the Chinese team was in a way more trusted and closer
to Boss than the American one. The American teams were also
coming and going.
Q. And you said the Chinese teams were closer and more
trusted. What did that mean?
A. So there were things that maybe Boss didn't feel
comfortable sharing with the American team, or he wanted to go
somewhere he didn't want people to know, so he would
definitely——
MS. SHROFF: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled.
You may continue.
A. So he would definitely ask the——the Chinese team to help
him with those.
MR. HORTON: Ms. Loftus, you can please take the
exhibit down.

started to broadcast——for his broadcasts.

you work on Guo Media?

What other names, if any, do you know William Je by?
A. Only his——his Chinese or Cantonese name.
Q. What is his Cantonese name?

O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
Q. What, if anything, did you donate to the Rule of Law

A. I donated $500.

presentations for the keynote speakers, just a few months
really of organizing.

A. He said that he would be --
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, are we referring to private
conversations between the two of them? It's an open-ended
question.
THE COURT: What time? When?
MR. HORTON: Well, Ms. Maistrello testified that there
was a planning phase for some period of months before the



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
launch; and that she participated in it; and that Mr. Guo did
too; Mr. Bannon did too. I was asking her about conversations
in that planning phase between the three people.
MS. SHROFF: All of them over all these months.
MR. HORTON: Sounded like it was one or two months.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. Can you repeat the question please?
Q. Yes. During the planning phase, planning for the Rule of
Law organizations, what, if anything, did Mr. Guo say about how
the Rule of Law organizations would be funded?
A. So he said that he would donate the first $100 million as a
first donor or as a sponsor.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, as president and treasurer of the Rule of
Law Society, did Mr. Guo ultimately make $100 million donation?
A. No.
Q. And how was Rule of Law actually funded?
A. It was funded through donations that were coming from
followers.
Q. What do you mean by "followers"?
A. So boss had a pretty huge following, following base. And
those followers donated starting from 2018.
Q. Did there come a time that Rule of Law broadcast a
fundraiser?
A. Yes, that was the one-year anniversary.
Q. And where were you during that broadcast fundraiser?



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
A. At the office.
Q. Where was the fundraiser broadcast?
A. When or where?
Q. I'm sorry, where was the fundraiser broadcast?
A. At the office.
Q. And on what outlet, if any, was the fundraiser broadcast?
A. On Guo Media.
Q. What was GTV?
A. GTV was a platform for -- I'm sorry. I'm thinking about
something else. When I was there, GTV and Guo Media were
actually the same thing.
Q. And what, if anything, did the "G" in GTV stand for?
A. Guo.
THE COURT: When you refer to "the office," what
location?
THE WITNESS: So the first office we were at in 201 8
and early 2019 was 800 Fifth Ave. Well, in 2019, we moved to
64th and Lex.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, what, if anything, did you do to plan the
fundraiser?
A. Nothing.
Q. And were you present when the fundraiser was being
broadcast?
A. I was.
Q. What, if anything, was Mr. Guo's role in the fundraiser?



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
A. He was broadcasting over the course of several hours.
Q. And who were you with when you were at the fundraiser?
A. Initially, at the office I was on the second floor. And
then -- so with a couple of colleagues. And then I moved to
the first floor, where the actual broadcast was happening.
Q. Which colleagues were you with?
A. I was with Melissa, Max, and Yvette.
Q. And what, if anything, were you asked to do during the Rule
of Law fundraiser on Guo Media?
A. So we were asked to transfer money from one company or one
entity to the other so that we could take screenshots of these
money movements and broadcast them live on TV.
Q. And what companies were you asked to move money from during
the Rule of Law telecast?
A. It was mainly Saraca and Golden Spring.
Q. Who asked you to move money from Saraca and Golden Spring's
accounts during the Rule of Law fundraiser?
A. Yvette did.
Q. What, if anything, did Yvette say was the purpose of moving
money from Saraca and Golden Spring's accounts during the Rule
of Law fundraiser?
A. So the final purpose was to have these big amounts of money
shown on screen so that people would see that others were
donating, and we were able to solicit more money this way.
Q. Where did the Saraca and Golden Spring money that you were



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
asked to move that day come from?
A. I don't know.
Q. And where were you asked to transfer the Saraca and Golden
Spring money during the Rule of Law fundraiser?
A. At the office.
Q. I'm sorry. Where were you asked to transfer those funds,
from Saraca and Golden Spring to where?
A. Oh, sorry. To Rule of Law.
Q. What was your reaction to the request from Yvette to move
the Saraca and Golden Spring money during the fundraiser?
A. I didn't want to do it.
Q. Why didn't you want to do it?
A. Because those transfers were not real; those were internal
transfers. It was not real money coming in, so I didn't agree
with that.
Q. And what was Yvette's response when you told her that you
didn't agree with moving that money during the fundraiser?
A. She saw that I was upset. And she told me that, Okay,
don't do it; somebody else is going to do it.
Q. Did somebody else do it?
A. Yes.
Q. And who was that?
A. Melissa and Max were doing it.
Q. You said earlier that Rule of Law ultimately did nothing to
help people in China. What happened when the Rule of Law board



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
met?
A. We only met once as a board meeting in January of 2020.
And in that occasion, we discussed things to do or to be done.
But prior to that, we never really sat down as board members.
Q. Other than that in-person meeting, how often would you
communicate with other Rule of Law board members?
A. Not too often.
Q. What, if anything, did the board vote on?
A. Nothing really.
Q. Did there ever come a time that you cast a vote as a board
member in Rule of law?
A. Yes.
Q. What was Mr. Guo's title at Rule of Law?
A. He was sponsor.
Q. And what position did he have, if any, on the Rule of Law
board?
A. He didn't have any.
Q. Who was in charge of the Rule of Law board?
A. Boss was.
Q. You said there came a time that you cast a vote as a board
member. What was the subject of that vote?
A. It was in 2020. So after COVID hit, there was like a
proposal to purchase PPE and ship it to China.
Q. You said there was a proposal to purchase PPE. What is
PPE?



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
A. In this very case it was masks.
Q. What kind of masks?
A. N95 masks for COVID masks.
Q. Whose proposal was it for Rule of Law to purchase N95
masks?
A. Boss's.
Q. And where in that proposal were the masks? What was to be
done with the masks in that proposal?
A. So they were to be shipped to China.
Q. How did you vote in that proposal?
A. I voted no.
Q. And, Ms. Maistrello, after you voted no on Mr. Guo's
proposal for Rule of Law to ship N95 masks to China, what
happened next?
A. Our paralegal came --
MS. SHROFF: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, the government is eliciting
hearsay. We have an objection.
THE COURT: If you'll step up, please.
(Continued on next page)



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
(At sidebar)
THE COURT: So I need a ruling that co-conspirator
hearsay could come in. Isn't that what you're asking for?
MR. HORTON: It comes in under that exception, your
Honor; it comes in under the agency exception. She's
testifying about official business, the Rule of Law
organizations. Paralegal is a classic agent.
MS. SHROFF: The paralegal is in a conspiracy with
this witness and with Miles Guo to send PPE masks to China
without having established how that falls within the scope of
this conspiracy.
The statement they want to elicit is the paralegal
asking this lady if it was, in fact, a mistake that the masks
are being in China. Through that statement they want the jury
to conclude, of course, that there would be no reason to send
these masks to China. How the paralegal becomes a participant
in this conspiracy is unclear to me; nor is it clear to me how
this person becomes a member of that conspiracy.
THE COURT: I don't know that they're holding her out
as a co-conspirator.
Go ahead.
MR. HORTON: I would just say set aside the
co-conspirator exception for one moment. Paralegal is an agent
of the organization. The paralegal is also asking a question.
A question is not hearsay; it's not a substantive statement.



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
It's black letter that a question is not offered for its truth,
so it's not hearsay.
Setting that aside, this fills in the context of
testimony that's already been elicited that there was a
proposal to a specific thing by a specific person, and there
was a vote on that proposal. This detail is about what
happened at the conclusion of that vote and it completes the
story.
MS. SHROFF: Completing the story does not help the
argument that it is hearsay. She is not an agent of Mr. Guo.
It should be very clear. She is an employee of Rule of Law
Foundation. They have, in fact, established that he had no
position at Rule of Law. She's testifying as an agent of the
Rule of Law Foundation. And therefore, if they want to bring
this out when Rule of Law is part of a criminal action, then
her statement would fall within a hearsay exception. Here, it
would not.
MR. HORTON: Rule of Law is in the indictment.
Second thing is that she -- it's true that the witness
testified that Mr. Guo had a title at Rule of Law; it's also
true that she testified that despite that, he controlled it.
MS. SHROFF: She is not an agent of --
THE COURT: Here's my ruling: The objection is
overruled.
(Continued on next page)



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
(In open court)
BY MR. HORTON:
Q. Ms. Maistrello, you said that Mr. Guo did not have a title
at the Rule of Law Foundation?
MS. SHROFF: I believe she's asked and answered that
question several times, your Honor.
THE COURT: We've already established that.
Move forward, please.
Q. Did Mr. Guo have a title at Saraca?
A. No.
Q. Did Mr. Guo have a title at Golden Spring?
A. No.
Q. Why not?
MS. SHROFF: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. I don't know.
Q. Did Mr. Guo have -- withdrawn.
Turning back to your vote against the proposal to send
the N95 masks to China, you said that after you voted no, a
paralegal asked you a question. What was the question that the
paralegal asked you?
A. She asked me whether it was a typo.
Q. How did Rule of Law pay for those N95 masks that were sent
to China?
A. With the money from Rule of Law.



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
Q. Where did that money come from?
A. From donations.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, when else, if ever, did Rule of Law buy N95
masks with donor funds?
A. In 2020, so when COVID hit.
Q. And what did Rule of Law do with those other N95 masks that
it bought with donor funds?
A. So part of it went to boss's house, we kept a couple of
boxes at the office, and another part of it was distributed to
NYPD precincts around the city.
Q. Why did you vote against the proposal to send N95 masks to
China with donor money?
A. Well, because N95 masks were manufactured and produced in
China; so it didn't make any sense to me that we bought them
from China and then we would ship them back to China.
Q. And you said that masks were also sent to Mr. Guo's home.
Which home was that?
A. To the one in Connecticut.
Q. And when were those masks sent to Mr. Guo's home?
A. Around March of 2020.
Q. Who made the decision to use Rule of Law donor money to
send those N95 masks to Mr. Guo's home?
A. Boss did.
Q. You said that Rule of Law donor money was also used to send
masks to the NYPD. What role, if any, did you have in sending



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
those masks to the NYPD?
A. I was asked by Yvette to draft a letter to accompany those
masks. The letter should have read something along the lines
of: This is a gift from Miles Kwok.
Q. And what did you do when you were asked to write a letter
saying that those masks were a gift from Miles Kwok?
A. I told her that I could write the letter, but that I
wouldn't sign it with the name of -- with boss's name.
Q. And why wouldn't you sign it with Mr. Guo's name?
A. Well, because it was not discussed with the other members
of the board and it was not a direct gift from him, but it
was -- those masks were paid with Rule of Law money.
Q. And what, if anything, did Yvette say when you said you
wouldn't write a letter that said those masks came from Miles
Guo?
A. She told me that I was being paid to execute orders and not
to think.
Q. How much were you paid a year when you worked for Mr. Guo?
A. 60.
Q. What amount, if any, was listed as your salary on your
offer letter?
A. That was 90.
Q. And what, if anything, explains the difference there?
A. I was told by Yvette that the company preferred to pay a
lower salary on a monthly basis and a higher bonus at the end



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
of the year, that it would top it up.
Q. Including your bonus, what was your total pay at the end of
the year?
A. I believe my bonus on January of 2019 was 5,000.
Q. And including that amount, how much did you make in a year
working for Mr. Guo?
A. 65.
MR. HORTON: May I have one moment, your Honor?
THE COURT: Yes.
(Counsel conferred)
MR. HORTON: Thank you, your Honor.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, in your two years working for him, what, if
anything, did Mr. Guo tell you about his lifestyle in China?
A. In China, he had a lot of connections. He knew a lot of
people. When he talked about China, he usually -- he was very
proud of his achievements. He would -- he would often talk
about his hotel, he would talk about the staff there, he would
talk about the design, how he designed it. He was generally
very proud of it.
Q. And what did you understand Mr. Guo to mean when he told
you about his connections in China?
A. When he talked about his connections in China, he knew a
lot people, and so he would sometimes talk about what these
people did. He knew a lot about them.
Q. And who were these people?



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct

Q. And what do you mean by "minister"?

ministries.
Q. You said he talked to you about his hotel in China. What
did he tell you about it?

talked about his staff there, how things were run. He was

Q. And what, if anything, did he tell you about the status of
the hotel during the time you were working with him?

Q. Yes. What, if anything, did Mr. Guo tell you about the
status of his hotel in China during the time you were working
with him?

Q. What, if anything, did Mr. Guo tell you about when he came
to the United States?

Kong, so he was there first.
Q. And what, if anything, did he tell you about when he came



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Direct
from Hong Kong to the United States?
A. He left Hong Kong in 2015 and he relocated to New York.
Q. And what, if anything, did Mr. Guo tell you he was doing in
the period between when he got to New York in 2015 and when you
started working for him a few years later?
A. He was -- what he said is that he was preparing or getting
ready for his fight against the Chinese government.
Q. And what, if anything, did Mr. Guo tell you that getting
ready meant? What did that entail?
A. Mainly, he broadcast. That's what he did.
Q. And what, if anything, Ms. Maistrello, did you observe
about how Mr. Guo's lifestyle changed in the United States?
MS. SHROFF: Assumes facts not in evidence, your
Honor.
MR. HORTON: I can lay a foundation for it.
THE COURT: All right. One moment, please.
Go ahead. The objection is sustained.
MR. HORTON: Thank you, your Honor.
BY MR. HORTON:
Q. Ms. Maistrello, other than the broadcasting, what actions,
if any, did Mr. Guo take while you were working for him for
that fight against the CCP?

fight.
Q. You said that Mr. Guo asked you to buy things -- withdrawn.



O5TVGUO3 Maistrello - Cross
Ms. Maistrello, you said that you donated $500 to the
Rule of Law Society. If you could do that again, would you
have donated your money to Rule of Law?
A. With the knowledge I have today, no.
Q. And why not?
A. Because that money wasn't used for anything that I believed
in really.
MR. HORTON: Can I have one moment, your Honor? I'm
sorry, could I have just one moment, your Honor?

A. Work.
Q. What work?
A. Work at the office.
Q. Work at the office. What work at the office?

needed a translation, I would help him out. Work-related talk.
Q. And you've testified at great length about your
relationship with Yvette, correct?
A. I didn't testify to great length. I answered questions
that I was asked.
Q. Okay. And Yvette's full name is——did you call her Yvette
or did you call her Ms. Wang or how did you refer to her?
A. I——I used her first name.
Q. You called her Yvette, right?
A. Her Chinese first name.



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
Q. And was that?
A. Yanping.
Q. You referred to her as Yanping when you talked to her?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. But when you talked to the government about her, you
called her Yvette, right?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Okay. Well, let's talk about your interactions with her,
okay?
You testified that she was the one who conducted the
first job interview, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And when she interviewed with you, where were you located?
A. The first interview happened at the Plaza Hotel.
Q. Okay. And no reason was given to you as to why the
interview was at the Plaza Hotel, correct?
A. No.
Q. It was an everyday job interview, correct?
A. It was a job interview.
Q. Right. And you had been sent there by somebody named Steve
Weber, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And Steve Weber is a headhunter, correct?
A. I don't know if he is today. He was at that time.
Q. Right. And you filled out a job——or an application to get



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
a job through his company and that's what happened, right?
A. He had reached out to me.
Q. Right. And you testified about the second interview was
with Mr. Guo, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Now when you went to that second interview, they didn't
send you a memo or a notice saying you have a job interview
with Boss, right?
A. I don't remember that.
Q. They told you you had a job interview and the interview was
with a person named Mr. Guo, right?
A. I don't remember the specific name they used.
Q. So you don't remember if they referred to him as Mr. Kwok,
correct?
A. I don't remember, no.
Q. You don't know if they referred to him as Mr. Guo, correct?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Is it fair to say that they did not refer to you——refer to
him as Boss when they set up the interview?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Okay. You sent out emails as part of your job, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Internal emails, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And external emails, correct?



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
A. Yes.
Q. And you sent out external emails to agencies, correct?
A. What do you mean by agencies?
Q. Businesses, right? You sent out external emails to
businesses, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And you referred to Mr. Guo as either Mr. Guo or
Mr. Kwok in your emails, correct?
A. No. I would never refer to him as Mr. Kwok.
Q. Well, if you were emailing with that fancy place in Italy
about the furniture, how would you refer to him?
A. Mr. Guo.
Q. Mr. Guo, right? You wouldn't call him Boss in your email,
right?
A. I——I would definitely call him Mr. Guo.
Q. Right. And when you advertised your past job experience at
Golden Spring, you don't say, I worked for Boss, right, you
say, I worked for a man named Miles Guo, correct?
A. I don't really advertise. I never advertise his name.
Q. How about on LinkedIn? Do you say, I worked for a man
named Boss?
A. No.
Q. Okay. So the only time you consistently referred to him as
Boss is when you're testifying here or when you are talking
internally at the office, correct?



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
A. So I would call him Boss in Chinese when I talked to him
directly and Boss when I referred to him with my colleagues.
Q. And this courtroom setting is neither you talking to
Mr. Guo nor you talking to any of your colleagues, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. This is a formal proceeding, correct?
A. It is.
Q. And you referred to him throughout your testimony as Boss,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Now if I could have you recall your testimony about
Government Exhibit 102, please.
This is Yvette, correct?
A. It is.
Q. Right. And according to you, during your interview with
Yvette, she, Yvette Yanping Wang, asked you what your
connection was to CCP; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. Right. It's fair to say, right, you cannot be part of the
CCP because you are simply not a Chinese national, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. You cannot be part of the CCP without being a Chinese
national, correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. And Ms. Wang of all people would most certainly know that



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
basic fact, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. There is no way Ms. Wang ever asked you during a job
interview if you belonged to the CCP; isn't that correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: I'll let you answer. Go ahead.
A. She never asked me if I was a party member. She asked me
if I knew people who were party members.
Q. She asked you if you knew anyone who was a party member; is
that your testimony?
A. She asked me if I knew people who were party members.
Q. Did she explain to you what "knew" means?
A. What do you mean "knew"?
Q. Well, I know you now. That doesn't mean I actually know
you, right?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Don't testify.
MS. SHROFF: I'll move on.
Could you show her Government Exhibit 130, please.
Q. You testified about this building, correct?

Q. Right. 24-hour staff that lets people in and out, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You couldn't go up to that 18th floor unless somebody in
that floor said you could come up, correct?



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
A. Yes. My name was on the list.
Q. Exactly. And the only reason you could go up is because
your name was on that list, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And that was because Mr. Guo wanted to have security for
himself and his family, correct?
A. The security apparatus belongs to the hotel.
Q. And he's the one who puts your name on that security
apparatus, correct?
A. I don't know if he is the one, but my name was there.
Q. Okay. And is it fair to say that there is security
apparatus in that building 24/7?
A. I believe so.
Q. And there's security apparatus in the garage 24/7, correct?
A. That I don't know.
Q. Okay. And sitting here today, you have no idea, do you,
whether or not he picked that building because he wanted to
make sure that he lived in a building with 24-hour security;
you simply don't know, correct?
A. The reasons why he picked that building, he knows.
Q. Exactly. You don't know, right?
A. I do not.
MS. SHROFF: You may take that down. Thank you.

he was driven back and forth everywhere he went, correct, while
you worked for him?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor. Asked and
answered.
MS. SHROFF: I'll move on, your Honor.
THE COURT: You may answer.



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
Q. True?
A. He was driven.
Q. Okay. And you talked about how he was talking about some
Rolls Royce that he had in China, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. He never got that Rolls Royce from China to the United
States, correct?
A. Not that I know of.
Q. I'm sorry. What?
A. Not that I know of.
Q. Exactly. He would talk about it and then he would just
abandon the project, correct?
A. It just wasn't possible to import that car so——
Q. Right. And same for the Lamborghini, right? No Rolls
Royce or Lamborghini was ever imported here, correct?
A. Not to my knowledge.
Q. You could only testify to your knowledge. So the answer is
no?
A. The answer is no.
Q. Okay. Now you also testified about a person named Hank,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Now Hank came from China with Mr. Guo, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Right. And Mr.——and Hank speaks absolutely no English,



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
correct?
A. He does not.
Q. Right. And Hank used to live with Mr. Guo and his family,
correct?
A. They lived separately.
Q. You think Hank lived separately from the Guo family.
MR. HORTON: Objection. Asked and answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. You testified about Mr. Guo's son named Mileson, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You've never personally met Mileson, correct?
A. I did.
Q. Where did you meet him?
A. At the office.
Q. At the office where?
A. 800 Fifth.
Q. And what year was that?
A. The first time I met him was 2018.
Q. And when was the second time you met him?
A. Can you repeat the question, please.
Q. When was the——take your time.
A. Thank you.
Q. You're welcome.
When was the second time?
A. In 2019.



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
Q. And you haven't met him since, right?
A. I believe the last time we met was 2019.
Q. Okay. And he didn't ask you to buy him any motorbikes,
right?
A. Not directly, no.
Q. The question was whether Mileson asked you to buy any
motorbike. The answer is no, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor. Asked and
answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Mr. Guo didn't ask you to buy any motorbikes for his son,
correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. He did.
Q. He asked you to buy motorbikes for his son?
A. One specific——
Q. I cannot hear you.
A. One, one time.
Q. One time. And you never bought the bike, right?
A. I believe he bought it himself.
Q. I asked you if you bought the bike.
A. I did not.
Q. Okay. And when you say you believe he bought the bike, you
actually do not know if he ever bought a bike for his son,



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
correct; that's just your belief?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: You may answer as to whether you know or
you believe.
A. I do not know.
Q. You would ask Yvette for payment, correct, on things that
Mr. Guo wanted you to buy?
A. For bigger amounts, yes.
Q. And it would be Yvette who would have to authorize the
payments, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You had no ability to authorize any payment from any
entity, correct?
A. No, I only had a company's credit card.
Q. Right. My question was: You had no ability to authorize
payment at all, correct?
A. Authorize?
Q. Yes.
A. No.
Q. You could not say, Golden Spring is going to pay this bill,
correct?
A. It depended on the amount.
Q. Your testimony is that if it was a small amount from Golden
Spring that was being spent, you could have that paid through
Golden Spring?



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor. Mischaracterizes
her testimony.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. I placed orders through my company's credit card, so for
smaller amounts, yes.
Q. You would place the order, correct? Right?
A. Yes.
Q. The bill would go to Golden Spring, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You don't know if it was paid or not, right?
A. Well, payments go through immediately, through the credit
card.
Q. You don't know if it was paid or not, correct?
A. I'm not——
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Are you asking whether a transaction was
consummated or whether the credit card bill was paid?
MS. SHROFF: Whether the credit card bill was paid.
A. The credit card bill was always paid because I had the
money available.
Q. You mean the Golden Spring credit card has the money
available.
A. Yes.
Q. It's not your credit card, right?
A. My corporate credit card.



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
Q. Not your credit card, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Could you buy yourself something off that credit card?
A. Personal expenses?
Q. Yes.
A. No.
Q. Okay. Now you've talked about several entities while you
were testifying on direct, correct? We've already covered
Golden Spring, right? So let's talk about Saraca.
Do you have any understanding what Saraca was?
A. What I knew about Saraca was that all the expenses related
to tech or media went to Saraca.
Q. Okay. You don't know if Saraca was a holding company,
correct?
A. I do not.
Q. You don't know if it's a private company, correct?
A. I don't.
Q. You don't know where it's licensed or incorporated,
correct?
A. I do not.
Q. And then they asked you all these questions about some
other company called Genever, correct?
A. Genever?
Q. Sure. Do you remember your testimony about that?



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. You don't know anything about that company either,
right?
A. Structurally, no.
Q. Correct. You don't know who owns that company, correct?
A. I do not.
Q. You don't know if there's a board of directors of that
company, correct?
A. I don't.
Q. And you don't know where the money into that company comes
from, correct?
A. I do not.
Q. Only reason you could testify about it is because you
talked to the government about it in your preparation, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection. Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Can you repeat the question, please.
Q. It's okay. I'll move on.
Now you testified, did you not, that there were times
when you accompanied Mr. Guo and he would decide to purchase
something, correct?
A. Accompany him where?
Q. Well, you two worked together, correct?
A. I did not say that.
Q. Well, didn't you testify on direct that whoever was in



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
front of him would pay, right?
A. What I said is whenever Boss wanted to buy something——it
could be a TV, it could be a screen, it could be a monitor, it
could be a camera——the person Boss had in front of him in that
very moment, he would ask them.
Q. Okay. He would ask them to pay, correct?
A. He would ask them to buy. He wouldn't use the word "pay."
He would just say buy it.
Q. Right. And 30 minutes later he may change his mind,
correct?
A. He may.
Q. Okay. And when that happened, Golden Spring would pay,
correct?
A. Well, when he changed his mind, if he changed his mind,
maybe there was no need to purchase at all.
Q. Okay. Fair enough.
Now one of the other people you testified about on
direct was a person named Cao, correct?
A. Oh, Cao?
Q. Right. Is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And you testified——
MS. SHROFF: If you could just show her UK728, please.
Q. You testified about this photograph, correct?
A. I did.



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
Q. Okay. Do you know when this photograph was taken, by the
way?
A. When?
Q. Yes.
A. I don't.
Q. Do you know who took it?
A. I do not.
Q. You didn't take it, right?
A. I didn't.
Q. So the only way you could testify about this photograph is
because they showed it to you during your preparation?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Did you see this photograph ever before the government
showed it to you?
A. No.
Q. No, right? What's the answer?
A. I've never seen——
MR. HORTON: Objection.
THE COURT: Asked and answered. Let's go.
Q. You've never seen it before, right?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor. Asked and
answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. This photograph is taken at Chinese New Year, right?



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
MR. HORTON: Objection.
THE COURT: You may answer. If you know.
A. I don't know.
Q. Look at that red envelope in their hands. That's the
envelope given out at Chinese New Year, correct?
A. It could be.
Q. Right. And that's the traditional pose, right, when you're
before your elders in Chinese culture?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So that's a young man in a traditional pose getting
the red envelope from his elders, correct?
MR. HORTON: Object to the testifying, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: It's a question.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. You see exactly what you see, so you see two people sitting
on a chair and another person kneeling.
Q. And both people having red envelopes in their hand, right?
A. They do.
Q. Right. How many years did you live in China?
A. Five.
Q. Would you say you have some familiarity with the Chinese
culture?
A. Yes.
Q. And could you tell me what that experience of yours with
Chinese culture would lead you to conclude about this



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
photograph.
A. The first thing I would say is respect.
Q. Mm-hmm.
MR. HORTON: Is there a question pending?
MS. SHROFF: Well, her answer was "the first," so I
assumed she had a second point.
THE COURT: Is there anything else you want to say?
THE WITNESS: There isn't.
Q. And you testified about this gentleman who is seated on
his——I guess whatever posture that is, his——what is his
American name, by the way?
A. Wayne.
Q. Okay. And you testified that Wayne is dating Mr. Guo's
daughter; is that correct?
A. Right now, I don't know.
Q. Well, when you were part of the employment circle, he was
dating, according to you, Mr. Guo's daughter, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And he did work for the company, correct?
A. For a period of time, yes.
Q. He painted——
MS. SHROFF: You can take that down. Thank you.
Q. You testified that he painted, moved furniture, and did all
kinds of handyman work, correct?
A. In 2018, yes.



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
Q. Right. And what about in 2019?
A. He went back to school.
Q. Right. And where did he go to school; do you know?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Do you remember if it was Baruch College?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Do you remember what he was studying?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: You may answer, if you remember what he
was studying.
A. I don't remember.
Q. He was polite to you, correct?
A. He was.
Q. He drove Mr. Guo around, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. And when Mr. Guo was being driven around, is it fair to say
that there would always be two cars?
A. No.
Q. No? Could you describe for any one of——could you describe
for the jury what a car would look like in which he was being
driven around?
A. There were several cars.
Q. And each one of them had tinted glasses, correct?
A. Not each one.
Q. Not each one. Okay. And when he was driven around, you



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
said he had two teams, right? According to you, he had a
Chinese security team and an American security team; that was
your testimony?
A. Yes.
Q. And it was your testimony that you really thought, in your
opinion, that it was not a security team at all, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. So let's start with the American team, okay?
Do you know how many people were on the American team?
A. The number varied 'cause people were coming and going.
Q. So you don't know.
A. It could be as little as two, up to six——
Q. You don't know if there were ex-NYPD employees or not,
correct?
A. I know.
Q. You do know.
A. I do.
Q. Okay. And how many were ex-NYPD employees?
A. All of them.
Q. All of them were ex-NYPD employees, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Let's move to the Chinese team, as you called it. And you
said he was closer to them, correct, according to you?
A. Yes.
Q. That man is not fluent in English, right?



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
A. He became fluent.
Q. Really. You think Mr. Guo spoke English fluently in 2018?
A. Not in 2018.
Q. How about 2019?
A. A lot better.
Q. A lot better, right? And you're claiming under oath that
he went from 2018 of not speaking English to fluency in 2019?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. He spoke to you, when he spoke to you, in Mandarin,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. He never spoke in English even though you are bilingual,
correct?
A. He never spoke English to me.
Q. Right. And when he spoke to his daughter, who also speaks
English, he spoke in Mandarin, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. When he spoke to his wife, he spoke in Mandarin, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And when he got messages in English, he would come to you
and play them and tell you to translate, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. He did not know how to email, correct?
A. That I don't know.



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
Q. Did you ever get a singular email from this man, in all the
time you worked for him?
A. No.
Q. And when he spoke to people around him, he spoke in
Chinese, right?
A. He spoke Chinese to Chinese people.
Q. The reason you were hired as a translator is because he
didn't speak English, correct?
A. In 2018, yes, correct.
Q. And you continued to work, according to you, for him as a
translator in 2019, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. Now you also testified, did you not, about a person
called William Je? Am I pronouncing that correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And you liked William Je, right?
A. I did.
Q. You had a good working relationship with him, right?
A. He was not around a lot, but whenever he was at the office,
yes.
Q. You liked talking to him, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And he talked to you, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And he's the one who invited you to be on some board,



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Mr. Guo didn't invite you, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And Mr. Je is the one who talked to you about what
you would be doing on the board, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you had a choice, you could have been on the board,
correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Or you could have told him and said, gee, I'm not
interested, correct?
A. That is correct.
Q. Okay. And you decided that William Je's offer sounded
interesting to you so you accepted and you were on the board,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Mr. Je didn't tell you what he wanted you to do on
the board, correct?
A. He briefly mentioned investments, but nothing more than
that.
Q. Okay. And he didn't tell you anything about the
investment, correct?
A. He did not.
Q. He didn't tell you what type of investments they were,



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. He didn't know if the investments were coming from Abu
Dhabi, correct?
A. Not specifically, correct.
Q. You didn't know if the investments were in the billions of
dollars; according to you, you knew nothing, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Did you know if the investments were in the billions of
dollars?
A. I do not.
Q. And you decided you were going to be on the board anyway,
correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And William Je did email people, right, unlike
Mr. Guo?
A. Can you repeat the question.
Q. Sure. William Je emailed about questions he had, right?
MR. HORTON: Object to form.
THE COURT: Did he email you?
A. Possibly.
Q. Well, you knew his email address, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. You didn't email him and ask him any questions about



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
serving on this board, right?
A. No.
Q. Okay. And you decided that you were going to go ahead and
serve on the board, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And the only reason you decided you didn't want to
serve on the board is because that company got civilly sued,
correct?
A. I was not aware of that at the time.
Q. Right. But once you became aware, you were like, I'm out,
right?
A. I heard something, so I didn't have the details, but I
heard——if you want to call them rumors.
Q. Right. And when you heard, you wanted out, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And nobody stopped you, right, from leaving the
board?
A. No one did.
Q. Nobody said you have to stay on, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Not Yvette, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Not Guo, right?
A. Right.
Q. And certainly not William Je, right?



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. You continued to work there, correct, at Golden
Spring?
A. After——
Q. Resigning from the board, you continued to work, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Zero repercussions to stepping off from that board, right?
A. That is correct.
Q. Okay. Now you testified that you had responsibility at the
Rule of Law Foundation, correct?
A. I was president and treasurer.
Q. I'm sorry?
A. I was president and treasurer of Rule of Law Society.
Q. Okay. And what about Rule of Law Foundation, or are you
using them interchangeably?
A. No. That was a separate entity.
Q. So let's talk about Rule of Law Foundation, okay? For
them, did you take a trip to France?
A. Not——so I took a trip to France, but not for Rule of Law
Foundation.
Q. And who did you take the trip for?
A. I took the trip because Boss asked me to.
Q. Mr. Guo asked you to.
A. Correct.
Q. And he didn't ask you alone, right, to take a trip?



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
A. I was not alone.
Q. Right. There was an entire team that was put together,
correct?
A. Yes. Yes.
Q. Okay. And the team that was put together consisted of you,
right, because you spoke several languages, I'm assuming,
correct?
A. I was one of them, yes.
Q. Right. And who else was on that team, by the way?
A. There were four other people.
Q. Okay.
A. Four other security guys.
Q. Four other security guys; is that how you would describe
them?
A. That's what we called them.
Q. That's what you called them, right?
A. Four colleagues.
Q. Right. And these were all experienced ex-NYPD officers,
correct?
A. They were ex-NYPD officers.
Q. Did you know them to not be experienced NYPD officers?
A. I can't judge as to they are experienced or not.
Q. Well, you talked to them, right, according to you on direct
testimony?
A. I did.



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
Q. Right. And they told you about their experience as NYPD
officers, correct?
A. Sometimes.
Q. Right. And they told you what they did when they were with
the NYPD, correct?
A. They said some things.
Q. Right. And they told you they were investigators with the
NYPD, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. I believe some of them were detectives. I don't remember
their exact titles.
Q. And these detectives accompanied you on the trip to France,
correct?
A. We went together.
Q. Right. And what was the trip to France for?
A. So in the summer, in July of 2018, a Chinese national died
in France. Boss, Mr. Guo, believed that it was not an
accident; he believed that he may have been murdered. And so
he asked us to go there and find out what happened.
Q. And Mr. Guo thought he had been murdered by the CCP,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And you went on this investigative trip, correct?
A. Yes.



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
Q. You, four detectives, and then you went to France and you
met a lawyer in France, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection. 401.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. I don't remember.
Q. You don't remember the French lawyer?
A. I don't re——
MR. HORTON: Objection.
MS. SHROFF: I'm sorry. I didn't hear.
MR. HORTON: Objection. The question has been asked
and answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. And there was a whole investigation into the issue of
whether this man was killed, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection to form.
THE COURT: Could you step up, please.
(Continued on next page)



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
(At the sidebar)
MS. SHROFF: Sorry about that, your Honor. I'm having
a little trouble today with the hearing, so I will apologize.
I really am.
THE COURT: No need to apologize.
Why are we in France?
MS. SHROFF: I think she can hear me.
Thank you.
THE COURT: Okay. So——
MS. SHROFF: I think we're in France because she says
Rule of Law Foundation and Society didn't do any work, so I'm
trying to show they did do work. They investigated the death
of somebody they believed was killed by the CCP, so that the
truth would be told to the world. That's why. And she took
the trip. She translated on the trip. And I'm pretty
sure——and Mr. Schirick can jump in——that the government is
going to seek to introduce an entire video on the subject.
MR. SCHIRICK: Well, it's the Bannon video.
MR. HORTON: So the problem with the argument, your
Honor, is that she didn't testify——she didn't testify that this
trip was done under the auspices of Rule of Law. That's the
proposition that they want to establish, but it's not there.
And everything about this trip, all of the details that we're
hearing, are hearsay.
THE COURT: Did you ask the question whether she went



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
in connection with Rule of Law Foundation?
MS. SHROFF: I asked her if she——I'm pretty sure I
did, and I asked her who paid, and she said Miles Guo paid.
And anyway, it doesn't matter if it's Rule of Law Foundation or
Miles Guo paid. I'm not introducing any of it for whether this
man was or was not murdered. I really do not care about this
trip. There is no hearsay problem. And I'm not asking about
any statements she made. I'm asking about what she actually
did in France. That's——so——
THE COURT: If your claim is that the Rule of Law
Foundation carried out work in France——
MS. SHROFF: Mr. Guo also carried out work in France.
Mr. Guo had an interest in his capacity to show that what the
CCP was doing worldwide was problematic, and Mr. Guo worked
towards that. It doesn't matter——
THE COURT: So these are Mr. Guo's good acts.
MS. SHROFF: No, not good. Not good. Good is
immaterial.
Sorry. Go ahead.
MR. SCHIRICK: Your Honor, the factual narrative is
that this investigation precedes the founding of the Rule of
Law Foundation, and it's the work that they started that they
talked about during that launch video that the government
introduced into evidence yesterday, and the defense ought to be
able to argue that Mr. Guo, using his own resources, using



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
Golden Spring's resources, began the work of the Rule of Law
Foundation even before its founding. That's what this goes to.
It's relevant to the origin story of the Rule of Law——
MR. HORTON: Your Honor, if I may. I'm——I am
confused, and I think the jury might be too. I heard
Ms. Shroff say at the beginning of the sidebar that this was a
Rule of Law investigation and that's what——
MS. SHROFF: It was Rule of Law——
MR. HORTON: Excuse me, Ms. Shroff. I didn't
interrupt you.
I heard Ms. Shroff say at the beginning of the sidebar
that this was a Rule of Law investigation and then I just heard
Mr. Schirick say it preceded the Rule of Law. It's confusing.
The jury is going to be confused about why this testimony is
being elicited. I think that's reason enough to not elicit it.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, that's the pre——as he put it,
predecessor, predecessor steps to the formation of the Rule of
Law Foundation. This is the first step.
THE COURT: So once the Rule of Law Foundation was
formed, did they do anything in connection with an
investigation in France?
MR. SCHIRICK: That is the subject of the Bannon video
which is launch——the announcement of the launch of the Rule of
Law. It is a direct factual connection. They talk about it
extensively in the Bannon video that the government put into



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
evidence.
THE COURT: But did they do anything?
MS. SHROFF: They ran the investigation. And then
they publicized what they believed happened as a result of
their findings of the investigation. I really——
THE COURT: So you're saying after the founding of
Rule of Law Foundation, there was work in connection with the
French investigation; that's your representation?
MS. SHROFF: That's not what I'm saying. Not——there
was——I wouldn't call it the French investigation. What I'm
saying is, this guy was murdered. Mr. Guo took his own money,
started this investigation, and as a result of the start of
this investigation, it morphed into the establishing of the
Rule of Law Foundation, which they claim in the indictment is
part and parcel of the racketeering enterprise which is an
entity formed for no reason other than to fleece money, and
what we're trying to show is, this is how it started, this is
how Rule of Law got developed and what else it did. It's a
natural progression. And also it is because they are putting
in the video of Mr. Bannon——
THE COURT: Does Mr. Bannon say that the Rule of Law
Foundation is undertaking work having to do with this
investigation in France?
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes.
MR. SCHIRICK: Yes.



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
MR. KAMARAJU: But also, your Honor, the witness on
direct testified about preparatory steps taken to start the
Rule of Law. That's why they elicited it, when they had that
discussion, in order to elicit her statement that Mr. Guo
supposedly said, we're going to need a hundred million dollars.
So again, they already brought the preparation into it. This
completes the narrative.
MR. HORTON: First, her testimony was that she
undertook this preparation in September, consistent with the
representation, one of the two representations that this event
predated the Rule of Law, not that it originally started that
it was a Rule of Law investigation. But I think more
fundamentally, that this is a fraud case and this is now coming
in as he had this money before that he used on this
investigation to do good works looking into a murder.
MS. SHROFF: Not good works.
MR. KAMARAJU: I'm sorry. It's not a fraud case, it's
a racketeering case, at their insistence. Your Honor's already
ruled on this, when your Honor rejected their motion in limine
to preclude the defense from talking about any of the positive
activities of these organizations. Under RICO law, they have
to prove continuity, and if the organization was a legitimate
enterprise, then the test for continuity is different. So in
any speaking of the law, the fact that these institutions had
legitimate origin stories and had legitimate business afterward



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
is directly relevant to the racketeering charges that the
government chose to bring.
MS. SHROFF: It's not to the——
MR. FINKEL: May I respond, your Honor. At most,
there might be a question, which Ms. Shroff has already
elicited, about whether she traveled to France for an activity,
but what Ms. Shroff is endeavoring to do, it appears, is to get
into the details of an investigation about a murder of someone
who's completely irrelevant to anything alleged in the
indictment, that happened in Europe. So I think we're very far
afield of what the gravamen of this entire trial is about. And
while there might be a probative purpose for activities that
either predated or are part of the Rule of Law——which, by the
way, this witness says it wasn't under the Rule of Law. But in
any case, your Honor, that's already been elicited, and it's
time to move on. And that's our argument.
THE COURT: What more is it that you want to elicit?
MS. SHROFF: I've actually completely lost track of
the question. I don't remember the question anymore. I'm
telling you very candidly.
But again, what we're trying to show is the issue of
the enterprise that the government charged. We do not care if
this guy was murdered or not. Nobody cares. Right? And——
MR. FINKEL: So why ask the question?
MS. SHROFF: Because you have alleged——can you help me



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
out here. I'm sorry.
MR. FINKEL: If they want to ask, did you take a trip
to France as part of the Rule of Law, okay, but getting into
the details of the investigation is completely far afield.
MR. KAMARAJU: First of all, they've already
introduced the details of the investigation; not us, them.
They did it with the Steve Bannon video in evidence.
THE COURT: The Steve Bannon video, what is that going
to say?
MR. KAMARAJU: The Steve Bannon video, which is in
evidence already, through a stipulation that they put in
yesterday, says that Miles Guo launched this investigation; as
a result of that investigation, they are going to publicize the
results of that investigation; they're going to go after
financial institutions that enabled the CCP, and that that is
part of the mission of the Rule of Law Foundation. And that's
why it's been started. And they can say it's not in evidence.
They admitted it, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: That's not our argument.
MR. KAMARAJU: Hold on. That's not the point.
Whether it's your argument or not, we get to have an argument
also, and our argument is that the Rule of Law Foundation is a
legitimate enterprise that has a legitimate beginning, it has a
legitimate purpose, it has legitimate operations. And if we
can show that, your Honor, then that changes their burden.



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
THE COURT: So what I want to understand, though, is:
Exactly what is it that you're trying to bring out right now?
MR. KAMARAJU: Ms. Shroff.
I think it's simply——your Honor, I think it's simply
this is a real endeavor; this witness went on a real endeavor,
they went to conduct an investigation, it was real, it was
funded by Mr. Guo and the enterprise, that enterprise
ultimately culminates in the Rule of Law Foundation. The work
that is done prior becomes the work of the Rule of Law
Foundation.
THE COURT: So——
MS. SHROFF: How about this, your Honor. Maybe I can
answer the question. Mr. Guo funded this trip; Mr. Go funded
the investigation. And this was the precursor to the
establishing of the Rule of Law Foundation. How about those
three questions?
MR. FINKEL: She doesn't have any personal knowledge.
MS. SHROFF: If she doesn't, then she can say no.
THE COURT: If she does not know, she can say no.
They have a good-faith basis to ask the question, and so I'm
going to permit the question.
MR. HORTON: If I could just say one more thing, your
Honor.
THE COURT: Yes. One more thing.
MR. HORTON: I just want to clarify that the question



O5T1GUO4 Maistrello - Cross
is close to one——it's quite close to one that was asked and
answered, which is: Was this done through the Rule of Law? So
if there's a question that comes in that's close to asking her
to try again on that, essentially, we will object to it's asked
and answered.
MR. KAMARAJU: This is not the same, though.
MS. SHROFF: Really we should stop sustaining asked
and answered objections. It's not going to hurt the jury to
hear about that, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay. All right. Let's go.

what the goals and objectives were of the Rule of Law
Foundation.
