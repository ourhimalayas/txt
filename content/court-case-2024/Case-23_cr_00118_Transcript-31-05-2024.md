THE COURT: Good morning.
Please make your appearances.
MR. FINKEL: Good morning, your Honor.
Ryan Finkel, Juliana Murray, Micah Fergenson, Justin
Horton, who is on his way up — and feedback, sorry — for the
government. We're joined by Isabel Loftus, who is a paralegal
in the U.S. Attorney's Office, and Special Agent Robert Stout
of the FBI.
MR. KAMARAJU: Good morning, your Honor. Sid Kamaraju
and Sabrina Shroff, on behalf of Mr. Guo. And Mr. Guo is here
with us at counsel table.
MS. SHROFF: Good morning, your Honor.
THE COURT: Please be seated.
Yesterday the Court heard testimony from Steele
Schottenheimer, the managing director for investor relations at
Hayman Capital Management. The government seeks to elicit from
Ms. Schottenheimer testimony as to whether an investment in
Hayman Capital's Hong Kong Opportunities Fund could "have a
negative impact on the Chinese Communist Party," and be a means
to "fight the CCP," or whether such an investment is merely "a
bet on how the macroeconomic environment will perform." That
was from the government's letter at ECF No. 369.
Under Rule 701, a lay witness may offer opinion
testimony only to the extent that it is rationally based on the




witness's perception, helpful to clearly understand the
witness's testimony or to determine a fact in issue, and not
based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge
within the scope of Rule 702.
The parties have found some common ground in their
letters.
The government argues that based on her personal
experience as a Hayman Capital managing director,
Ms. Schottenheimer "should be permitted to testify that Hayman
does not represent that investing in something like the Hayman
Hong Kong Opportunity Fund would help bring about the event
that is being bid on." Government letter at 4.
The defense agrees that Ms. Schottenheimer "can
testify about whether she marketed the fund as a tool to take
down the CCP." Defendant's letter at 4, ECF No. 370.
Testimony about how Hayman marketed the Hong Kong
Opportunity Fund to Guo does not require Ms. Schottenheimer to
offer an opinion. Accordingly, Ms. Schottenheimer may testify
as to how she marketed the fund in promotional material, such
as the slide deck which was admitted into evidence, and in
conversations with the defendant and other relevant
individuals. The government may elicit, for example, that
Hayman advertised the fund merely as a bet on the performance
of the Hong Kong dollar. These representations would be
relevant to the defendant's state of mind in deciding whether




to invest in the fund.
However, I will not permit the government to ask
Ms. Schottenheimer to speculate about whether an investment in
the fund would have a negative impact on the Chinese Communist
Party. That question asks for an opinion that goes beyond her
work at Hayman Capital; it asks her to opine on whether a short
position on a foreign currency could have an impact on a
foreign government. This is beyond the ken of a person with
industry experience like Ms. Schottenheimer. It is also far
less relevant than marketing-related evidence because it does
not directly bear on the defendant's state of mind.
Accordingly, the government shall not elicit general
testimony about the impact of the fund on the broader economy.
I'm told that we're still waiting for one of the
jurors because the Lexington Avenue subway line apparently is
stuck. There may be some sort of a crisis related to someone
on the tracks.
Is there anything else that you'd like to raise?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, I just want to make sure I
don't run afoul of the Court's ruling. I plan to ask
Ms. Schottenheimer, consistent with what I understand the
ruling to be, about marketing and how the HHKOF was represented
to investors. I believe I can also ask her what the HHKOF is a
bet on, which is to say what it is. And that, in large part,




has come in.
I think she can also testify about her personal
observations about whether, after the HHKOF was made available
to the public in 2017, the CCP has fallen. She has personal
observations of that; that is not expert testimony. I just
want to make sure all that is in accord with your Honor's
ruling.
And with respect to the sort of -- whether the opinion
about -- if it even is an opinion, about the impact of the bet
on the CCP, your Honor, in some sense I think -- this is what
I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to get this with
Ms. Schottenheimer is if you bet on the Met game, right, and
the Mets win — which I hope they do, but they don't a lot — you
make money. But betting on the Met game doesn't make the Mets
win or lose, right; it's just a bet on an outcome. And I think
that concept, which she knows based on her personal knowledge —
not based on any studies she's done, not based on any work
she's done as an expert or anything like that, she's not an
expert, she's just an employee of the company — those sorts of
questions about investing and betting, frankly, because that's
what the investment is, I don't think that runs afoul of your
Honor's ruling and I just want to ensure that I don't do that.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
So I think the testimony that Mr. Finkel is trying to
elicit or that he refers to at the end is actually precisely




expert testimony. And we submitted an example of that from a
trial that was held here in this courthouse, United States v.
Phillips , which was about a market manipulation theory related
to the South African rand. And the government submitted an
expert disclosure concerning an expert witness that they
intended to call talking about the influence of trading
patterns on the underlying currency, how it would impact it,
and how ultimately that would affect the economy in South
Africa. So the idea that Ms. Schottenheimer can sort of
facilely say, Well, if you're just making a bet on the
currency, it's not going to affect anything underlying, it's
nothing more than a way to backdoor in the prior testimony that
your Honor has just excluded.
With respect to whether she can testify as to whether
the CCP has fallen, first of all, I'm not sure what her
personal observations about that fact are relevant to, but I'm
also not sure that she has the knowledge base to say one way or
the other whether the CCP has been damaged or harmed or hurt in
any way. The fund is still working.
So to me, what Mr. Finkel has sort of advocated for is
just another way to backdoor into the same opinions that your
Honor has now just precluded.
MR. FINKEL: So, your Honor, the difference between
Ms. Schottenheimer and the Phillips case is Ms. Schottenheimer
has personal experience, personal knowledge. She's a




percipient witness. She works at Hayman Capital.
The expert the government sought to introduce at
Phillips is none of those things. He looked at the evidence
and made an assessment about the evidence.
Ms. Schottenheimer would be testifying not about her
opinion, but about her personal observations, her percipient
knowledge of events, how the trade works. She tells people
about that. That's her job. And so I think that's an
important distinction between what defense counsel is
discussing and what Ms. Schottenheimer would testify about.
THE COURT: So I understand the questions that you'd
like to elicit. Would this investment have an impact on the
government and did it have an impact or did the government fall
as a result of this investment. Am I correct?
MR. FINKEL: That is one question, your Honor.
I think another question, which I can't envision how
it's in any way 701 or 702, is what is the size of the HHKOF,
right, which is the total position that the HHKOF has taken
over time. She knows that from her work. That's not an expert
analysis; that's her knowledge.
THE COURT: That's a matter of fact.
MR. FINKEL: Exactly.
And so that's all I'm saying, your Honor. Just to be
clear, I'm not trying to relitigate your Honor's ruling, the
Court's ruling. I just want to be -- I just don't want to have




sidebars and make sure I stay within the lanes that your Honor
established. And that's what I intend to do, is elicit facts
about what she knows, what she's seen, what she's experienced,
and then she'll be free to be crossed on it.
THE COURT: So asking about the size of the position
is fine. But asking whether this investment would have an
impact on the Chinese economy, that is prohibited. And asking
whether it did cause an impact or cause the Chinese Communist
Party to fall, that is also prohibited.
MR. FINKEL: Understood, your Honor.
Okay. Understood.
THE COURT: Anything further?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Just two things.
Defense counsel and the government have discussed I'm
going to provide Ms. Schottenheimer a binder; it has a number
of documents in it. We've identified the documents for defense
counsel. As at least to one of those documents, the defense is
going to ask for a limiting instruction because it's an email
that Kyle Bass sent to William Je; and it's being offered for
the effect on William Je, not for its truth. The Government
has no objection to such an instruction. And I guess we can
ask for it when that document comes up.
MR. KAMARAJU: That's fine with us, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: And then last piece, your Honor, and just




in an abundance of caution, I know the Court instructed the
jury about this during preliminary instructions. The
government would just request that in the sort of daily
admonishment to the jurors not to discuss the case, your Honor
also tell them not to do research on the case or follow any
news about it. I know that's sort of already out there, but
the government would appreciate if your Honor would do that
from time to time.
THE COURT: Okay.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you.
THE COURT: I'd like the government to provide me with
hard copies of the stipulations, please.
MR. FINKEL: Absolutely. They are being printed now,
your Honor, and we'll have them shortly.
(Recess)
THE COURT: I'm told that all the jurors are now here.
Is there something, Mr. Kamaraju, that you wanted to
put on the record?
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes, it's very minor. I've already
spoken with the government about it.
I just wanted the Court to be aware that when one of
the jurors arrived, they accidentally wandered into the room
that the defense team is using. They saw us, expressed
surprised, turned around, and walked away. Nobody said
anything to the juror, but I just wanted the Court to know.

I've spoken with the government; I don't think there's anything
to be done about it.
THE COURT: All righty, then.
Please have the jurors come in.
MR. FINKEL: Should the witness take the stand?
THE COURT: And the witness should take the stand,
yes.
(Jury present)
THE COURT: Please be seated. Good morning, jurors.
THE JURY: Good morning.
THE COURT: We're going to continue with the direct
examination of Ms. Schottenheimer.
And I remind you that you're still under oath.
You may inquire.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, your Honor.
STEELE SCHOTTENHEIMER,
called as a witness by the Government,
having been previously duly sworn, testified as follows:
DIRECT EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Good morning.
A. Good morning.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, you were speaking yesterday a bit about
the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund. Is there a shorthand
name that Hayman uses for the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
Fund?
A. HHKOF.
Q. And how do you spell that?
A. H-H-K-O-F.
Q. So if I refer to it as the HHKOF, you'll understand I'm
referring to the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund?
A. Yes.
THE COURT: Mr. Finkel, I'm going to need you to come
closer to the microphone.
MR. FINKEL: Yes, your Honor.
Q. When an investor invests in the HHKOF Share Class A, what
event needs to happen for that investment to pay off, for the
bet to win?
A. There would need to be a devaluation or a stress to the
Hong Kong dollar.
Q. And how significant of a devaluation or stress to the Hong
Kong dollar would be required for a bet on the HHKOF to pay
off?
A. Even one cent outside of the band, the fund would be
technically in the money. But the more drastic the devaluation
or stress, the more money the fund would make.
Q. So if the peg breaks, the Hong Kong dollar/U.S. dollar peg
breaks, would the HHKOF pay off?
A. Yes.
THE COURT: One moment.



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
Can you explain in very simple terms how this works?
THE WITNESS: Yes. So the Hayman Hong Kong
Opportunities Fund is short the Hong Kong dollar. And so the
Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar. And so if the
Hong Kong dollar were to devalue against the U.S. dollar, then
our fund would make money.
THE COURT: But what do you mean by "short"?
THE WITNESS: You can be long a currency and you can
be short a currency; meaning you can be positioned to make
money on the long side if the currency were to strengthen, and
you could make money on the short side, being short the
currency, if the currency were to go down in value.
THE COURT: Can you give an example using numbers.
THE WITNESS: Absolutely.
So the Hayman Hong Kong -- sorry the Hong Kong dollar,
for example, the weak side of the band is seven spot 85, $7.
per Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar.
If the Hong Kong dollar were to devalue to 10 Hong
Kong dollars to U.S. dollars, even though it's increasing, it's
actually devaluing because it takes more Hong Kong dollars to
make a U.S. dollar. So if you were to be short the Hong Kong
dollar and it were to trade outside the band $7.85 Hong Kong
dollars per U.S. dollars, then you would make the delta or the
difference between 7 spot 85 and $10.
Q. Thank you.



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
So if someone is shorting a currency, the bet they're
making is anticipating the currency will drop in value?
A. Drop in value versus another currency. In the case of the
Hong Kong dollar, because it is pegged to the U.S. dollar, that
is the metric.
Q. So if the Hong Kong dollar drops outside of the band, if
the peg breaks, the value of the Hong Kong dollar would drop
and the HHKOF would pay off; correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Now, that was Share Class A. Let's talk about Share Class
B, the Prodigious Series.
What event, if any, needs to occur for Share Class B,
the Prodigious Series, for that bet to pay off?
A. It's the outcome -- the input, meaning the devaluation of
the Hong Kong dollar, it's the same. It was just more -- the
exposure in Share Class B is more significant, so the outcome
is more severe.
Q. So, again, if the band or peg breaks, then Share Class B
would pay off?
A. Correct.
Q. Since the --
A. Breaks to the weak side.
Q. Since the HHKOF has been offered for sale, has the peg
broken?
A. No, it has not.



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. And when Hayman markets this HHKOF investment to investors,
what you just explained, how the bet will pay off, is that
consistent with Hayman's marketing materials?
A. Yes.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, may I approach the witness?
THE COURT: You may.
MR. FINKEL: Handing Ms. Schottenheimer a binder with
a variety of documents, including the following: GX HN-26, 29,
35, 41, 57, 59, 69, 70, 71, 79, 80, 82, 86, 98, 124, 168, 193,
208, 220, 221, 222, 223.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, can you flip through the binder and let
me know if you recognize the documents inside of it.
MR. FINKEL: For the record, those numbers are all "GX
HN" prefixes.
A. I have flipped through the binder.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, have you seen that binder before?
A. Yes.
Q. And how do you recognize that you've seen it before?
A. I reviewed this binder a couple days ago when I was with
the assistant U.S. Attorney office.
Q. And who asked you to review the contents of that binder?
A. You did.
Q. And who picked the contents of that binder?
A. I believe you did.
Q. And what, just at a very high level, is in that binder?



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. It's email correspondence between myself and William Je,
email correspondence between William Je and Kyle, email
correspondence between Steve Bannon and Kyle.
There's different versions of the Saraca subscription
booklet subscribing to the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund.
There's a Hamilton subscription booklet in here as well.
There's also some wire details, evidence of wires that
have occurred; as well as the side letter between Saraca,
Hamilton, and the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund.
Q. And Ms. Schottenheimer, the emails that you sent or
received, are those fair and accurate copies of emails you sent
or received?
A. Yes.
Q. And what is Global Relay?
A. Global Relay is a third-party service that Hayman Capital
Management uses to capture required emails and store them for
up to five years.
Q. And why does Hayman store its emails for up to five years?
A. We are required to by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Q. And with respect to the emails that you mentioned that
you're not on, what steps, if any, did you take concerning
those documents in the Global Relay system?
A. I connected with Hayman's chief compliance officer, Stu
Smith. We set up a Teams call so I could view his screen. I



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
do not have access as investor relations to the Global Relay;
however, he does as the chief compliance officer. And so he
logged into Global Relay and searched for these specific
emails, and I was able to verify that they were sent to
Hayman's server and captured by Global Relay.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, at this time the government
offers GX HN-26, 29, 35, 41, 57, 59, 69, 70, 71, 79, 80, 82,
86, 98, 124, 168, 193, 208, 220, 221, 222, and 223.
THE COURT: No objection?
MR. KAMARAJU: No objection to their admission, your
Honor, subject to the Court giving a limiting instruction with
respect to G HN-208 at the appropriate time.
THE COURT: All right. So you'll indicate when that
happens.
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, your Honor.
(Government's Exhibits HN-26, HN-29, HN-35, HN-41,

HN-223 received in evidence)
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, how long has the HHKOF been offered to
the marketplace for?
A. January of 2017.



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. And since that time, has the Hong Kong dollar peg broken?
A. It has not.
Q. Is the peg still in place today?
A. The band is still in place today, yes.
MR. FINKEL: Okay. If we can pull up, please, what's
in evidence as Government Exhibit HN-29.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is this document?
A. This is an email that I sent to all prospective investors
that had indicated an interest in participating in the Hayman
Hong Kong Opportunities onshore fund for Share Class B, the
Prodigious Series. I sent it on Sunday, May 24th. We had just
received the offering documents from outside counsel, and I was
distributing it to all interested parties.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, you said onshore. Can you explain to
the jury what you mean by "onshore"?
A. So the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund has two feeder
funds: An onshore feeder fund for taxable U.S. investors, and
an offshore feeder fund for U.S. tax-exempt investors and
offshore investors. These are, I guess, kind of tax -- it's so
investors, you know, get the appropriate tax documentation when
they invest in our fund.
MR. FINKEL: Ms. Loftus, can you zoom out of that and
zoom in on the top of the document, please.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, do you recognize this email address?
A. Yes.



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. And whose email address is that?
A. William Je.
Q. Could you read the email address, please.
A. William.je@acacap.com.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, why did you send this documentation
about the Hong Kong Opportunities Fund Share Class B, the
Prodigious Series, to Mr. Je?
A. At that point I was under the impression that William was
interested in reviewing both the onshore and the offshore
offering documents for the fund.
MR. FINKEL: You can zoom out of that, please,
Ms. Loftus, and go to page 3 of this document.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is this, page 3 of HN-29?
A. This is our AML or anti-money laundering information grid.
Q. And the second row says: Private corporation/limited
liability companies. Can you explain to the jury the purpose
of that row on this document?
A. Yes. We have all different types of limited partners that
come and invest in our fund in all different types of
structures. Sometimes it's as an individual, sometimes it's as
a limited partnership, sometimes it's as an LLC. And the row
that you're inquiring about is -- you said the LLC?
Q. Private corporation/limited liability companies, is that --
A. Yes, yes, private corporation and limited liabilities, yes.
Q. In the second checkmark it says: Beneficial owners, 25



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
percent or more interest, see CIP requirements.
What does that mean?
A. So we are required to do a look-through of the entity to
understand who the beneficial owner of the entity is.
MR. FINKEL: Go to page 5 of this document, please,
Ms. Loftus.
Q. And Ms. Schottenheimer, do you see where it says "ultimate
beneficial owner" above that chart?
A. Yes.
Q. Can you read what that says?
A. "Where no beneficial ownership information is provided, it
will be assumed no beneficial owner holds 25 percent or more of
the assets of the entity. In cases where the investing entity
is performing AML due diligence on the underlying beneficial
owner, an eligible introducer letter or equivalent
certification letter can be provided in lieu of providing the
details above."
MR. FINKEL: Can we zoom out of that, please,
Ms. Loftus.
Q. The chart below that, what is that for?
A. Those are four of the five -- that's outlining four of the
five items that we are required to collect on any beneficial
owner owning more than 25 percent of any entity.
Q. And what is an ultimate beneficial owner?
A. It's the person who owns the entity.



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
MR. FINKEL: If we can go, please, to page 9 of this
document. Can you zoom in at number 10, Ms. Loftus, please.
Right there is fine.
Q. Here, underneath where it says payment and a Citibank bank
account, what's that?
A. That is the account -- that is the banking account for
Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Onshore Fund. This is where
investors send their capital, that they're subscribing to the
entity.
Q. And so if an investor wants to invest in the onshore fund,
they send their money to a Citibank account which ends in 9681;
is that right?
A. That is correct.
MR. FINKEL: We can go, please, to page 44.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is this part of the documents for?
A. This is the accredited investor status. So we are required
for anyone who is subscribing to the fund to get verification
that they are, in fact, an accredited investor.
MR. FINKEL: And if we can please go to the next
page -- or, sorry, page 46.
Q. At the bottom it says "qualified purchaser status." What's
that?
A. This section of the document?
Q. Yes.
A. This section of the document is where we're collecting the



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
qualified purchaser representation from the investor. As
discussed yesterday, all of our investors are required to be
qualified purchasers.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is a sub doc?
A. A subscription document is the legal paperwork that an
investor completes in order to subscribe to our vehicle.
Q. And this document that we're looking at with the jury, is
that a sub doc?
A. Yes.
Q. For what?
A. The Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Onshore Fund.
MR. FINKEL: Ms. Loftus, we can take that down. And
if we can display for the witness, please, HN-33, just the
witness.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is this document?
A. This is a text message from Kyle Bass to myself.
Q. And the top text message, who is that text message from?
A. The top text message is, I believe, a cut-and-paste from
William to Kyle that he is then cut and paste to myself,
explaining what entities are investing in the Hong Kong fund.
MR. FINKEL: Government offers HN-33.
MR. KAMARAJU: No objection.
THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Government's Exhibit HN-33 received in evidence)
MR. FINKEL: Publish that, please.



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, now that the jury can see it, can you
read that first text message, which was the cut-and-paste from
William Je?
A. Correct.
"Because of tight timing, the entities to invest into
your fund onshore U.S., Saraca Media Group Incorporated.
Number two, offshore: Hamilton Investment Management Limited.
We can fill in all the details later. Thanks."
Q. And what do you say in response to that?
A. I'm asking Kyle if the text message is from William.
Q. And what is Kyle's response to you after you ask if it's
from William?
A. "Steele, these are the two entities that William and Miles
will be investing through."
Q. And what is your understanding of who "Miles" refers to?
A. Miles Kwok.
Q. At this time, on May 26, 2020, when you received this text
message, what was your understanding of what Saraca Media
Group, Inc. was?
A. I had no understanding. It was just the name of an entity.
Q. In your work at Hayman, is it unusual for an individual to
invest in a Hayman financial product through an entity as
opposed to their own individual self?
A. Not unusual.
Q. And why is that?



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. Because a lot of wealthy individuals use entities for their
family limited partnerships, for their business purposes. It's
just their preference.
Q. So here it says Saraca Media Group, Inc. Did you have an
understanding at this time, May 2020, whether Saraca Media
Group, Inc. was a media company?
A. No, I did not.
Q. What was your understanding about what Saraca Media Group
did at this time?
A. Just at this pinpoint with the text message? I hadn't
considered it. I was looking to collect the names to get
checks with our external counsel to see if they could help
enlist the side letter.
MR. FINKEL: We can go, please, to HN-35, which is in
evidence. 35, please, Ms. Loftus. You can scroll down,
please, to page 2. And if you can zoom in on that email on
Tuesday, May 26.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, this email that you sent to William Je,
copying Mr. Bass, what is the purpose of this email?
A. Now that I had the names of the entities investing, I was
formally requesting to William the AML and FATCA compliance
requirements for them to invest in the fund.
Q. And what was your understanding of why there was an onshore
investment entity and an offshore investment entity at this
time in May of 2020?



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. At this time I was unclear of that.
Q. Go ahead.
A. Outside of one being a taxable entity and the other one
being a nontaxable entity.
Q. And which was the nontaxable entity?
A. Hamilton Investment Management Limited.
MR. FINKEL: We can zoom out of that, please. We can
go to the first page.
Q. Can you read the top email that you sent, please, on May
28th, 2020.
A. Sorry, could you repeat the question please.
Q. Sure. Can you read this email that you sent to William Je
on May 28, 2020?
A. "Hi, William. We are looking to have all wires and
documents in by Friday, June 5th. Thank you for the below
confirmation -- sorry. Thank you for the confirmation below.
I will have the side letter to you shortly."
Q. What does "side letter" mean?
A. A side letter is a legal document that a lot of large
investors require. They are terms outside of the offering
materials.
Q. And was there a side letter for the Saraca/Miles Kwok
investment?
A. Yes.
Q. And what was the nature of the side letter for the



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
Saraca/Miles Kwok investment?
A. From a high level, they were requesting three terms outside
of the offering documents for the fund. The first was they
wanted a reduced management fee, from two percent to one
percent; they wanted a hurdle on the performance fee, meaning I
believe it was something in the magnitude of they were going to
make 25 times their money before we would start charging a
performance fee; and then the third is they had requested a
transparency clause, meaning they were going to require
additional reporting outside of our typical reporting to
investors.
Q. All right. Let's walk through that.
You said there is a reduction in the, is it,
management fee?
A. Yes.
Q. Can you explain to the jury what that means.
A. So for the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund Share Class
B, there's a onetime two percent management fee taken upon --
at closing. And so if you were to invest $100 in this share
class, the management fee for Hayman to manage this capital
would be $2 at the time of closing. So in the case of Saraca
and Hamilton's investment, it would only be one dollar.
Q. So the reduction in the fee, is that beneficial to Saraca
and Miles Kwok or to Hayman?
A. A reduction in the management fee would be beneficial to



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
the investor requesting it, because they are only paying a
dollar instead of $2.
Q. And can you describe to the jury, please, what the
reduction in the performance fee means?
A. So Hayman collects a performance fee. The performance fee
for the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund is first you get
your initial capital back. So if you invest $100, you get $100
back.
Then, on the next $100 that is made — let's say the
trade works out in our favor — we collect 15 cents of every
dollar, and you get 85 cents of every dollar, up until 100
percent net return to you as the investor. So you've made, you
know, $200 and we've -- or sorry, you've made $2 and we've
collected 15 cents at this point.
Then anything above 100 percent net return to you, we
split those dollars 80 to you, 20 to us.
Q. What did the Miles Kwok/Saraca investment seek instead?
A. They were looking for -- to make 25 times their money. So
if they were to invest a dollar, they would get that dollar
back plus $25. And then anything above that we would split the
20/80; 80 to them, 20 to us.
Q. And so the terms that Miles Kwok and Saraca requested, are
they beneficial to Miles Kwok and Saraca or to Hayman?
A. Beneficial to Miles Kwok and Saraca.
Q. At this time, Ms. Schottenheimer, May 2020, what was your



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
understanding of the amounts of money that Miles Kwok and
Saraca sought to invest in the Prodigious Series?
A. Originally, it was flagged to me 50, 51 million, including
Hamilton. And then at some point when we received the sub
docs, it was 100 million from Saraca.
Q. The last point with respect to the side letter,
Ms. Schottenheimer, you mentioned was transparency. Can you
explain to the members of the jury, please, what that means.
A. So we have typical exposure reporting to investors on a
monthly basis. We kind of quantify for them, you know, that
you are 200 times short the Hong Kong dollar or you're 196
times short the Hong Kong dollar. In Share Class B, it doesn't
vary month-to-month until the options expire.
But in the case of Saraca, they actually wanted
position-level detail, which we gave them, because there was no
withdrawal rights in this fund. And so once we were fully
positioned, we were comfortable giving them position-level
detail, which is what the side letter said.
Q. Can you break that down for us, please, what you mean by
position-level detail and because this was a fully invested
financial product.
A. Right. So typically, you know, again, we just tell you
your exposure, your short X amount to Hong Kong dollar. They
were actually looking for position-level detail, meaning the
actual description of the option. You know, you are short 200



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
million, you know, dollars worth of an option that expires on X
date.
Q. So they wanted detail about the underlying financial
transactions that --
A. Correct. The actual positions that they hold, when they
expired, the notional value of each of them. Because, again,
you don't just go out and buy a single option for a whole
tranche; you are trading with multiple dealers and getting the
best pricing possible every night that you're in the
marketplace. So you could have dozens of line items or dozens
of very similar options, and they were wanting to see that
level of detail.
Q. And this level of detail pertains to financial
transactions; correct?
A. Correct.
Q. And these are transactions -- these are trades that Hayman
makes to put in place a bet that if the peg breaks on the weak
side, the bet pays off; is that right?
A. Correct.
Q. And did Hayman ultimately agree to the reduction in
administrator fee, performance fee, and these transparency
rights for Miles Kwok and Saraca?
A. Reduction in management fee, yes. The reduction in the
incentive fee, yes. And the transparency rights.
Q. Who asked for those, by the way?



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. This was something, to my knowledge, that William
negotiated with Kyle.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, with respect to Saraca Media Group,
Inc., what, if any, due diligence did Hayman perform on that
entity?
A. Regarding their subscription document?
Q. Yes.
A. So when Saraca subscribed to Hayman, there was a thorough
review of the subscription document by myself, another person
that works with me in investor relations, and our third-party
administrator. And there was some time spent kind of
reconciling the answers and then inquiring back to William
regarding some things that did not align.
Q. And Ms. Schottenheimer, through that process, what did
Hayman learn about who, if anyone, was the ultimate beneficial
owner of Saraca Media Group?
A. So Saraca Media Group represented that there was only a
single person that owned the entire entity. And they put forth
that that individual was Miles Kwok's son.
MR. FINKEL: Can you please display what's in evidence
as GX HN-82.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is this?
A. This is a copy of a valid passport at the time of Miles
Kwok's son.
Q. And what's his legal name? If you could read it or spell



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
it for the jury, please.
A. His last name is Guo, and his first name is spelled
Q-I-A-N-G.
Q. And why does Hayman collect this passport copy?
A. It is required as part of our AML practices on any and all
beneficial owners more than 25 percent.
Q. And based on the representations made by Saraca, were there
any other owners of Saraca Media Group?
A. Not based on their subscription booklet.
Q. And Ms. Schottenheimer, if the Prodigious Series
investment, $100 million investment, that Saraca invested in
paid off, ultimately, who would collect the gain?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection to form.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Saraca Media Group would collect the wire, and the ultimate
beneficial owner of Saraca is Miles's son.
Q. So he would collect the gain?
A. Through the entity, yes.
Q. Did Miles Kwok go through an AML check?
A. He did not.
Q. Why not?
A. Because he was not listed on the subscription booklet as an
authorized signatory and ultimate beneficial owner or a
controlling interest person.
Q. In your work, does the term "principal" and "agent" have a



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
particular meaning?
A. Not in the context of a subscription booklet.
Q. In the context of what?
A. Can you please repeat the question?
Q. What is a principal?
A. What is a principal? Someone that is the primary person
on -- in some capacity.
Q. And, Ms. Schottenheimer, if your understanding that it was
Miles Kwok who was investing the Saraca -- making the Saraca
investment, but Miles Kwok's son was the ultimate beneficial
owner, can you explain to the jury whether that would be
unusual or why there was no work done on Miles Kwok AML?
MR. KAMARAJU: Object to the form.
THE COURT: If you would break that down, please.
MR. FINKEL: Certainly.
Q. You testified earlier that your understanding was Miles
Kwok was making the Saraca investment; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Why then -- let me ask it this way: The fact that his son
was the ultimate beneficial owner of Saraca, but you understood
it was Miles Kwok's money, can you explain what impact, if any,
that had on your thinking when doing due diligence?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection to form.
THE COURT: So take it in small bites.
MR. FINKEL: Sure.



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. The fact that Miles Kwok's son was the ultimate beneficial
owner of Saraca, as opposed to Miles Kwok, what impact, if any,
did that have on your thinking as you were working through the
due diligence of this particular investment?
A. I didn't find it --
MR. KAMARAJU: Same objection.
THE COURT: You understood Miles Kwok to be making the
investment?
THE WITNESS: I understood that it was Miles Kwok
family office that was interested in making the investment.
THE COURT: You can ask the next question.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you.
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. What do you mean by Miles Kwok's family office?
A. Previously it had been represented to me that William Je
was the head or ran Miles Kwok's family office. And so when
William Je was interested in reviewing our presentation, our
playback webcast in reviewing offering documents, I took that
to mean that Miles Kwok's family office, the capital that
William ran on his behalf, was interested in the Hayman Hong
Kong Opportunities Fund.
Q. And that Miles Kwok's son was the ultimate beneficial owner
of Saraca, as opposed to Miles Kwok, what impact did that have
on your thinking about the investment?
MR. KAMARAJU: Same objection.



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. It had very little impact on my thinking because it is
typical for family offices to have members of the family be the
beneficial owners of the entities that they invest in.
MR. FINKEL: If we can look at what's in evidence as
GX HN-41. If we can zoom in, please, Ms. Loftus, on the top
email.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, can you read this email from William Je
to you on May 31st, 2020?
A. Yes.
"Dear Steele, thanks. Please see attached the revised
side letter. Please ignore the previous one. As discussed
with Kyle earlier, in the interest of time, the funds may be
transferred to your bank account from a different company from
that of the registered investor. Thanks and regards, William."
Q. What was your understanding of what Mr. Je meant "the funds
may be transferred to your bank account from a company
different from that of the registered investor"?
A. So the registered investor was Saraca. Saraca had filled
out the sub docs. Saraca was subscribing to the Hayman Hong
Kong Opportunities Fund. However, in this email, he's
highlighting that the funds might be wired from a different
account other than Saraca -- or different entity other than
Saraca.
Q. And is that okay?



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. No, it is not.
Q. Why not?
A. Because we wouldn't have had AML on the company that is
sending the wire.
MR. FINKEL: We can zoom out of that, please,
Ms. Loftus. And if we can zoom in on the third email, May
29th.
Q. Can you read this email from William Je to you on May 29th,
2020?
A. "Dear Steele, please see attached our comments of the side
letter. We will have one onshore and one offshore vehicle.
The onshore one will invest 100 million, and the offshore will
invest one million. The address of the onshore vehicle is 162
East 64th Street, New York, New York, 10065, United States.
Thanks and regards, William."
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, you testified that the 100 million was
from Saraca. What was your understanding of what the $1
million was from at this time in May of 2020?
A. At this time I believe that I recognized that the 100
million was coming from Miles Kwok's family office, and the
million dollars was coming from William Je personally.
Q. What is AML?
A. Anti-money laundering.
MR. FINKEL: You can zoom out of that, please, and
display for the witness what's been marked for identification



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
as HN-43. And if you can zoom in this so Ms. Schottenheimer
can just take a look at it.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, just at a high level, what document is
this? What kind of document is this?
A. This is an email from me to William providing an update
kind of on our side, where we are with the side letter
negotiations, the timing of the closing.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, the government offers HN-43.
MR. KAMARAJU: No objection.
THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Government's Exhibit HN-43 received in evidence)
MR. FINKEL: And if we can publish that, please.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
MR. FINKEL: Ms. Loftus, can you highlight or zoom in
on the last paragraph, "Lastly."
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Can you read that, please, Ms. Schottenheimer.
A. "Lastly, the wire needs to come from an account in Saraca
Media Group's name. We understand that due to tight timing,
this might not be possible. As a solution, you can change the
entity making the initial investment to match the wire, and we
can transfer and assign the interest to Saraca Media Group as
of June 8th, the day of the closing. We will need to do full
AML on both entities."
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, can you please explain to the members



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
of the jury what you were conveying to Mr. Je about his request
to send the money from a different account.
A. So as I've previously described, we are under strict AML
guidance and requirements. Thus, you cannot subscribe to one
of our funds in a, you know, investor A name and send a wire
from investor B's account. They have to match.
So I am providing a solution to Mr. Je. If he can't
send a wire from Saraca's account to match the subscription
books -- subscription booklet provided, I am suggesting that
whatever account has the capital to fund the investment,
actually make the investment. So then we would do full AML on
that entity. And then after we have closed on, you know,
investor B making this investment, if all of the checks are in
place, then we could do something called a transfer and
assignment, meaning we could transfer and assign the interest
of investor B to Saraca as of the date of the closing. But
that would be post facto, after investor B, entity B, had gone
through all the AML checks.
Q. And when you say investor B would have to go through all
the AML checks, you mean filling out the subscription
documents, providing ultimate beneficial owner information,
that sort of thing?
A. Yes.
Q. And what ultimately happened? Did they change the name of
the entity or what happened?



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. They kept the Saraca subscription booklets in place and
they sent a wire from a Saraca account.
MR. FINKEL: We can take that down.
And if we can pull up, please, what's in evidence as
Government Exhibit GX HN-57.
Q. By the way, Ms. Schottenheimer, this period at the end of
May into June 2020, when you were facilitating this
Saraca/Miles Kwok investment, can you describe to the members
of the jury the pace of that deal.
A. There was a lot going on at that time. There was a lot of
interest in this new Prodigious Series. It was a reverse
inquiry from one of our largest investor from our flagship
fund. And, you know, we introduced this new product to our
current investor base.
We closed the initial B1 tranche closing on June 1st;
and so coinciding with me closing that 172 interested investors
that subscribed on June 1st, I was then also coordinating this
between Kyle and William, the Saraca and Hamilton Investment.
Q. And so as the managing director of investor relations, the
time you were interacting with William Je about the
Saraca/Miles Kwok investment, were you also handling other
potential investors and managing those investments?
A. Correct, like close to 200.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, this document is dated June 3rd, 2020,
and it's from William Je to you. Could you please read to the



O5VVGUO1 Schottenheimer - Direct
jury the first email from Mr. Je.
A. "Saraca will subscribe USD 100 million, and Hamilton will
subscribe USD one million in this batch. Please see the
attached signature pages of the onshore Saraca fund document
you sent earlier and the relevant KYC documents for your
review. Please confirm all is in order and we will arrange
remittance. The offshore Hamilton documents will follow."
(Continued on next page)



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. And Ms. Schottenheimer, at a high level, what is attached
to this email?
A. These are the subscription documents for Saraca to invest
in Hayman Hong Kong Opportunity Onshore Fund Share Class B.
MR. FINKEL: Ms. Loftus, could we go to page 4 of this
document, please.
Stop right there.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is this page?
A. This is the signature page to the subscription booklet.
Q. And who signed for Saraca Media Group, Inc.?
A. Yanping Wang.
Q. With what title?
A. President.
Q. What does it say next to Total Requested Capital
Contributions?
A. $100 million.
Q. And what does that mean, total requested capital
contributions, layman's terms?
A. The amount that they're subscribing or investing in the
fund.
Q. At this time, June 3, 2020, did you know who Yanping Wang
is?
A. I did not.
MR. FINKEL: Could we go to page 6, Ms. Loftus.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is this page, Investor Profile?
A. This is a page of the subscription booklet that collects
information on the investor.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, underneath the Capital Contribution,
100 million, or two lines below it, what does it say?
A. Two lines below the Capital Contribution?
Q. Yes, ma'am.
A. "Briefly identify the subscriber's primary source of
wealth."
Q. And why does Hayman collect that information?
A. This is an AML requirement.
Q. And what information is provided by Saraca about their
primary source of wealth?
A. On their first pass of the subscription document, it was
left blank.
Q. And is that acceptable for Hayman's purposes?
A. No.
Q. And below that, Entity Investors, it says there's a
registered office address in Delaware and a principal place of
business on 64th Street in Manhattan. What's the difference
between a registered office address and a principal place of
business address?
A. Principal place is of business is where——is the primary
place where the majority of the business of this entity takes
place. The registered office is where the entity was formed



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
and registered.
MR. FINKEL: Could we go to page 8, please,
Ms. Loftus.
Actually, page 7. Sorry.
Q. The bottom, or the second line of page 7,
Ms. Schottenheimer, it says, "Total number of equity/capital/or
beneficial owners of the investor." What does that mean?
A. So this is an entity, and we are trying to understand how
many individuals own this entity.
Q. And what's the information provided?
A. That there is one owner of this entity.
Q. And which entity is this?
A. Saraca Media Group, Incorporated.
Q. And at this time what was your understanding of who the one
entity or owner of this Saraca Media Group was?
A. Miles Kwok Sun.
MR. FINKEL: Ms. Loftus, we can go to page 8 now,
please. Sorry about that.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is the information that is being
provided on page 8 of HN57?
A. We need authorized contacts to know who is authorized to
receive information regarding this investment, and there is a
primary contact and a secondary contact listed.
Q. And who is the primary contact?
A. Yanping Wang.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. And who is the secondary contact?
A. Max Krasner.
Q. And at this time, Ms. Schottenheimer, did you know who Max
Krasner was?
A. I did not.
Q. In your work at Hayman, is it unusual to see contacts that
are different than your understanding of who is the family
office investing in a project?
MR. KAMARAJU: Object to form.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. There's an industry term called segregation of duties, and
this is a best in practice kind of governance over kind of
institutional practices, and so it is very common that the
person making the investment decisions is different than the
authorized signatory on the account, and that is, you
know——there's additional contacts receiving information of
the——of the investment.
MR. FINKEL: We can go to page 11, please, Ms. Loftus.
Q. It says here the authorized signatory is Yanping Wang.
Similar question: Is it unusual to see an individual as an
authorized signatory who is different than the ultimate
beneficial owner in the family office?
A. This is not unusual.
Q. Why not?
A. Like I previously said, this is segregation of duties.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
This is kind of more eyes watching the investment, watching
over what's going on, and this is very typical for
institutional quality investments.
MR. FINKEL: If we can go page 29, please, Ms. Loftus.
Sorry. Page 46. Excuse me.
If we can go to page 49.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is this document, page 49 of HN57?
A. This is a valid government-issued ID. It's a passport of
Yanping Wang's passport.
Q. And why is it something that Hayman collected?
A. As the authorized signatory of Saraca Media Group, we were
required to collect this document as part of our AML check.
MR. FINKEL: Could we go to the next page, please,
Ms. Loftus.
If we can go to page 53.
You can take that down.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, given that the source of wealth
information was left blank, what, if anything, did you convey
to Mr. Je about that?
A. There was a number of blanks within the subdoc that I
needed complete and so I requested to him to complete the
outstanding information.
MR. FINKEL: If we can pull up, please, HN69.
Q. Now separate from the Saraca investment, was Hayman also
collecting materials for the Hamilton investment?



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. Yes.
Q. And what is this document, HN69?
A. This is the subscription packet that Hamilton is submitting
for processing for subscription to Hayman Hong Kong
Opportunities Offshore Fund.
Q. And was Hamilton going to get the same side letter
agreement that Saraca got?
A. Yes, it was negotiated simultaneously.
MR. FINKEL: If we can pull up, please, Ms. Loftus
HN71.
If we can zoom in on the top email, please.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, this document HN71 is dated June 4,
2020. Can you review it and let the members of the jury know
the purpose of you sending this email to Mr. Je.
A. Mr. Je had requested countersigned, or counterexecuted
subscription——subscription booklets for both Saraca and
Hamilton. This is sometimes a practice that in order to——for a
bank to send a wire, they want to see that there's an actual
agreement or deal in place for the fund that they're
subscribing. There was a handful of outstanding questions on
the Saraca document, but none that were AML related, and so we
were comfortable signing the subscription booklet with just
a——a handful of outstanding questions to be made.
Q. But when Hayman had signed the subscription booklet, had
Saraca provided information about the source of funds?




O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. Yes, they had.
MR. FINKEL: Could we go to page 31 of this document,
Ms. Loftus.
Q. And can you read, Ms. Schottenheimer, what's below "Briefly
identify the subscriber's primary source of wealth."
A. Selling shares of a subsidiary.
Q. And at this time, do you have any idea what that meant?
A. Not specifically.
MR. FINKEL: You can take that down.
And if we can go to HN79, which is in evidence.
And can you zoom in on the bottom email, please,
Ms. Loftus.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, can you read this email dated June 5,
2020, from you to William Je.
A. Hi William. I am pleased to report we have received the
$100 million wire from Saraca. Please advise on Hamilton's
wire at your earliest convenience. Thank you.
Q. And did in fact Hayman receive a hundred million dollars
from Saraca?
A. Yes.
Q. And did Hayman later receive the million dollars from
Hamilton?

Q. Do you recognize this document, Ms. Schottenheimer?
A. Yes.
Q. Can you explain to the jury what HN124 is.
A. It's an email between William and I. I had received a
strange email from a strange email address asking that, need to
verify that if "Karl" Bass was one of the directors of Saraca
Media Group. So I cut and paste this strange email that I've
got, had received, to William, and I say, Hi William, I am
going to ignore the below unless otherwise directed by you. In
which he responds, Please ignore the email as most of these are
scams. Thanks.
MR. FINKEL: We can take that down.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, I want to direct your attention to
July 13, 2020. What, if anything, happened with respect to the
Saraca investment on that date?
A. Hayman received a call from outside counsel, our lawyer,
that they had received a letter from the SEC for a
documentation request regarding Saraca's investment in the
Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. What was the name of that attorney?

Q. And how is it that you remember that particular date,

dinner.
Q. Did you cook her dinner?
A. At like 9 p.m.
Q. Why was it so delayed?
A. There was a lot of calls, internally at Hayman and with
external counsel.
Q. About what general topic matter?
A. About Saraca's investment in the Hayman fund and this
document request that we had received.
Q. And what sort of documents was the SEC requesting from
Hayman?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection to form, your Honor.
THE COURT: Did they request any documents?
A. They requested a number of documents.
Q. What kind of documents did the SEC request?
A. The ones that I had to run point on gathering was the
subscription documents.
Q. Subscription documents for——of what?



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. Of Saraca investing in the Hong Kong fund, AML that went
along with it.
Q. And upon receiving this request for documents from the SEC,
after that, what, if any, steps did Hayman take as a result of
this notification?
A. At this point we were being advised by external counsel and
they were running point on the process, but as a next step, my
recollection was that we segregated the Saraca investment in
its own tranche so it wasn't commingled with any other
investors, so Saraca stayed in B2 and the other investors we
moved out to different tranches, and then we, from there,
had——$30 million of the hundred million had been invested in
options shorting the Hong Kong dollar, and then we had roughly
7 million——$70 million that was still in cash, and we kind of
segregated these two buckets of the Saraca investment because
it had been brought to our attention that 70 million of the
hundred million was potentially not from Saraca.
Q. Did Hayman's attorneys contact Saraca?
A. Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection to form.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Yes.
MR. FINKEL: If we can display what's in evidence as
HN168.
If you can zoom in at the top through the Kit



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
Addleman. Yup.
Q. What is the date of this email, Ms. Schottenheimer?
A. Wednesday, July 15th.
Q. What is the text of it?
A. Please see the attached letter requiring your prompt
attention. Thank you, Kit Addleman.
Q. And who, if anyone, did Ms. Addleman send this email to?
A. William Je, Max K, Yvette Wang, aaron@lmesq.com.
MR. FINKEL: Zoom out of that, and let's go to the
next page, please.
Q. And Ms. Schottenheimer, what was your understanding of why
Ms. Addleman sent this letter to William Je, Max Krasner,
Yvette Wang, and Aaron Mitchell?
A. We were under——we were trying to understand where the
source of funds came for for the Saraca investment, and we were
trying to understand what to do with the investment going
forward.
Q. Can you read the first paragraph of this letter.
A. Haynes and Boone, LLP represents Hayman Capital Management
and Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Onshore Fund. We have been
contacted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission related
to an investigation of a securities offering by GTV Media Group
entitled in the matter of G Coins (NY-10256). As a result we
require your immediate attention and additional information.
Q. And at this time, Ms. Schottenheimer, July 15, 2020, what



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
was your understanding of what GTV Media Group was?
A. It was an entity run and operated by Miles Kwok.
Q. And what was your understanding of what G Coins was?
A. It was an offering that GTV was——it was a private placement
offering that GTV Media Group offered, presented.
Q. What's a private placement?
A. A private placement is a private fund that is not offered
on an exchange.
Q. Can you read the next paragraph.
A. As the general partner to the fund and in the performance
of its continuing due diligence and compliance with the
securities laws, Hayman requires your response to the
following:
Q. Can you read the first question.
A. What was the source of capital used by Saraca Media Group
to invest in the fund?
Q. Can you read the next question.
A. The fund's subscription agreement contemplated——sorry——the
fund's subscription agreement completed on behalf of Saraca
listed the company's primary source of wealth as selling shares
of subsidiary. What subsidiary is this statement referring to,
when were the shares of the subsidiary acquired, and when were
the shares sold?
Q. Could you read the next one.
A. If the proceeds were derived from a securities offering,



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
did the offering documents disclose the use of proceeds to
include an investment in the fund or in any similar private
vehicle? If yes, please provide a copy of the disclosure
document.
Q. Can you read the next one.
A. Was any of the money raised in GTV's primary offering of
shares used to fund Saraca's investment in the fund?
Q. And the next one?
A. For the primary offering funds raised by GTV, into what
banks were the proceeds deposited and what was the balance in
those accounts as of July 9, 2020?
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, did anyone from Saraca Media respond to
these questions?
A. No.
Q. The third question, it says: "If the proceeds were derived
from a securities offering, did the offering documents disclose
the use of proceeds to include an investment in the fund or in
any similar private fund vehicle?"
What is your understanding of what offering documents
means?
A. Well, a private placement is something that an investor
subscribes to, and you have to offer them the interest or the
option to invest in the fund, so there would be offering
documents just like we have offering documents for the Hayman
Hong Kong Opportunities Fund.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
MR. FINKEL: Can you zoom out, Ms. Loftus, and go to
the next page, please.
Q. Can you read the second sentence of the first paragraph.
A. Thank you for your prompt assistance in this matter. If
you have questions regarding this request, please contact me at
this email address and phone number below.
Q. And above that, it says, "However, to remain an investor in
the fund, we require responses to the above questions by 9 a.m.
Central Time on Friday, July 17"?
A. Yes.
Q. Were those responses provided?
A. They were not.
Q. Did Hayman receive any response after dispatching this
letter?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: I can rephrase.
Q. What, if any, response did Hayman receive after dispatching
this letter?
A. No formal responses to this letter.
Q. What about informal responses?
A. It's my understanding that Kyle and William had connected
over the phone.
Q. And what is your understanding of what that communication
was?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection. Hearsay.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
THE COURT: If you'll step up, please.
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: So for what purpose are you eliciting
these out-of-court statements?
MR. FINKEL: So there are two points to it. One, your
Honor, it's a statement of William Je, which is a
co-conspirator statement; and second, it's being offered to
show the effect on the listener, which here is
Ms. Schottenheimer, because it informs what she and others at
Hayman subsequently did with respect to the Saraca investment.
THE COURT: The objection is overruled.
(Continued on next page)



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
(In open court)
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Can you please repeat the question.
Q. What was your understanding of what was conveyed to
Mr. Bass by Mr. Je?
A. That there was a misunderstanding, there might have been
some money borrowed but they were going to put it back, and to
keep investing the money, and they wanted to stay invested in
the Hayman Capital Hong Kong Fund.
Q. I'm sorry?
A. The Hayman Capital Hong Kong Fund.
Q. Was that explanation sufficient for Hayman?
A. No.
MR. FINKEL: If we can please display what's in
evidence as HN193.
If you can zoom in on this.
Q. This is a document from——this is an email from William Je
to Kyle Bass; is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. July 24, 2020?
A. Yes.
Q. Can you read what William Je told Mr. Bass.
A. Dear Kyle, How are you? Saraca has asked me to inform you
that their investments into your fund is valid and approved by
your fund previously. Saraca does not agree for any refund of



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
the money to Saraca or your fund may need to bear any
consequences of such refund including any economic
consequences. Thanks and best regards, William.
Q. Was Hayman contemplating ejecting Saraca from the HHKOF at
this time?
A. Yes.
Q. Why was that?
A. Because it had been brought to our attention that the funds
for the investment might not have come from Saraca.
MR. FINKEL: If we can please pull up what's in
evidence as HN221.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, do you recognize this document?
A. Yes.
Q. Could you explain to the jury what this email is.
A. This is our lawyer, Kit Addleman, sending notice to Saraca
and its counsel that Hayman, as the general partner of the
Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Onshore Fund, is exercising its
right to make a mandatory withdrawal of $70 million of the
investment made by Saraca Media Group.
Q. And what does that mean, if you can explain to the jury, of
a mandatory withdrawal of 70 million?
A. The GP of the fund, the general partner of the fund,
reserves the right to exercise its ability to do a mandatory
withdrawal for——of an investor.
Q. And what's mandatory withdrawal?



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. Forcing them to——it's a forced redemption to return the
capital of an investor's money.
MR. FINKEL: If we can please display what's in
evidence as HN208.
And your Honor, this is the document that requires the
instruction.
THE COURT: All right. So the document that you're
about to see——if you'll just enlarge it for me——is an email
from Kyle Bass to William Je. It's not being offered for the
truth of what is being stated in the email, it's being offered
merely for its effect on the recipient.
You may proceed.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, your Honor.
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, is this an email that you reviewed
before it was sent?
A. Yes.
Q. And why did you do that?
A. I think it was a team effort to review the accuracy of this
email before Kyle sent it to William.
Q. And what's the date of this email?
A. August 22nd of 2020.
Q. And prior to this email being sent by Mr. Bass to Mr. Je,
aside from that phone conversation you mentioned, had Hayman or
its attorneys received any responses to the questions that



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
Ms. Addleman had posed about the source of the funds for the
hundred-million-dollar Saraca investment?
A. No response.
Q. Can you read this document, please.
A. Me?
Q. Yes.
A. Sorry. Yes. William, given the unfortunate government
investigations that surround Saraca's investment with the
Hayman Hong Kong Fund, I am writing today to inquire about your
signature on the attached document, sent to you and the Saraca
team on July 31st. Since we first received notice of the
investigations in mid-July, our lawyers have been in frequent
contact with federal authorities regarding this investment and
have spoken repeatedly with counsel to Saraca and GTV. Based
on those discussions, through which Hayman learned information
regarding the source of funds for some of Saraca's investment
in the fund (and which had not been previously disclosed),
Hayman was compelled to act responsibly and redeem 70 million
of Saraca's initial $100 million investment. Hayman will not
be collecting any management fees from the entire $100 million
investment. As we stated in the letter, we will retain our
actual legal fees incurred in this matter. In our last phone
conversation on August 3rd, you confirmed that you would have
the attached letter signed and returned to me promptly. To
this day, I have not received your signature on the document.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
Please have it executed and send it to me as soon as possible.
Q. Pause right there.
And so in that piece of the letter to William Je, it
says that Hayman was compelled to act responsibly and redeem
70 million of Saraca's initial $100 million investment. What
does that mean, redeem?
A. So this is the mandatory withdrawal that Hayman exercised,
or the GP of the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund exercised.
And so in our——in speaking with federal authorities and counsel
for Saraca and GTV, it became evident that this $70 million was
not from in fact Saraca, as repped to us in the subscription
document, and so therefore, we were wanting to divest the
amount from the fund and put it in an escrow account, until
further instruction.
Q. And if you can keep reading.
A. The next item to be addressed relates to the remaining
30 million (part of the 100) initially invested into the Hayman
Hong Kong fund. In order to allow Saraca to remain invested in
the fund, Hayman needs to receive a representation from you and
Saraca's lawyers regarding the specific source of this money
(beyond what was initially provided stated in the subscription
documents) and that this money is not tainted in any way,
including that it does not represent assets from the GTV
offering but that it is a bona fide investment made by Saraca
and Miles.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. Pause right there.
Now where it says a bona fide investment made by
Saraca and Miles, what does Miles mean?
A. Miles Kwok.
Q. Keep going.
A. Moreover, we expect you or your lawyers to confirm that the
source of this portion of Saraca's investment has been
discussed with the federal authorities and that they have no
objection to the continuation of that portion of the investment
being managed in the fund. We have been asking for
clarification regarding this information since July 15th,
(letter from counsel also attached) and need the information
and representations from you or your lawyers by the end of next
week for us to continue managing this investment on Saraca's
behalf.
Q. Keep going.
A. Please discuss this with Miles and respond to me as soon as
possible. We need resolution on the remaining 30 million
investment by August 28th. I will be available to you at any
time you wish to speak about this and I would like to find a
resolution that everyone (including the US government
prosecutors) agrees upon.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, did the federal authorities direct
Hayman to send this email?
A. No.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. Okay. Did Hayman receive a response to this email?
A. No.
Q. Did Saraca provide a representation from itself or its
lawyers regarding the specific source of money?
A. No.
Q. Was there any representation made that the money invested
in the Hong Kong Opportunities Fund was not tainted in any way?
A. No.
Q. Was there any representation made that that money was not
from assets from a GTV offering?
A. Not to my knowledge, no.
Q. Was there any representation made by Saraca or its counsel
that the $100 million investment in the Hong Kong Opportunities
Fund Prodigious Series was a bona fide investment made by
Saraca and Miles Kwok?
A. No.
MR. FINKEL: You can zoom out of that and go to the
next page.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, do you recall what documents were
attached to this email?
A. The letter Kit Addleman sent on July 15th inquiring about
the source of funds of the Saraca Media Group investment and
also the withdrawal notice that she had sent on July 31st as
well.
Q. And what's the withdrawal notice mean?



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. That was the letter that we sent to Saraca notifying them
of the mandatory withdrawal of the $70 million.
MR. FINKEL: Okay. You can take that down,
Ms. Loftus.
Q. Now, Ms. Schottenheimer, the 30 million that was left
because it was already invested in options, what happened to
that 30 million?
A. To clarify, the 30 million——
Q. Let me ask the question this way: Saraca made a $100
million investment in the Prodigious Series. What happened to
that $100 million?
A. 70 of that was segregated and we moved it into a feeder
fund account until an agreed-upon escrow account was put in
place. The remaining 30 million, to our knowledge, was
not——was potentially a bona fide investment. We had no
evidence otherwise. And so we kept it invested in the fund
through September-October time frame of 2021.
Q. And what happened to the value of that $30 million?
A. Well, because it is a capital exhaustion fund, as marketed
in the presentation, and it is an options-based strategy, the
value of the options, as they became closer to the expiration
date, declined dramatically, so that $30 million investment,
when it was put to work back in kind of June of 2020, you know,
15 months later, when we liquidated it in the marketplace, it
was worth about $380,000.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. So how much money was lost, approximately?
A. Approximately $29.6 million.
Q. And Ms. Schottenheimer, when an investor invested in the
Prodigious Series, if they want to pull their money out six
months after investing or 12 months after investing, are they
allowed to do that?
A. No, they're not. There's no withdrawal rights for the
Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund's Share Class B.
Q. And the 70 million that was segregated, what ultimately
happened to that money?
A. It sat in our feeder account, the Onshore feeder account,
for about a year, and in July of 2021, all interested parties
did not object to it going to a escrow account in the name of
Saraca's lawyers. It was an account in Saraca's lawyers' name.
Q. When you say interested parties, who is that?
A. The government authorities involved——DOJ, SEC——and then
Saraca's lawyers didn't object to it, so Saraca.
MR. FINKEL: If we can please display what's in
evidence as Government Exhibits 222 and——sorry, excuse
me——HN222 and HN223.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, do you recognize these documents, HN222
and 223?
A. Yes.
Q. What are they?
A. These are wire confirmations.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. For what?
A. The one on the left is a wire confirmation from July 7th
from the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Onshore Fund wiring
money from its account to a JPMorgan account in the name of
Morvillo Abramowitz Grand Iason & Associates.
Q. What's the amount of that wire?
A. $69,331,019.48.
Q. And what is your understanding of what Morvillo is?
A. This is——it's my understanding that this is Saraca's
counsel at the time of the wire.
Q. And Ms. Schottenheimer, do you know what happened, if
anything, to that $69.3 million after Hayman sent it to
Morvillo's escrow account?
A. I do not.
Q. And the right, the document on the right, HN223, what is
that?
A. This is a second wire from Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities
Onshore Fund dated October 15th. The wire is coming from our
Onshore feeder——is coming from our Onshore feeder account,
being sent to a JPMorgan account in the name of Morvillo
Abramowitz Grand Iason & Associates. It's in the amount of
$382,558.58.
Q. And do you know what happened to that $382,000 after Hayman
transferred it to the Morvillo account?
A. I do not.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. And this $382,000 and change, does that represent what was
remaining of the 30 million?
A. That's, correct, the liquidation of the 30 million.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, you mentioned a moment ago that once
money is invested in the Prodigious Series, it can't be
withdrawn by an investor. Why is that?
A. Because of the——it's an industry term. It's called faded
decay of the option, meaning that this is an options-based
strategy and there is dramatic——or dramatic loss of the value
of the option immediately after investment, and so this is a
buy-and-hold strategy. You invest an amount that you are
comfortable with losing, if the Hong Kong dollar does not trade
outside of the weak side of the band within the time horizon of
these options. So for every tranche that closes, we have a
target date that all the options expire.
Q. What do you mean by "comfortable with losing"?
A. This is a very high-risk, potentially high-reward strategy,
and it is very plausible that all of the options could expire
worthless, and the Hong Kong dollar, this 40-year peg stays
within the band during the duration of your investment, and so
all investors need to be prepared to lose whatever amount they
are investing 'cause this is——this is to be used as a hedge to
their overall portfolio or a small kind of opportunistic
potentially repricing of these——this risk.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, Ms. Schottenheimer. No

further questions at this time.
THE COURT: Cross-examination.
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes. Thank you, your Honor.
CROSS EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. Good morning.
A. Good morning.
Q. So you have now been with Hayman in one form or the other
for almost 20 years, right?
A. Correct.
Q. You started as an intern in 2005, correct?
A. I started as an intern at Legg Mason but under Kyle in
2005.
Q. Got it. And then you started at Hayman the following year?
A. April of 2006, yes.
Q. Okay. And you mentioned Kyle. That's Kyle Bass, right?
A. Yes, Kyle Bass.
Q. Okay. And Mr. Bass is Hayman's chief investment officer,
right?
A. Founder and chief investment officer.
Q. All right. So fair to say he decides sort of the ultimate
investment strategies for the fund?
A. Yes.
Q. And you testified I think on direct that Hayman is
regulated by the SEC, correct?



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. At the time in question, June of 2020, Hayman was a
registered investment advisor with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Q. Okay. And that's subsequently changed, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And I believe——let's just focus on the time in question for
right now. You testified that at that time Hayman could only
take in money from certain kinds of investors, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Qualified purchasers, basically, right?
A. Yes. We only offered 3(c)(7) funds at the time.
Q. And the definition of a qualified investor that you gave on
direct, it's fair to say it's basically about income level or
assets that the investor has?
A. Specifically for qualified purchaser, it's $5 million in
marketable securities.
Q. Okay. And an accredited investor is a similar concept,
right?
A. Correct, a similar threshold but lower.
Q. Got it. You just need more——less in assets, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Now Hayman also has, for some of its funds, at least, a
minimum investment amount, right?
A. Yes, a stated minimum, yes.
Q. So for the Prodigious fund I think that was around $25,000,



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
right?
A. For the Onshore feeder fund, yes.
Q. Okay. Thank you. You're going to have to explain onshore
and offshore to me in a little bit, but for right now, Onshore
fund, right?
And so is it fair to say that there's a distinction
between the accredited investor standard and the minimum
investment, investment standard, right?
A. So we don't manage any (3)(c)(1) funds or accredited funds.
Q. Okay. Well, let's do it with the qualified purchaser, all
right?
A. Correct.
Q. There's a distinction between the qualified purchaser and
the minimum investment amount, right?
A. Correct. Those are two separate things.
Q. Right. The qualified purchaser is about the qualities of
the investor, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And the minimum investment amount is about the qualities of
the investment, right? Amount, basically.
MR. FINKEL: Object to form.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. Can you repeat the question.
Q. Sure. So the minimum——the minimum amount threshold is
about the amount of the investment, right?



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. Yes, it's set by the GP.
Q. And the minimum investment amount can be in some
circumstances waived, right?
A. Yes.
Q. But the qualified purchaser threshold, that cannot be
waived, right?
A. Unless you are a knowledgeable employee.
Q. Right.
A. That works for Hayman. So it's one of the——it's one of the
things, but yes, for external investor, there is no exceptions
for being a qualified purchaser.
Q. Got it. And I think you testified on direct that the way
Hayman learned that somebody is a qualified purchaser is
through a representation by the potential investor, right?
A. If it's someone that comes in as a reverse inquiry that we
don't know, that is the case, yes. If it's the University of
Chicago, I can look up that they manage 9 billion under assets
under their website, then no.
Q. Right. But that verification that you mentioned, that's
not required of Hayman, right?
A. Can you repeat the question.
Q. Yeah, sure. Hayman——I'll rephrase it. Maybe it will be
better.
Hayman is not required to confirm the accuracy of a
qualified purchaser representation, correct?



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. Once the representation is made, we do not look at——we're
not required to look at bank statements or any further
verification.
Q. Okay. And so that's the same with Saraca, just like any
other investor, right?
A. Pertaining to the subdocs?
Q. Yeah, at the time it was making the investment.
A. Yeah, we take the reps on the subdocs as is.
Q. So as part of your——I'm going to call it the qualification
process, is that all right, just to——
A. Okay.
Q. So as part of the qualification process for Saraca, Hayman
never had to ask for any bank account statements, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Never any sort of net worth statements, right?
A. Correct.
Q. No list of assets, right?
A. Not required.
Q. Okay. And it's not required, so you didn't ask Mr. Je for
any of that stuff, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And that was true from the time that you first got the
qualified purchaser representation from Mr. Je all the way
through when the money came in, right?
A. Can you please repeat the question.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. Sure. I'm just trying to get at that period of time
between when——
A. Did you say a number of days?
Q. Yeah, just a few days, whatever it was, right?
A. Right.
Q. But that period, whenever the qualified purchaser
representation was made and the wire came in, there was no
point in that period where you asked for the Saraca bank
statements or any confirmation, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And you're not required to, right?
A. That is correct.
Q. And now you testified earlier that you recognize Mr. Guo in
the courtroom, correct?
A. I believe I was not able to answer that question, to my
recollection.
Q. That's fine. You met him first in Texas, right?
A. I've met Mr. —— yes, I met Miles one time in Texas.
Q. All right. He was pleasant to you when you met him?
A. Very pleasant.
Q. Down to earth?
A. Very.
Q. And he was there to do an interview with Mr. Bass, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know if that interview was preplanned?



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. Yes. The Reel Vision team was there recording, and it was
planned.
Q. Okay. And it happened in an airport hangar, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Now it happened in an airport hangar because there were
security concerns, right?
A. Not to my knowledge.
Q. Do you know why it happened in the hangar?
A. Not specifically, no.
Q. And that interview happened, right? It was a Reel Vision
interview?
A. It did.
Q. And you were there for the whole interview?
A. I was.
Q. And you were asked on direct to interpret what——some things
that Mr. Bass and Mr. Guo were talking about, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Right. The prosecutor played some clips and asked you what
you thought——
A. Of the final interview, yes, that was aired.
Just for clarification, there was a full filming team
there and I was out of the frame and so I couldn't hear live
every single word that was said in the interview. I watched
the interview post facto once it was actually published.
Q. Oh, I got it. So you were able to sort of see the complete



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
interview after it was released, is that——
A. Yes, correct.
Q. Okay. Got it. And those were the clips that Mr. Finkel
was asking you to interpret, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Now it's fair to say that during that interview
Mr. Guo wasn't exactly fluent in English, right?
A. Correct. He brought an interpreter with him.
Q. Right. He even made a joke about trying to use something
he called "Chinglish," right?
MR. FINKEL: Objection.
THE COURT: You may answer if you know.
A. I don't recall that joke.
Q. You said he brought a translator. That was Mr. Je, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And Mr. Je did step in to translate from time to time,
right?
A. That is my recollection, yes.
Q. And you testified on direct that despite the language
barrier, they were discussing certain aspects of the Chinese
economy, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And there was a graph that was displayed during the
interview; do you remember that?
A. Yes.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. And you testified that Mr. Guo's team supplied that graph,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. Who was it on Mr. Guo's team that supplied that graph?
A. The graph was supplied to Kyle and so I——I don't know.
Q. Okay. So you don't have any personal knowledge that
Mr. Guo's team submitted it to Mr. Bass, right?
A. Correct.
Q. But you did testify that subsequent to that, Hayman
actually included that graph in one of its presentations,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's an investor presentation, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. So Hayman was comfortable enough with the information in
the graph to disclose it to its potential investors, right?
A. Yes, with the source of Guo Media.
Q. So you listed the source was Guo Media, right?
A. That's my recollection.
Q. Okay. But if you had thought the numbers were totally
bogus, you wouldn't have sent them out to your investors,
right?
A. Correct.
Q. Now you also testified that Hayman engages in——I think you
described it as an event-driven investment strategy, right?



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. Global event-driven investing, yes.
Q. Okay. And I think in response to the Court's question, you
gave an example of devaluing currency, right?
A. That would be a catalyst or an event, yes.
Q. So is it fair to say that it's basically making an
investment around something the fund considers to be a
significant event?
A. I don't know if the word "significant" is always
appropriate, but just an event.
Q. Okay. An event that the fund thinks is worth trading
around, right?
A. When you say fund, what fund are you speaking of?
Q. I'm talking about Hayman.
A. Hayman, yeah. So if we have a——could you please repeat the
question.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we have it read back, please, or
I'll get it wrong.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
(Record read)
A. So we would invest in securities that we tied to an
event-driven thesis, yes.
Q. Okay. So the underlying event, that could be in the US or
it could be abroad, right? Hayman does both?
A. It had a global focus. We have a global focus.
Q. But Hayman has made——has made investments based on events



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
in the United States, right?
A. Yes.
Q. So for example, in 2008, Hayman made an investment based on
the subprime mortgage market, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. And so in essence, you made an investment that the market
would go down, right?
A. Yes.
MR. FINKEL: Object to the relevance and scope.
THE COURT: Could you step up, please.
(Continued on next page)



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: Why are you asking about subprime
mortgages in 2008?
MR. KAMARAJU: Oh, I'm just trying to establish——I was
just trying to help explain what an event-driven investment
thesis is, which is they're playing against the Hong Kong
dollar. I have no more questions about this. I don't intend
to delve any further into the 2008 subprime mortgages. That
was it.
THE COURT: All right. I'll allow the question.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, if I may.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. FINKEL: I think defense counsel has gone far
enough. The 2008 investment was an investment that there would
be a housing crisis, which is to say that Hayman profited when
there was a housing crisis. 2008 is about 12 years before the
events that are relevant here, and it's already been elicited
that they made domestic investments. That's relevant, and I
didn't object to that question. To go any further into the
investment in the housing market, it appears, your Honor, it's
designed in part to portray Hayman in a negative light because
they invested in the housing crisis, which is irrelevant, so I
would ask the objection be sustained. What needs to be
elicited has already been elicited, and we shouldn't go any
further because it has no proper purpose before the jury.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
THE COURT: I don't agree. I think that it is
appropriate to give an example of a past investment. So the
objection is overruled.
(Continued on next page)



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
(In open court)
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
MR. KAMARAJU: Would you mind just reading back the
question, please.
(Record read)
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. Now on direct you spent some time talking about something
called the Prodigious Fund, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And without getting too granular at the moment, sort
of the event that was triggering for the Prodigious Fund was
some activity related to the Hong Kong dollar; fair enough?
A. Yes.
Q. And specifically, the idea is that the peg between the Hong
Kong dollar and the US dollar would break at some point, right?
A. On the weak side, yes.
Q. Right. On the weak side, because if it breaks the other
way, the fund loses money, right?
A. Correct.
Q. So you testified on direct, I believe, that there's
something called the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Sometimes called——
A. HKMA.
Q. Yes. Thank you. And it has a role to play in maintaining



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
the peg, right?
A. Yes.
Q. So it maintains US dollars reserves, right?
A. It holds US dollar——US dollars on its balance sheet, yes.
Q. Okay. And if I understood your testimony——please correct
me if I have it wrong, but——the HKMA can use those reserves to
step in to keep the peg in place, right?
A. The excess reserves, yes.
Q. Okay. And the whole concept of the peg is to keep the Hong
Kong dollar tied to a band with the US dollar, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And I think you testified that if the HKMA ran out of its
excess reserves, then that could lead the peg to break, right?
A. Likely.
Q. It likely would lead it to break, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And do you remember testifying on direct that Mr. Bass
expressed the opinion in the Reel Vision interview that the
HKMA had already spent 78 percent of its excess reserves?
A. Yes.
Q. And I think you testified further that if the peg broke,
then——and I believe this is your phrase——the market would call
out Hong Kong, right?
A. So the market could call out Hong Kong prior to the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority actually running out of reserves, in



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
anticipation that they would.
Q. Right. So basically the fear that they might could cause
the market to call out Hong Kong.
A. Could cause the Hong Kong dollar to trade outside of the
band, even prior to the HKMA running out of——officially running
out of reserves.
Q. Got it. And just to try to put it in layman's terms,
right, the phrase "call out the market," that's another way of
saying there would be a loss of confidence in the Hong Kong
economy, right?
A. In the Hong Kong dollar pegged to the US dollar is where
the loss of confidence would be.
Q. Fair enough. Fair enough. So just to be clear for the
record, the loss of confidence would be specific to the Hong
Kong dollar in this instance.
A. Hong Kong dollar's ability to maintain the peg.
Q. And I think on direct you testified that Hayman's view was
that the peg no longer made sense when they——when——I think you
were using the phrase HHKOF, right? When HHKOF was started,
Hayman's view was that the peg didn't make sense anymore,
right?
A. Correct.
Q. And that at some point in the future, it would break,
right?
A. That it would likely break, yes.



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. Okay. That's the investment thesis; fair enough?
A. Correct. Or more broadly, that the option——the optionality
is just mispriced; it's too cheap.
Q. Right. And I'm not an expert, so I'm going to try, but
basically that it makes financial or economic sense to buy the
option at that price, right?
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, I just object to the
commentary. It should just be questions to the witness.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Can you please repeat the question.
Q. Sure. That at that point in time, it made economic sense
to buy the option at that price.
A. It would depend on what your investment objectives are,
what kind of exposures you have in your portfolio, but as a
event-driven, a global event-driven investor, it made sense for
Kyle and the Hayman vehicles to invest in this strategy, in
this misprice strategy.
MR. KAMARAJU: Your Honor, I don't know if you
intended to break for lunch now or you want me to keep going.
It's up to you.
THE COURT: It's 11:29 and we will have our break.
Remember that you're not allowed to discuss the case amongst
yourself or with anyone else. Don't permit anyone to discuss
the case in your presence. Also remember that you're not
permitted to do any research about the case by any means, and



O5V1GUO2 Schottenheimer - Cross
you're not permitted to read any news coverage of the case. So
be ready to walk back into the courtroom at noon.
THE LAW CLERK: Jury exiting.
THE COURT: And you may step down. Remember not to
discuss the case.
THE WITNESS: Yes, your Honor.
(Jury not present)
THE COURT: Do the parties have anything before we
return at noon?
Oh, the witness needs to step out.
MR. FINKEL: The government does not.
MR. KAMARAJU: Nor do we, your Honor.
THE COURT: All righty.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you.
THE COURT: Yes.
(Luncheon recess)



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
A F T E R N O O N S E S S I O N
12:00 P.M.
THE COURT: Please have the witness brought back and
the jury brought in.
(Jury present)
THE COURT: Please be seated.
And please remember that you're under oath.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
THE COURT: You may continue the cross-examination.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. Now, Ms. Schottenheimer, I think when we broke off, we were
talking about the peg, right?
A. Yes.
Q. By the way, do you know why it's called a peg?
A. So technically, the Hong Kong dollar is banded to the
United States dollar. I don't know where the term --
THE COURT: One moment, please.
MR. KAMARAJU: Sorry, your Honor.
THE COURT: If you would ask the question again,
please.
MR. KAMARAJU: Absolutely.
Q. So I think the question you were responding to is do you
know why it's called a peg?
A. My response was the Hong Kong dollar is banded to the U.S.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
dollar, which means it trades within a band, not a peg. And I
don't know the origination of the term "peg."
Q. Okay. But it's commonly referred to — and you on direct
were talking about it — as a peg, right? That's the phrase
that we're using?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And before we broke, we were talking about the peg
potentially breaking, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Now, Hayman had a view that the peg would break at some
point in the future, right? Or could break at some point in
the future?
A. Break to the weak side, yes.
Q. Okay. But Hayman's view wasn't that that break would
happen immediately, right?
A. The timing of the decoupling of a 40-year peg is tough.
Q. Right. So, for example, in June 2020, the prodigious fund
closed, right?
A. It had its first closing June of 2020.
Q. Okay. So that was the first closing?
A. The first closing was June 1.
Q. Hayman wasn't anticipating that the peg was going to break
by July 4th of 2020, right?
A. It's hard for me to recall that many years ago, but I do
know that tranche one and tranche two, the initial closings of



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
June 1 and June 8th, were buying options that expired at the
end of 2021. So we were kind of giving ourselves roughly like
a year and a half runway.
Q. Okay. And do you mind just -- you used a term there,
"options" and "runway." Would you mind just explaining how
those two concepts go together?
A. Yes. In the Prodigious Series, we were purchasing options
on the Hong Kong dollar outside of the band. So basically,
it's a call option on the U.S. dollar and a put option on the
Hong Kong dollar, meaning we were long the U.S. dollar and
short the Hong Kong dollar. They were struck at seven spot --
the option price was struck at $7.85, so meaning the option
would be in the money or triggered once the Hong Kong dollar
traded outside of the band on the weak side. So seven spot 86,
seven spot 87, all of a sudden, that option is in the money.
And the term "runway" is me -- in my words is that we
were giving ourselves 18 months, roughly, or 17 -- I guess,
sorry, 19 months of time for this thesis to play out with the
options that we were buying for tranches B1 and B2.
Q. And in very, sort of, general terms, the thesis envisioned
this being sort of a gradual process, right?
How about this -- let me withdraw that question and
try a different one.
A. Okay.
Q. The thesis envisioned that this could be a process that



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
would play out over some time?
A. I recall how the trade was set up with this 19-month
duration. And I recall us wanting to get the money invested in
the options in a careful and timely manner. I can't exactly
recall the specific question that you're asking. We wanted to
be set up and positioned sooner rather than later so we could
be fully invested to capture any potential move in the Hong
Kong dollar.
Q. Got it.
All right. Let me try it a different way. Let me ask
a better question.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can we bring up what I believe is in
evidence GX HN-27, please. And can we just go to page 2.
Q. All right. So I believe you testified about it on direct,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. This is the prodigious fund deck, is that fair to say?
A. Yes.
Q. All right. So and by "deck" we just mean presentation,
right?
A. This is the initial investor presentation from May of 2020;
correct.
Q. This is what would be sent out to investors to give them
some sense of what the fund was about?
A. In May of 2020, there was iterations and updates along the



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
way.
Q. Sure. And just sticking to May of 2020, to this version
for the moment.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can we go to page 35, please.
Q. All right. Do you see the second bullet there that says
"targeting effective average duration of portfolio of roughly
12 to 14 months"?
A. Yes.
Q. What does that mean?
A. This is referencing the average option expiry of this
initial kind of portfolio or closing. So when you're buying
options at different periods of time, it wasn't that we could
just overnight put all the money to work in a single option.
So as you're buying options over the course of June,
July, and maybe August, I think that this is kind of
under-promising, in hopes that we can over deliver an effective
duration of 12 to 14 months. I'm trying to recall if we were
buying all one-year options. I think that's right.
Okay. If I could just --
Q. Take your time.
A. -- start over.
Q. Take your time. Go ahead.
A. We were focused on buying one-year options for the Share
Class B. And so when we purchased options in June, they would
expire June of the following year; and we would purchase



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
options in July, they would expire July the following year; and
August and so on.
And I think that we would hold back some of the cash
in order to purchase some options in December of 2020 for the
last expiration to be December of 2021. So the goal was to put
the exposure on with all of the options expiring by December of
2021. And the effective duration of the portfolio, meaning the
average duration of the length of the options at any given
time, would be between 12 and 14 months of coverage or exposure
to the trade.
Q. Got it.
    So is it fair to say then that Hayman wouldn't know if
it was right about this particular tranche until December 2021?
A. Correct. Because with a goal of purchasing options that
didn't expire through the end of December of 2021, we wouldn't
have been completely wrong until we knew if all of the options
expired worthless or not.
Q. So even if you lost money during that time period, the
investment thesis wouldn't have been proven wrong at that
point, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And I think you testified on direct that the strategy was a
12-to-24-month window or something in that range, right?
A. So, yeah. It depends on the timing that we have these
tranche closings; but, yes, it's between kind of --




O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
historically, it's been 12 to 24 months as the duration of
these tranches.
Q. And, in fact, the HHKOF is still in existence, right?
A. Both Share Class A and Share Class B has -- Share Class B
still has tranches.
Q. So Hayman is still using the same investment thesis or a
similar one at least today?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Let's flip back to page 2 of this, if you don't
mind, please.
All right. So who's depicted here again?
A. This is the leader of the communist party of China. His
name is Xi Jinping.
Q. Thank you. Sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off.
What is he doing?
A. He is blowing the flowers -- the pedals of the flower
that's on the Hong Kong flag.
Q. Okay. And this is in the material that's being marketed to
potential investors, right?
A. Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can we go to page 29, please.
Q. What's the title of this slide?
A. "When investors last worried about Chinese law in Hong
Kong."
Q. And what does this slide depict?



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. This slide depicts a fairly substantial devaluation in the
Hong Kong dollar primarily from 1981 to 1983.
Q. Got it.
And what is the title intended to convey?
A. I believe around 1983, Britain announced that they were
going to -- Britain had -- Hong Kong was a territory of
Britain, for lack of a better term. And Britain was announcing
that they were going to hand back Hong Kong to China, I think
it was in like 19 -- in -- Britain was no longer under UK law
effective 1997. And I think there was an announcement to that
effect sometime in the early '80s, that at some point it was
going to go back to China.
So when investors last worried about Chinese law in
Hong Kong is around the time of this announcement, and that's
around the time that the peg was put in place, to stabilize the
currency, to the best of my recollection.
Q. Fair enough.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we go to page 26, please.
Q. Can you just read the title of that slide?
A. "Beijing liaison office draws line in sand in Hong Kong on
5/2/20."
Q. And then could you read that first bullet point.
A. "Saturday, Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong warned
that the city would have no future if radical anti-government
protests return to chaos and violence at the time requiring



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
unity to fight the coronavirus crisis."
Q. And what is this bullet intended to convey to investors?
A. Given that this presentation is three years old and we no
longer have this in our deck, it's unclear to me.
Q. Okay.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can we go to page 31, please.
Q. Do you see the title "Pegs are meant to be
broken-Argentina," right?
A. Yes.
Q. So what's the purpose of including this slide in the deck?
A. I can't recall.
Q. Okay. The purpose of the deck was to give some flavor of
the investment to potential investors, right?
A. It was our body of work, our research in conveying our
thesis to investors.
Q. Right.
And you wanted to show the investors there was some
evidence for why the thesis might work, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Right.
You wanted to substantiate the idea in investors'
minds, right?
A. I would describe it as we wanted to present our
well-researched thesis.
Q. Right. You wanted to make sure they understood it wasn't



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
like a half-baked investment thesis, right?
A. That it was a thoughtful thesis.
Q. And this slide depicts a time when another country's peg
was broken, right?
A. Sitting up here today, I can't recall what Argentina is
pegged to; and so it's hard for me to discuss this slide.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. Let's go to page 34, please.
Q. So what's depicted here?
A. This is a Dragon crunching down on Hong Kong, and an
umbrella that says "democracy" across it. This is China
clamping down on Hong Kong's system of democracy.
Q. And is there any significance to the fact that the umbrella
is yellow?
A. Not to me, no.
Q. Now, in addition to this presentation, investors would also
receive something called a prospectus, right?
A. Generally, yes. We call it a confidential -- we call it a
private placement agreement.
Q. Okay. We can call it that. Like a PPM?
A. PPM.
Q. PPM? Okay. We'll use that.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we bring up Government Exhibit
29, please. Thank you.
Q. All right. So let's just start on page 1. And I think you
testified about this on direct.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. Yes.
Q. So this is the email -- you sent this email; correct?
A. I did.
Q. You were sending it to potential investors, right?
A. That it indicated interest in the Share Class B closing.
Q. And one of the documents that you sent was the PPM for the
HHKOF, right?
A. Yes, confidential offering memorandum.
Q. Got it.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can we go to page 197 of the PDF,
please.
Q. All right. So this is what we're referring to as the PPM;
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Or if the proper term is confidential offering, I'm
happy --
A. Some funds call it a PPM. This one is obviously a
confidential offering memorandum.
Q. Okay. So this memorandum is intended to convey more
detailed information about the potential investment to
investors, right?
A. Yes.
Q. So it's got a number of different sections to it, right?
A. It does.
Q. And there's a lot of work that goes into putting together



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
one of these documents, right?
A. Yes.
Q. So you get -- Mr. Bass contributes input to it, right?
A. This particular offering memorandum, I can't say that he
had input in it, no.
Q. Okay. Let's divorce it from this particular one for a
second. Just the process at Hayman.
A. Yup.
Q. Can you tell me -- you're putting together a new tranche.
What's the process for preparing a confidential memorandum
offering?
A. So it's at the fund level. So this was in existence prior
to the Prodigious Series closing for the -- initially on
June 1. So the initial Hong Kong Opportunities Onshore Fund
confidential memorandum was put in place January of 2017; it
was amended for the kind of additional Share Class B, and
that's why it's from May of 2020.
We had a previous fund called the -- we had a previous
fund that was a currency-specific fund that we kind of used the
basis of that fund for the Hong Kong strategy. And there was a
number of people that provided input and helped the lawyers
pull the draft together. I can't attest to whether Kyle was
involved in that process or not.
Q. Okay. That's fair enough.
There are a number of Hayman people involved?



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. Correct.
Q. There were lawyers involved?
A. Investment professionals.
Q. Got it. Okay.
So all of them worked together to put together a
confidential offering memorandum, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And there's a lot of different topics covered in one of
these; correct?
A. Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: So, for example, can we go to page 198.
Q. So this is titled "Partnership Directory," right.
What's the partnership directory?
A. I think it's naming all of the different kind of parties
involved and third-party representation on behalf of the
partnership.
Q. Got it.
And I think on direct you testified about having an
administrator named SEI; is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. So that's the entity that's reflected here?
A. That's our third-party administrator reflected as the
administrator.
Q. Got it.
And you see two headings down there's something called



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
auditor?
A. Yes.
Q. And there's a company listed there?
A. Deloitte & Touche.
Q. Okay. What's an auditor?
A. An auditor is a third-party service that comes in and
audits the fund on a yearly basis. They provide audited
financials on behalf of the partnership to its underlying
investors.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we go to page 224, please.
Q. All right. So this section is titled "Investment Program,"
right?
A. Yes.
Q. And then there's something entitled "Investment Objective
and Strategy"?
A. Yes.
Q. What's this section -- just generally, what's this section
intended to convey?
A. This is describing the thesis of the fund.
Q. Okay. So the investment strategy basically?
A. Yes.
Q. All right.
And the purpose here is to give a more detailed
explanation to the investors and what's happening, right?
A. As part of the offering, yes.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we go to page 235, please.
Q. And you see the title "Certain Risk Factors"?
A. Yes.
Q. What's this section intended to convey?
A. Outlining the risk factors of investing in the fund.
Q. And the first risk factor, it looks like it says market and
risk investment risks, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that a particular type of risk?
Let me withdraw and ask it this way: This is one
bucket of risk that the PPM would convey?
A. Is outlining, yes.
Q. And there are specific risks of investing in securities in
east Asian countries outlined here, right? That's the second
bolded.
A. Yes, that is in there.
Q. Okay. Don't worry, I'm not going to ask you to read
through the whole thing. But this is just, generally speaking,
targeting risks of investing in securities in east Asia?
A. This is highlighting that Asia is potentially riskier than
U.S. or other developed countries.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we show just the witness, the
parties, and the Court GX SM-08.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, do you recognize that document?
MR. KAMARAJU: Sorry. Could we go back to the first



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
page.
A. Yes.
Q. What is it?
A. This is a supplement to the confidential offering
memorandum specific to the Prodigious Series or Class B.
Q. Okay. So it's fair to say this is an addendum to sort of
the document we were looking at just before?
A. Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: Let me get it right this time. The
defense offers Government Exhibit SM-08.
MR. FINKEL: Could I ask defense counsel a question?
THE COURT: Okay.
(Counsel conferred)
MR. FINKEL: Objection.
THE COURT: If you'll step up, please.
(Continued on next page)



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
(At sidebar)
THE COURT: Does this addendum concern the defendant's
investment?
MR. KAMARAJU: It's the same fund, your Honor. It's
just a supplement covering it.
My only intention in showing it is showing that there
is a supplement and it's basically the same as the one that
came before it.
THE COURT: So what's the problem?
MR. FINKEL: The question I asked defense counsel was,
Who saw it? And his answer was, I don't know. And therefore,
I don't see its relevance. Because if the point of introducing
this document is to show the effect on Mr. Guo or Mr. Je, then
there is no effect if it wasn't seen by anybody.
He's certainly free to ask the questions they are a
supplement, that's fine. But introducing a document in
evidence that may or may not have been seen by the defendant
has no relevant purpose.
THE COURT: It was made available to them, I assume,
based upon her testimony, that she hands out these documents
before an investor invests.
MR. FINKEL: That may be. But I asked counsel whether
anyone of relevance had seen it, he said no. That was the
reason for my objection.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, I said I don't know, because I



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
haven't asked the witness the question. But it's just
simply -- it's just completing the record. It's a document
that they make available. I'm not going to make an argument
that Mr. Guo specifically saw this document. Just completing
the --
THE COURT: That's fine. The objection is overruled.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: There's not even a -- understood.
THE COURT: Are you challenging the authenticity of
it?
MR. FINKEL: I'm not challenging authenticity, your
Honor. I was going to add an additional argument my colleague
said. And as I started speaking, I heard your Honor rule, and
so I'm not saying anything further. I apologize.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Continued on next page)



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
(In open court)
THE COURT: Overruled.
(Government's Exhibit SM-08 received in evidence)
MR. KAMARAJU: So could we publish this for the jury,
please.
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. So this document -- you've testified about supplements
before, right? Sorry, let me be more specific. Supplements to
PPMs; correct?
A. I don't recall that. I mean, this document right here is a
supplement to the PPM.
Q. Okay. Fair enough.
This one is a supplement to the prodigious fund PPM?
A. The PPM that you showed me earlier was for the whole Hong
Kong fund.
Q. Okay.
A. I mean for the whole Hong Kong -- I believe what you showed
me was an onshore confidential memorandum.
Q. Okay.
A. What you're showing me right now is the supplement to the
offshore Hayman Hong Kong memorandum.
Q. Okay.
A. So this is not technically the supplement to what you --
Q. No, I got that.
A. Okay.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. I understand. Because Hayman has got two different ways in
which you can invest, right?
A. There's an onshore feeder fund and an offshore feeder fund.
Q. Got it.
And they both have -- they may have different
requirements, right?
A. Different representations. If you're a non -- if you're a
non -- if you're a tax-exempt U.S. or an offshore individual in
the offshore fund.
Q. Right. Because if you invest through the onshore, you have
to pay U.S. taxes?
A. Yeah, you receive a K-1.
Q. And that K-1 goes not just to the investor, but also to the
IRS, right?
A. I don't know.
MR. KAMARAJU: We can take that down.
Q. So you first met Mr. Je in Dallas in 2018; correct?
A. William Je?
Q. Yes.
A. I met him in Dallas in October of 2018.
Q. Okay. And you had no further communications with him until
May of 2020, right?
A. He came through the office and met with Kyle. I was not
part of the meeting, but he was reintroduced to me on his way
out.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. When was that?
A. Sometime between October 2018 and May of 2020. I can't
exactly recall.
Q. Okay. Fair enough.
Was it closer to when you initially met him or closer
to May 2020?
A. I honestly can't recall.
Q. Okay. You weren't part of the meeting though, right?
A. I wasn't part of the meeting.
Q. So you don't know what was discussed. Other than that time
that he came to the office, you didn't have any other contact
with him, right?
A. Not to my recollection.
Q. Okay. So during that period you didn't send him any
information about the Hong Kong fund, right?
A. Not to my recollection.
Q. And the first time you heard that Mr. Je had any interest
in investing was from Mr. Bass, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And that was in May 2020, right?
A. Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can we bring up what's in evidence as
Government Exhibit HN-27, please.
Q. All right. And you sent this email after Mr. Bass told you
about his conversation with Mr. Je; correct?



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. Yes.
Q. Do you see the sent time there?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. It says it was sent at almost 1 a.m. on Saturday,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you believe that's when it was actually sent?
A. It was my understanding that William was in London, so
potentially it could have been 1 a.m. London time. I don't
think I sent it U.S. time 1 a.m., but potentially I work some
strange hours sometimes, but I don't recall.
Q. Well, you did testify that there was some urgency to this
investment, right?
A. Yes, that's probably why I sent it on a Saturday.
Q. Right. And can you explain why there was urgency?
A. The genesis of Share Class B of the Hong Kong fund came
from a reverse inquiry from an existing investor, actually the
largest investor in our flagship fund. And they wanted
expedited closing of June 1.
Q. So fair to say that the window for the money coming in was
closing pretty quickly at this point, right?
A. To participate in the first closing, yes. The timing had
been previously set by a separate investor.
Q. Now, Mr. Bass was pretty eager to get this investment done
as well, right?



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. I would say that Kyle was sensitive to the timing because
the current pricing in the marketplace was -- had a good risk
return to it.
THE COURT: Could you explain what you mean by
"reverse inquiry"?
THE WITNESS: Yes. One of our current investors had
asked us if they could do a capital exhaustion vehicle. So it
was at a request by one of our investors to create a separate
share class that was capital exhaustion or put 100 percent of
the capital into the options-based strategy.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. So there was a market reason for Mr. Bass to be eager to
get this done, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And then also one of the fund's large investors
wanted to get this done quickly, right?
A. It's a separate fund, our flagship fund; but, yes, it was
at their request.
Q. Okay. And then Mr. Je comes along and says Saraca would
like to invest $100 million, right?
A. I think the initial conversation was that it wasn't
necessarily Saraca, but that Miles would have interest in this
new structure of the Hong Kong thesis.
Q. Okay. But the investment was really large, right?



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. The Saraca investment?
Q. Yeah, the proposed investment, it was big?
A. $100 million investment is a large investment.
Q. Right.
MR. KAMARAJU: Bless you.
THE COURT: Thank you.
Q. It would generate significant fees for the fund, right?
A. If the Hong Kong dollar had a substantial devaluation, it
would create substantial fees to the firm.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can we go to Government Exhibit HN-27,
which I think is this one. Can we go to page 37, please.
Q. All right. I think you walked through this on direct a
little bit. But you see the place where it says "management
fee"?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So the management fee gets paid to Hayman regardless
of whether the investment thesis works out or not, right?
A. That is correct.
Q. It's basically once the investment comes in, the management
fee is owed, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And it's not -- it's the investor paying Hayman, right?
A. To manage the capital.
Q. Right. And that's standard practice in the hedge fund
industry, right?



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. Yes.
Q. That's not unusual for Hayman or anyone else; a management
fee is standard, right?
A. Standard hedge fund fees, yes.
Q. And so $100 million investment at two percent would have
been $2 million right up front, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And then I think what you're referring to is if the bet
paid off, the fund might stand to make substantially more than
that, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And that's the performance allocation that's referred to
here, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Now, at that time in 2020, I believe you testified on
direct that Hayman had approximately $400 million under
management, right?
A. Yes.
Q. That's its AUM, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And, in fact, specifically going into the closing of the
prodigious fund, that April/May period, it was approximately
$400 million, right?
A. It might have been a little less, like 300 and some.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we go to Government Exhibit



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
HN-29, please.
THE COURT: Are you speaking of total assets under
management?
THE WITNESS: Across the entire firm, going into 2020,
it was 400; midway through the year, like May time frame, I
believe it was 300 and change.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we go to Government Exhibit 29,
please. Can we just go to -- first, let's just stay here for a
second.
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. All right. Do you see the attachments there,
Ms. Schottenheimer? And I'm specifically looking at the one
that's the second from the last.
A. Form ADV?
Q. Yeah. Do you see that one?
A. Yup.
Q. Do you know what a form ADV is?
A. Yes. It's a filing required by firms that are registered
with the SEC as a registered investment adviser.
MR. KAMARAJU: And could we go to page 315 of this
document.
Q. All right. Is this the form ADV brochure?
A. Yes, as of March 30.
Q. So this is the last one filed before the prodigious fund --
before that June 1 prodigious fund closing, right?



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. I understand this to be an annual filing.
Q. Okay.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can we go to page 318, please.
Q. All right. And so at the top there you see it says item 4,
advisory business? Can you just read the last sentence of that
paragraph, please.
A. "As of December 31, 2019, Hayman managed approximately 432
million in assets under management on a discretionary basis on
behalf of its clients."
Q. Okay. So by the time we get to like spring of 2020, that
number has gone down a little bit, right?
A. To the best of my recollection, yes.
Q. Okay. So $100 million could be anywhere -- could be north
of 25 percent of the assets that the fund had under management
at that time, right?
A. We had had a closing on June 1 of close to $40 million.
But, yes, somewhere around 20 percent of assets under
management.
Q. A big chunk.
A. A minority.
Q. Sure. Sure. But the next biggest investor had put in, I
think, 30 or $40 million, right?
A. Specifically to the Hong Kong fund?
Q. Yeah.
A. I think it was around 50 at the time.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. Okay. So this would be almost twice that investment,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. And it's fair to say that when the checks got larger,
Mr. Bass's involvement got more significant?
A. In what regard?
Q. Well, for example, if there were particularly
high-net-worth individuals who were planning to invest,
Mr. Bass might have more face-to-face -- withdrawn. Mr. Bass
might have more contact with them, right?
A. Not necessarily.
Q. But it happened from time to time, right?
MR. FINKEL: Objection. Asked and answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. So in this case, Mr. Bass is the one who told you about
Mr. Je; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And Mr. Bass had direct communications with Mr. Je, to your
knowledge, right?
A. That is my understanding.
Q. And he spoke to him on the phone, right?
A. That was my understanding.
Q. You didn't speak to Mr. Je on the phone, right?
A. I did not.
Q. And there were times when Mr. Je may be slow to respond to



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
some of your inquiries, right?
A. My specific inquiries?
Q. Or the fund's inquiries.
Well, let's say your inquiries. Let's stick to yours,
your inquiries.
A. I specifically remember after Mr. Je had requested the side
letter, I had reached out to him a couple of times asking for
the names of the entities that were investing so I could clear
it for conflict with my third-party counsel. That is the only
time that I recall Mr. Je -- me having to follow up multiple
times to get a response.
Q. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
A. But it was within a matter of days.
Q. Okay. Did Mr. Bass also try to follow up with Mr. Je then?
A. Yes. I had enlisted Kyle, The next time you talk to
William, we need these names to clear them for conflict.
Q. Because Mr. Bass had a clearer pipeline to Mr. Je, right?
A. It was just whoever talked to him first was hopefully going
to collect the names so we could clear them for conflict.
Q. Now, it was Mr. Bass who originally gave you the names of
the companies that were going to invest, right?
A. Via text.
Q. Right. And we looked at that text on direct, right?
A. Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can we pull up Government Exhibit



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
HN-33.
Q. This is that text message, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you see at the top it says "because of the tight
timing"?
A. Yes.
Q. What do you understand that to be a reference to?
A. At one point they were trying to invest as of June 1, along
with the other reverse inquiry investor from our flagship fund.
Q. And this text was sent on May 26th, right?
A. Ahead of the June 1 closing. At some point it became
evident that they weren't going to make that cutoff, and so we
set a date around their preferred timing.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. And can we scroll down a little
bit.
Q. So then you tell Mr. Bass that you're going to send William
the AML requirements, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And how does he respond?
A. "Okay. Let's fast-track everything. Thank you. Remember,
he's asleep now. He won't get back -- so you won't get it back
until tomorrow."
Q. What did you understand Mr. Bass to mean when he said
"let's fast-track everything"?
A. In response to me requesting the AML requirements, that we



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
wanted to get the AML in to have that approved ahead of time so
that wouldn't slow down their ability to invest.
Q. It's true, right, that sometimes the AML process can take
some time, right?
A. Depending the complexity of the entity investing, yes.
Q. Right. I think on direct you described a process of
drilling down, right?
A. Yes.
Q. So drilling down can be simple sometimes, right?
A. Can be very simple.
Q. And sometimes can be very complicated, right?
A. Can be very complicated.
Q. So what makes drilling down particularly complicated?
A. When an entity is owned by entities.
Q. I'm sorry, could you explain what you mean by that?
A. When an entity is not owned by a person, it's owned by
additional entities, separate entities. So you could have
entity A that's owned by entity B, C, D, and you have to keep
drilling into the different entities until you find an actual
person to do AML on.
Q. Got it.
Because you need the specific person in order to run
them through AML, right?
A. Correct. Anyone who owns more than 20 percent of an entity
is considered a beneficial owner and needs to have an AML



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
check.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we go back to Government Exhibit
HN-37 for a second.
All right. It's not in? Take it down for the jury.
I'm sorry, I thought you put it in. Can I just show it to the
witness, the Court, and the parties.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, do you recognize this document?
A. One second.
Q. Oh, yeah, please. Take your time.
A. Yes. I'm familiar with this email.
Q. Okay. So it's an email chain, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And it starts with emails between you and Mr. Je, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And Mr. Bass is copied on those underlying emails, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And the time period of these emails is around May 29, 2020,
right?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And it concerns a side letter that Mr. Je was seeking;
correct?
A. Correct.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. The defense would offer
Government Exhibit HN-37.
MR. FINKEL: Objection. Hearsay.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
THE COURT: Step up please.
(At sidebar)
THE COURT: So the first email from Mr. Je to
Ms. Schottenheimer concerns the terms they were negotiating;
correct?
MR. KAMARAJU: Yeah. My only purpose in introducing
the email is to show that Mr. Bass asked Ms. Schottenheimer to
call him about the side letter. I'm not introducing it for the
truth of any of the underlying materials, just to say that
Mr. Bass asked Ms. Schottenheimer to call, which is basically
one of the exceptions that we had talked about yesterday, I
believe, an instruction or a direction.
MR. FINKEL: He's certainly free to ask the question,
Did Mr. Bass contact you via phone to discuss whatever, or in
response to an inquiry from Mr. Je. But defense can't put in
documents for declarants for Mr. Bass and Ms. Schottenheimer
and Mr. Je. We object on that basis.
It's not being offered -- every time there's a hearsay
objection, I understand. Obviously, as Mr. Fergenson mentioned
yesterday, the devil is in the details on all these things.
There's an explanation that it's for the state of mind or to
show, in fact, that all these things.
We disagree with that in this particular case. I
don't object to the question, Did you speak with Mr. Bass on
the phone in response to an inquiry from Mr. Je? That's fine.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
But the document is hearsay and the government objects.
MR. KAMARAJU: On what basis is the document hearsay?
MR. FINKEL: It's a third-party declarant who's not
testifying. And it's also a statement by a co-conspirator
which they can't offer under the rules. That's the basis.
THE COURT: So you have William Je to
Ms. Schottenheimer, then Ms. Schottenheimer to Kyle Bass.
Certainly she can authenticate her email.
MR. KAMARAJU: And I'm only intending to ask her about
the top email. And I think they've already introduced emails
about this very topic between Ms. Schottenheimer and Mr. Je.
So we're not --
THE COURT: You're not seeking to introduce the first
email from Mr. Je?
MR. KAMARAJU: I think you need that just to explain
what the phone call was about. You know, I mean, I can
certainly confuse the witness, offer an active version of it,
and just have her not know what the substance of the phone call
is. But we're not offering it for the terms that are being
negotiated. I'm going to ask her that question.
But all I'm really asking for is that setting up that
Mr. Bass asked Ms. Schottenheimer to call him about the subject
of the terms that Mr. Je wanted to negotiate. That's not
offered for the truth, your Honor. And until the government
can articulate an actual basis -- hearsay basis for it, there's



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
no hearsay objection.
MR. FINKEL: So there is a hearsay objection.
THE COURT: Wait a minute. I thought it went from Je
to Schottenheimer, Schottenheimer to Bass.
MR. KAMARAJU: So it goes Je to Schottenheimer, then
Schottenheimer forwards the email to Bass and says Je wants
this. And Kyle Bass responds, Call me.
So I'm not introducing it for the truth of what Je
wants. I'll ask her that question, right. All I'm introducing
it for is the idea that Kyle Bass says to her -- she goes to
Kyle Bass and says, you know, This is what he wants. And Kyle
Bass says, Call me and I'll explain it, which is a nonhearsay
use.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, if I may, what they want this
in for clearly is for what Je is saying. Because otherwise the
question would be very appropriately put: Did you speak with
Mr. Bass about what Je wanted? That's a -- if I can please
finish.
MR. KAMARAJU: I haven't said anything.
MR. FINKEL: That's an appropriate question.
They are trying to introduce a document to get into
the record Je's statements which the defense can't do. That is
hearsay. I understand they have a view that it's not being
offered for the truth; but merely saying so does not make it
so.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
The government believes -- it's an authentic document.
There's no dispute of authenticity. I'm not disputing
authenticity. I'm disputing hearsay. On that basis, the
objection, respectfully, should be sustained and we should move
on and pose the question.
THE COURT: You're saying that it comes in as a
command from Mr. Bass?
MR. KAMARAJU: I'm saying it comes in as a request
from Mr. Bass to call me. It's just that simple.
If your Honor wants to put a limiting instruction with
it to say they can't consider the underlying things, whatever
motivation Mr. Finkel is ascribing to, I am telling you that my
only purpose, my only set of questions is to say: Mr. Bass
asked you to call him when you contacted him about this, right?
MR. FINKEL: So why not just ask that question?
MR. KAMARAJU: Because I'm allowed to set it up, Ryan.
I'm not limited to asking questions.
THE COURT: So the elimination of the Je to
Schottenheimer email is acceptable to you?
MR. KAMARAJU: If you want. I mean, I think she
needs -- I think she needs the subject line because otherwise
she's not going to know what the email is about; she's not
going to know what the subject is.
But if you want to redact -- first of all, this is a
government exhibit that was produced to us in this way. So we



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
didn't -- this is not a defense exhibit.
But second, if that is the concern, I just want to
make sure that it is recognizable for the witness so that she
understands what it is. But I don't -- the fact that the
government is unable to articulate a reason why our hearsay
objection -- our hearsay argument isn't valid other than saying
that's not really what they want to do, your Honor, it's not
enough that you should reject the objection.
THE COURT: I think we established yesterday that
commands don't constitute hearsay.
MS. SHROFF: Exactly.
THE COURT: But the Je portion of it is hearsay.
MR. KAMARAJU: Sure. Which your Honor can easily
solve by just saying don't consider the bottom part of the
email for the truth.
MR. FINKEL: I think it should be redacted. They can
zoom in on the portion of the email that your Honor is going to
admit. They can prepare a redacted version of the document.
MR. KAMARAJU: But why do we need to redact it?
MR. FINKEL: Because it's hearsay.
THE COURT: What does the subject matter say?
MR. KAMARAJU: It just says -- it says side letter is
the subject line. And then he's talking about the terms of the
side letter.
THE COURT: Okay. So if she can testify that Mr. Bass



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
wanted her to call, I have no problem with admitting that
portion of the email without the William Je portion.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. So how would your Honor like me
to handle it right now? Should I just focus on the top
portion?
MR. FINKEL: If I may.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. FINKEL: Part of the reason the defense has said
that they need the letter is because she doesn't know the
subject matter and she doesn't know this. Let's see what she
knows; maybe she remembers. That's number one.
So if there's a failure of recollection, this can be
used to refresh. That's number two.
The third is based on your Honor's ruling, they should
just blow up — they certainly have the technology; if not, we
can do it — the top portion of the email and introduce that
piece of the exhibit and then they'll redact the rest.
MR. KAMARAJU: I should get both pieces. I should get
Ms. Schottenheimer's email to Mr. Bass --
THE COURT: Yes, I agree.
MR. KAMARAJU: -- and I should get Mr. Bass's
response.
THE COURT: That's fine.
Okay. That's how we'll go forward.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
(In open court)
(Government's Exhibit HN-37 received in evidence)
MR. KAMARAJU: Your Honor, may I publish this portion
that's on the screen?
THE COURT: Yes, you may.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. Thank you.
Could we publish it for the jury, please.
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. Okay. Ms. Schottenheimer, do you see your email to
Mr. Bass there at the bottom?
A. Yes.
Q. And do you see the subject is "Side Letter," right?
A. Correct.
Q. What is that a reference to?
A. That's in reference to the side letter that William Je had
requested on behalf of the entities he was directing to invest
in the Hong Kong fund.
Q. And where you refer to terms with a minimum of a one
million investment, what does that mean?
A. To my recollection, there was a version of the side letter
that they were requesting the terms subject to a million
dollars minimum investment.
Q. So they were asking for favorable terms on the $1 million
portion of the investment?
A. It's hard for me to perfectly recall without the draft of



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
the side letter, but it was my understanding that they were
asking for these terms in connection with a million-dollar
investment.
Q. Okay. And it would be unusual normally for a
million-dollar investment to be able to get any kind of side
letter, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Why did you reach out to Mr. Bass about this?
A. He was negotiating the side letter directly with William.
Q. And was it your view that it was pretty aggressive to ask
for a side letter in connection with a million-dollar
investment?
A. I think I understood that there was some sort of
miscommunication. At this point, I don't know, May 29th, if it
had been represented to me that there was also a $50 million
investment in the mix as well; and that the wording, I think,
was just improperly outlined on the initial draft of the side
letter.
Q. Okay. And then how does Mr. Bass respond?
A. "Call me on this. I will explain."
Q. Did you speak with Mr. Bass about it?
A. Yes.
Q. And what was the outcome of that conversation?
A. He explained that William Je wanted to invest a million
dollars personally in addition to the capital that was coming



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
from Miles Kwok's family office, but it would be a separate
entity.
Q. And so --
A. The resolution --
Q. Yeah, sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
A. The resolution was because they were affiliated entities,
our external counsel was comfortable drafting the side letter
with a $51 million minimum. And I think, to the best of my
recollection, that is what went into the final version of the
side letter.
Q. Was it 51 million or was it a 101 million that went into
the side letter?
A. At one point I thought it was $51 million -- at some point
it went from 50 million from Saraca to 100. But I believe in
the final side letter I thought it was 51.
Q. Okay. Now, when we looked at the text message you
mentioned starting -- sorry. You mentioned starting anti-money
laundering checks with Mr. Je, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And you testified on direct about what anti-money
laundering checks are. They are part of the KYC process,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. And "KYC" stands for know your customer, right?
A. Yes.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. And you testified on direct that the SEC requires you to do
those kinds of checks, right?
A. Yes, it's all -- yeah, yes.
Q. And there are other government agencies that also have
checks that are part of the KYC process, right?
A. It's, yeah, broadly, I think, financial institutions have
to engage in KYC with any of their customers.
Q. And they have to check the entities against various U.S.
government lists, for example, right?
A. Yes. I'm really only familiar with our process.
Q. Okay. Well, tell me your process.
A. We collect the required documentation outlined on the AML
grid. We use SCI as our third-party administrator. And we
have outsourced the AML function to our third-party
administrator. They have a team that runs AML for our funds.
Q. Got it.
And are you aware what checks they run?
A. Generally, they check the names and details of all of the
required persons to have AML, beneficial owners, authorized
signatories, and controlling persons against a world check
database that checks against OFAC and a number of other broadly
kind of terrorist list or kind of persona non grata list. And
they do this at the time of investment and on a monthly basis.
And they provide a report to us saying that there's no hit.
We've never had a hit, so no hits on a monthly basis for each



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
of our funds.
Q. And, sorry, you mentioned OFAC. What is that?
A. I can't -- I don't know the acronym.
Q. That's okay. Just generally --
A. It's a list of terrorists. Not just terrorists, but people
that you cannot do business with.
Q. And so that's -- checking against the OFAC list is one of
the parts of the AML, right?
A. That is outsourced, yes, yeah.
Q. Thank you.
Now, you testified on direct about something you
called an AML grid, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And part of the AML grid is a list of questions for the
investor to answer, right?
A. It depends on -- a lot of the AML is baked into the
questionnaire within the sub doc. The AML grid shows a list of
the documents that you need to provide and the information that
you need to provide on the ultimate beneficial owner,
controlling persons, and I think that's it.
MR. KAMARAJU: Just one second.
Q. Now, you testified on direct that there was a time when
Mr. Je told you that money would need to come from a different
entity, right?
A. Yes.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. And that was -- from your perspective, that might have been
an AML problem, right?
A. It was.
Q. And Mr. Je ultimately resolved that problem, right?
A. The money came in from an account from Saraca.
Q. Right. And so that fixed the AML concern that you had,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. And, sorry, I forgot to ask the question before, but just
going back to the side letter quickly, it's not unusual for
larger investors to get side letters, right?
A. Not unusual.
Q. And the terms of those side letters and what -- withdrawn.
What Hayman is willing to agree to in a side letter is
based in part on the economics of the investment, right?
A. I don't understand the question. Can you please repeat it?
Q. Sure.
If an investor is asking for particular terms, right?
A. Mm-hmm.
Q. One of the factors that would go into Hayman's decision as
to whether to accept those terms is the size of the investment,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. Now, in the subscription packet, right, one of the
questions is source of wealth, right?



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. Yes.
Q. Now, the subscription packet did not always have a source
of wealth question in it, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. That was added over the last few years, right?
A. Few years from 2020, yes.
Q. I'm sorry, you said yes?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And you testified that at first, the Saraca form was
missing the source of wealth information, right?
A. Yes.
Q. That's also not unusual, right?
A. It is typical for there to be corrections in a sub doc.
For that question to be skipped, it's been skipped before, but
I don't think it's a regular occurrence.
Q. Right. You had other investors who have been -- who have
failed to fill that in, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you've had investors who were confused about what that
question was seeking, right?
MR. FINKEL: Objection. Calls for speculation.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Well, you personally have dealt with investors who have
been confused about that, right?
MR. FINKEL: Same objection.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
THE COURT: Sustained.
Can't speak to what other people are thinking.
Q. You personally have had other investors express confusion
to you about that question?
MR. FINKEL: Same objection.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. Can we go to Government Exhibit
HN-51.
(Counsel conferred)
Q. Do you recognize this?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. The defense offers Government Exhibit HN-51.
MR. FINKEL: No objection.
THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Government's Exhibit HN-51 received in evidence)
MR. KAMARAJU: Can we publish that, please.
Q. All right. So this is the -- you see where it says
"briefly identify subscribers," right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So this is the specific source of wealth question
for the Saraca subscription package; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And what's listed there is selling shares of subsidiary,
right?
A. Yes.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. Now, nothing in that description raised a red flag for you,
right?
A. Correct. It looks like a liquidation event to me.
Q. And you didn't ask for any additional information about it
at the time, right?
A. Nor did SCI.
Q. Well, that was going to be my next question. You passed it
along to SCI for them to review it, right?
A. I did.
Q. They didn't come back with any follow-up questions about
it, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And they are the AML experts, right?
A. We rely on their expertise.
Q. That's what you pay them for, right?
A. Correct.
MR. KAMARAJU: Now, can we pull up Government Exhibit
HN-57, please. And we can publish this to jury.
Q. All right. Now, this is an email from Mr. Je to you,
right?
A. At the top?
Q. Yeah, at the top.
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And it's cc'ing Mr. Bass, right?
A. Yes.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. And there are a number of attachments to it, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And these are documents that you required or Hayman
required for the Saraca investment to go through, right?
A. Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: So can we go to page 7. Maybe let's go
to the page before that. Thank you.
Q. So you testified on direct about this, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you see the primary contact there?
A. Yes.
Q. What's the email address listed for the primary contact?
A. Yvettew@gtv.org.
Q. Now, while this subscription agreement documentation was
being collected, Kyle Bass was discussing being a director of
GTV; correct?
MR. FINKEL: Objection.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Were you aware that during this period when the
subscription documentation was being collected, Kyle Bass was
having discussions about being a director at GTV?
A. No.
Q. GTV is a subsidiary of Saraca, right?
A. I don't know.
MR. KAMARAJU: Pull that down for a second.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
And can we go to page 39.
Q. Do you see an email address listed there, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Same email address, right?
A. Yes.
MR. KAMARAJU: May I just have one moment, your Honor.
(Counsel conferred)
Q. Did you ever become aware that Mr. Bass was trying to
become a GTV director?
MR. FINKEL: Objection. Asked and answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we pull up Government Exhibit
HN-168. 168. Not in? Okay. Can we go to the attachment,
please.
Q. Now, you remember you testified about this on direct,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And there's a list of questions that you testified
to, right, in this letter?
A. The bullets, yes.
Q. Now, Hayman never asked any of these questions prior to
accepting the Saraca investment; correct?
A. Correct.
Q. This only was prompted by the SEC's inquiry, right?
A. Yes.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. And Hayman at the time relied on the SEC's approval to do
business, right?
A. In what context?
Q. Well, you testified that they are a registered investment
adviser, right?
A. Hayman at the time was a registered investment adviser with
the SEC, so they are our governing body.
Q. Right. So they could -- I don't know if it's the right
term, but they could deregister you, right?
A. Yes, potentially. I'm not really clear on that, but yeah.
Q. But you didn't think there was anything wrong with Saraca's
original response; correct?
MR. FINKEL: Objection to the form. Vague.
THE COURT: Overruled.
A. Can you please repeat the question.
Q. Sure.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can we read it back, please.
(Record read)
A. Saraca's initial -- Saraca's response in the subscription
document regarding the source of wealth was sufficient to --
for the AML requirement to subscribe to the Hayman Hong Kong
Opportunities Fund.
Q. Okay. And you testified on direct that you had discussions
with Mr. Bass about the SEC's inquiry, right?
A. Yes.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. Do you recall Mr. Bass ever criticizing the SEC's inquiry?
A. I can't recall any comments at this time.
Q. Was he happy about the SEC's inquiry?
MR. FINKEL: Objection. Asked and answered.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. He was not happy.
Q. He was upset about it, right?
A. About the inquiry?
Q. Yeah.
A. I think he was upset about being lied to by where the funds
were coming from.
Q. Sure. And he wouldn't be happy about the SEC investigating
either, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And did you hear him express his unhappiness about it?
A. I just can't recall a specific conversation about it.
Q. Now, on direct, Mr. Finkel asked you whether HHKOF
involved, his phrase was a bet against the Hong Kong dollar,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. Hayman isn't a casino, right?
A. No.
Q. Not a sports book, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Hayman doesn't make bets; it makes investments, right?



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. Correct.
Q. And he asked you about Mr. Kwok making an investment in
Hayman, right?
A. Yes.
Q. He asked you about Mr. Kwok sending $100 million to Hayman,
right?
A. I can't recall if it was Mr. Kwok specifically or
Mr. Kwok's family office or -- but, yes, generally, Mr. Kwok.
Q. Okay. And today he asked you questions about the
Saraca/Kwok investment, right?
A. I believe so.
Q. Okay. Mr. Kwok never made an investment in Hayman, right?
A. Personally, no.
Q. His name doesn't show up in a single investment at Hayman,
right?
A. Correct.
Q. Not as Ho Wan Kwok, right?
A. What are you asking? I apologize.
Q. I'm saying there's no Hayman investment in the name of Ho
Wan Kwok, right?
A. Sorry. Can you spell it?
Q. Sure. H-O, space, W-A-N, space K-W-O-K.
A. Correct.
Q. There's no investment in the names of Miles Kwok, right?
A. Correct.



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. There's no investment in the name of Miles Guo, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you know that because if there was an investment in
Mr. Guo's name, you'd have done an AML on him, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's true if the investment was in his own name,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's true if he even owned just 20 percent of the
company that made the investment, right?
A. Yes.
Q. But based on the documentation, you did not think it was
necessary to do any AML on Mr. Guo, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And in either circumstance, you would have to do the
drill-down process that you were talking about, right?
A. If he'd invested in an entity that he owned or invested in
his name?
Q. Yes.
A. Would there have been AML checks either way.
Q. Now, the investment was in the name of a company owned by
Mr. Guo's son, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you did a -- I think you testified on direct you did a
thorough review of that file, right?



O5VVGUO3 Schottenheimer - Cross
A. Of the subscription agreement?
Q. Yeah.
A. Yes.
Q. And you thought that this investment was coming in through
Mr. Kwok's family office, right?
A. Yes.
Q. It's not unusual for a family office to involve multiple
members of the family, right?
A. Not unusual.
Q. Right? The investments can be on behalf of different
family members, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Doesn't always have to be the father, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And it's not unusual for people to involve their children
in their family office, right?
A. Very common.
Q. But the fact that an investment is made by one of Mr. Guo's
relatives does not make it Mr. Guo's investment, right?
A. It was my understanding that the wealth amassed was, in
fact, Mr. Miles Kwok's.
(Continued on next page)



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Cross
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. But you didn't do any AML check on him, right?
A. We weren't required to.
Q. You didn't do any due diligence on him, right?
A. Meaning?
Q. Well, you testified on direct about the phrase "due
diligence," so whatever meaning you gave it, same one.
A. There was no formal AML done on Mr. Kwok, Mr. Miles Kwok.
Q. Which you would have had to do if you thought that this
investment was his, right?
A. If he was listed as a beneficial owner and authorized
signatory or controlling persons, but given the reps provided
by Saraca Media, that was not the case.
Q. I'm sorry. Your testimony is that you thought that the
money was his but you didn't need to figure out whether the
entities were; is that right?
MR. FINKEL: Asked and answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Now Saraca came through the Onshore fund, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Which means that they would get a K1, right?
A. They had a tax ID with the United States and they would get
a K1.
Q. Now you testified that you only met Mr. Guo once, right?
A. Correct.



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Cross
Q. And in this courtroom is the first time you've seen him
since 2018, right?
A. Yes.
Q. But you met with the prosecutors several times, right?
A. Yes.
Q. More than five times?
A. Yes.
Q. In fact, you met with them just a couple hours before your
testimony started yesterday, right?
A. Briefly.
Q. Over the lunch break?
A. Yes.
Q. Just downstairs in this building, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And at all of those meetings, you discussed your testimony
with them, right?
A. In meetings, I answered questions truthfully.
Q. Right. They asked you questions, you gave them answers,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. And in anticipation of your testimony, they told you what
questions they anticipated asking you here today, right?
A. Not necessarily.
Q. They showed you the documents that they were going to show
you, right?



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Redirect
A. They showed me documents, yes.
Q. They asked you questions about those documents, right?
A. They asked questions.
Q. They showed you those emails that we looked at, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Now in none of those emails do you refer to it as the Kwok
investment, right?
A. I don't believe so.
Q. Right. That was Mr. Finkel's choice of words, right?
A. Yes.
Q. That's his description, not yours, right?
A. I've described the investment and spoke to the investment
however——whatever word choice I've——I've used. Miles family
office, primarily called it Saraca, by the actual name of the
entity that invested.
Q. So you don't recall him asking you questions about the Kwok
investment and you describing it that way?
MR. FINKEL: Asked and answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, you would agree with me, right, it's
not accurate to call it the Kwok investment, right?
A. At the time of May of 2020 and June of 2020, I thought of
it as Miles Kwok's investment from his family office.
Q. So you just didn't follow the procedures that you would
need to if you did that, right?



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Redirect
A. Not correct.
MR. KAMARAJU: No further questions, your Honor.
THE COURT: Redirect?
REDIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, did you follow the procedures that
you're required to follow when conducting the facilitation of
the Saraca $100 million investment?
A. Yes.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, during the meetings you had with the
government, what did the government tell you to do when you
testified?
A. Tell the truth.
Q. Is the Prodigious Series offered to the general public?
A. No.
Q. Is it offered to qualified purchasers?
A. Select qualified purchasers.
Q. And why is the Prodigious Series only offered to qualified
purchasers, select qualified purchasers?
A. Because we rely on a 3(c)(7) exemption, and in order to
maintain that exemption, we have to make sure that we are only
marketing to sophisticated investors with a net worth of——or
investable assets of $5 million or more.
Q. And why is the Prodigious Series only marketed to
sophisticated investors?



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Redirect
A. Because of how we have the fund structured; it's a 3(c)(7)
fund.
Q. You mentioned something on cross-examination about multiple
closing dates. Can you explain to the jury what that means.
A. So for the share Class B or Prodigious Series, that the
Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund, because it is 100 percent
options based and a capital exhaustion strategy, there's no
money in or no money out, once we have a closing, we have to
have a series of closings in order to take in new capital, so
to date we've closed B1 through B12.
Q. So the Saraca investment, the 100 million investment, what
was the closing date of that?
A. June 8th.
Q. And was there a June 1 closing?
A. There was.
Q. And so why was there a second closing on June 8?
A. It's my understanding that that timing was too tight for
them.
Q. Too tight for whom?
A. Too tight for Saraca to participate.
MR. FINKEL: Would you bring up what's in evidence as
HN57 at page 7, I believe.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, do you recall this document?
A. Yes.
Q. It says, "Total number of equity/capital/or beneficial



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Redirect
owners of the Investor"?
A. Yes.
Q. Why does Hayman request that information?
A. So we can understand how many beneficial owners are and who
we need to collect AML on.
Q. And so if this number was two, how would that impact, if at
all, the way you performed diligence on this particular
investment?
A. Well, it would be dependent on what was provided to us. If
each beneficial owner owned 50 percent, then we would do AML
checks on both, but if one owned 90 percent and the other owned
10 percent, we'd only be required to do AML checks on the
individual that owned the 90 percent, or more than 20 percent.
Q. But this question isn't a question about who owns
20 percent or more, or is it a question about total number of
beneficial owners?
A. This is about total number.
MR. KAMARAJU: I object to the form.
THE COURT: Overruled.
Q. So this representation is that there's just one investor
for the Saraca investment, correct?
A. Who owns a hundred percent of Saraca, correct.
Q. And that's who, based on the documents?
A. Miles Kwok's son.
MR. FINKEL: If we can bring up, please, HN51.



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Redirect
And if we can zoom in at the top.
Q. You were asked some questions about this document on cross;
is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And so it says on there, "Briefly identify the subscriber's
primary source of wealth." It says, "Selling shares of
subsidiary," correct?
A. Yes.
Q. If Hayman had known that Saraca's source of wealth were GTV
investors who were not told that they were investing in the
HHKOF, would you have accepted Saraca's investment?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection to form, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, if you had known in early June of 2020
that this statement "Selling shares of subsidiary" was a lie,
would you have accepted Saraca's investment?
MR. KAMARAJU: Same objection.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. If you had known that this statement "Selling shares of
subsidiary" was untrue, would you have accepted Saraca's
investment?
MR. KAMARAJU: Same objection.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, I thought this was consistent
with——could we approach.



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Redirect
THE COURT: Yes.
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: So my recollection is that I permitted
hypotheticals to the victim, not to a company like this.
MR. KAMARAJU: That's right, your Honor, because it
goes to materiality.
MR. FINKEL: So, your Honor, the Second Circuit has
now adopted what I think is commonly referred to as the
conversions theory. What that means is that, in a wire fraud
context, the crime can be completed based on any action in
furtherance of the scheme that is a misrepresentation.
Therefore, the government would argue, in part, that part of
the scheme was maintained by this lie. In addition, your
Honor, government also charged the——the last count of the
indictment, which statute is escaping me right now——yeah, the
1957 charge, which is the illegal use of funds, which is use of
funds derived from a crime, the fact that they're lying to
Hayman about where the funds came from is evidence of relevance
to that particular charge in and of itself. So my
understanding, your Honor——forgive me if I misinterpreted the
Court's prior ruling; that's why I asked the question because I
thought it was consistent——I think it is relevant because it
shows that had they told the truth, the entire way the scheme
would have unfolded would have unfolded differently; it would
have failed.



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Redirect
THE COURT: So my recollection is that you were
speaking about the individual victim investors in your motion.
That's my recollection. Am I wrong about that?
MR. FINKEL: I think you're right. But separate and
apart from that, I still think this is a permissible
hypothetical question for the reasons I just identified.
MR. KAMARAJU: There is no authority to asking a
hypothetical question to a nonvictim.
THE COURT: I'm sustaining the objection.
MR. FERGENSON: Just a final point on the conversion
theory point, your Honor? Materiality is an element if that
material misrep was made to a victim or to someone else, and
that's Second Circuit law. You don't have to make the material
misrep to a victim.
THE COURT: Why didn't you bring it up in your papers
then?
MS. SHROFF: Exactly.
MR. FERGENSON: We thought——
MR. KAMARAJU: Seems like that's the answer to me.
MS. SHROFF: That answers the question right there.
THE COURT: I'm going to sustain the objection.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
(Continued on next page)



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Redirect
(In open court)
THE COURT: Sustained.
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, you were asked some questions on
cross-examination——
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, I'm sorry.
MR. KAMARAJU: My apologies, your Honor.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, your Honor.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, you were asked some questions on
cross-examination about at the time that Hayman received this
representation, whether you asked any additional questions
about selling shares of subsidiaries; is that correct?
A. No further questions were asked at the time of processing
the subdoc.
Q. But after the subdoc was processed, did Hayman and its
lawyers ask questions about the source of wealth?
A. About the source of wealth and the source of funds.
MR. FINKEL: If we can please pull up what's
been——what's in evidence as HN168, and go to the second page.
Q. And this document, these were some of the questions that
were asked to Saraca about the source of wealth, correct?
A. Source of wealth and source of funds.
Q. What's the difference between the two?
A. Source of wealth is how you created your money to be a



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Redirect
qualified purchaser; the source of funds is what funded your
investment into the vehicle.
Q. And the third bullet, it says: If the proceeds were
derived from a securities offering, did the offering documents
disclose the use of funds to include an investment in the fund,
meaning Hayman, or in any similar private fund vehicle? If
yes, please provide a copy of the disclosure statement. Did I
read that right?
A. Yes.
Q. Did Saraca ever provide offering documents in response to
this question?
A. No, they did not.
Q. Did Saraca provide any additional information to suggest
that they disclosed that the use of proceeds from a securities
offering would be used in Hayman?
A. No, they did not.
MR. FINKEL: If we can pull up HN208.
Q. This exhibit is another example of Hayman seeking
additional information about the investment?
A. Yes.
Q. And did Saraca ever respond to this?
A. They did not.
Q. And so in the second paragraph, the underlying text says:
In order to allow Saraca to remain invested in the fund, Hayman
needs to receive a representation from you and Saraca's lawyers



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Recross
regarding the specific source of this money (beyond what was
initially provided stated in the subscription documents) and
that this money is not tainted in any way, including that it
does not represent assets from the GTV offering, but that it is
a bona fide investment made by Saraca and Miles. Is that what
it says?
A. Yes.
Q. Did Hayman ever receive response to this?
A. We did not.
MR. FINKEL: Nothing further.
THE COURT: Recross?
MR. KAMARAJU: Just briefly, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could I have 168, please.
RECROSS EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. So Ms. Schottenheimer, the date of this email is July 15,
2020, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And the SEC had already contacted Hayman by this point,
right?
A. The 13th of July.
Q. Right. Right. And Mr. Finkel just asked you a number of
questions about whether you ever received a response, whether
Hayman received a response, right?
A. A formal response.



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Recross
Q. Right. Now sitting here today, you don't know what Mr. Je
and Saraca were doing during this period, right?
A. Correct.
Q. You don't know if they were consulting with lawyers, right?
MR. FINKEL: Objection. The Court ruled on that.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Okay. You testified during direct that Saraca had lawyers,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. You don't know if they were discussing the matter with the
SEC directly, right?
A. I would not have been privy to those conversations so I——I
don't know.
Q. Right. But you testified on direct that at some point you
wired the money back, right, some portion of it?
A. We wired money to an escrow account.
Q. Okay. An escrow account that was held by who?
A. It's my understanding they were Saraca's lawyers.
Q. Okay. And you did that with the blessing of the SEC,
right?
A. With no objections from the SEC or the DOJ.
Q. Or Saraca, for that matter, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And then you also testified that you liquidated the
$30 million position at some point, right?



O5V1GUO4 Schottenheimer - Recross
A. Yes.
Q. And that was 15 months later, right?
A. Would have been maybe late September, early October of
2021; 15 months, yup.
Q. And the SEC knew that that $30 million was there, right?
MR. FINKEL: Objection.
THE COURT: She cannot testify as to what the SEC
knew.
Q. The SEC had asked Hayman about that $30 million before,
right?
A. I was not a part of any of the direct conversations with
the SEC.
Q. But on direct you testified that when that $30 million was
ultimately liquidated, it was done with the consent of the SEC,
right?
A. It was my understanding at the time that there was no
objection from any of the parties, from——from the SEC.
Q. Okay. And on direct you said——I don't remember the exact
term, but——any of the interested parties, right?
A. Regarding the 70 million or the 30 million?
Q. 30 million.
A. I don't recall saying that about the 30 million.
Q. Okay. Anyone object to you liquidating the $30 million
position?
A. Not to my knowledge.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
Q. You never heard Saraca object to it?
A. At the time?
Q. At the time it was liquidated.
A. I don't know.
MR. KAMARAJU: No further questions, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: One question, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. Redirect examination.

BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Months later, when the SEC became involved, as you were
just asked about, at that time did anyone from Saraca respond
to the questions that Kit Addleman had asked and provide
documentation about the source of funds and source of wealth?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection to form.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.

O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
(At the sidebar)
MR. SCHIRICK: Your Honor, we just noticed a few
minutes before Mr. Fergenson stood up to speak that the
stipulation that covers the bank records that this witness is
going to put in was——there was a scrivener's error and we're
short one document, so we just wanted to put on the record the
defense will just stip to that coming in on the record even
though it's not in the stip. We just wanted to do that before
he started.
THE COURT: That's fine.
MR. SCHIRICK: So the defense stips to GX JPM121.
MR. FERGENSON: Great. Thank you. Thank you, your

THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Government's Exhibit Stip 14 received in evidence)
MR. FERGENSON: And I'll just read the stipulation, at
least part of it.
It is hereby agreed between the parties that the
below-listed exhibits were lawfully obtained by the government
and are authentic records of the entity listed in Column A that
were made at or near the time by, or from information
transmitted by, a person with knowledge of the matters set
forth in the records; such records were kept in the course of a
regularly conducted activity; and it was the regular practice
of that entity to make the records.
And the government will offer——actually, Ms. Loftus,

BY MR. FERGENSON:
Q. Ms. Espinoza, do you see under column A, there's an entry
towards the middle, it says JPMorgan Chase Bank?

O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
MR. FERGENSON: Could we please publish, Ms. Loftus.
BY MR. FERGENSON:
Q. Now, Ms. Espinoza, generally speaking, what do these charts
show?
A. These charts show an analysis of mainly two bank accounts
for Saraca Media Group, so it's going to show all the incoming
money and all the outcoming money from those two accounts.
Q. Now looking just at this first chart here, please explain
what we're looking at on this slide.
A. This is one of the bank accounts that I reviewed. The
account title is Saraca Media Group Inc. d/b/a Himalaya Dollar.
It's a Chase account ending in 5601. And as of April 1, 2020,
the beginning balance in the account was $206,133.
Q. Now Saraca Media Group Inc., do you know what that is?
A. I do not.
Q. It also has a name d/b/a Himalaya Dollar. What's d/b/a?
A. Doing business as.
Q. Do you know what Himalaya Dollar is?
A. I do not.
MR. FERGENSON: All right. Now let's go to the next
page, Ms. Loftus, please.
Q. Ms. Espinoza, could you read the title of this slide,
please.
A. Chase 5601: Signature Cards. And they're dated July 24,
2018, and May 21, 2020.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
Q. Chase 5601, is that the same account on the first slide we
looked at?
A. Yes, it is.
Q. What's a signature card?
A. Signature card is a document provided by the bank. It
gives all the account information, like the account title, the
number, when the account was opened, and then also the signer
on the account.
Q. What's an account signer?
A. It's the person who's authorized to use the bank account.
MR. FERGENSON: Ms. Loftus, if we could zoom in on the
left signature card first.
All right. Now, Ms. Espinoza, just focusing you first
on the top left here, what's the account title?
A. Saraca Media Group Inc.
Q. And beneath that, there's a business address, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Now focusing you on the top right, it lists an account
number. What are the last four listed there?
A. 5601.
Q. And beneath that, a couple lines, it says Date Opened.
What was the date this account was opened?
A. July 24, 2018.
Q. And focusing you towards the bottom of what's blown up
here, who is the signatory on this account?



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
A. Yanping Wang.
Q. Do you know who that is?
A. I do not.
Q. What was her title?
A. Acting secretary.
Q. And what's the date she signed this?
A. July 24, 2018.
MR. FERGENSON: All right. Ms. Loftus, if we could
zoom in on the right signature page.
Q. The one on the left was 2018, right? What's the date of
the one on the right?
A. May 21, 2020.
Q. Okay. Now focusing you again on the top left, what's the
account title?
A. Saraca Media Group Inc. d/b/a Himalaya Dollar.
Q. And focusing you on the right, what are the last four?
A. 5601.
Q. So same account, there's now a d/b/a on the account title?
A. Yes.
Q. All right. And again, on the signature page, who's the
signatory on this account?
A. Yanping Wang.
Q. What's her title?
A. President.
Q. And what was the date she signed this?



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
A. May 21, 2020.
Q. So Ms. Espinoza, throughout this account for the exhibits
you looked at, the authorized person was Yanping Wang.
A. Yes.
MR. FERGENSON: All right. Let's go to the third
page, Ms. Loftus.
Q. All right. Now are we just back at the first page that we
had looked at originally?
A. Yes.
Q. And on April 1, 2020, what's the beginning balance in the
Saraca 5601 account?
A. $206,133.
MR. FERGENSON: All right. Let's go to the next
slide, Ms. Loftus, please.
Q. Okay. Now Ms. Espinoza, please explain what we're looking
at on this slide.
A. This is showing, for the same Saraca account, 5601, from
April 1, 2020, through April 30, 2020, there are deposits
totaling $32,543,535, and it consists of 291 deposit
transactions. And they have references such as "GTV," "Stock,"
"Investment," and "Capital."
Q. There's some bracketed text at the bottom that says
"including misspellings and similar text." What does that
mean?
A. Some of the references or the memos had some misspellings,



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
and then additional words added to the front or the back.
Q. And I should have asked, when it says with references to,
what do you mean by reference?
A. A lot of the transactions were wire transfers, and so a
reference is similar to like a memo on a check, where you could
put——the sender could put a reason for why they are sending the
money.
MR. FERGENSON: Let's go to the next slide, please,
Ms. Loftus.
Q. Ms. Espinoza, please explain what we're looking at on this
slide.
A. These are four examples of those wire transfer deposits
that I was just speaking about, so there's two of them that are
occurring on April 24th, one on May 1st, and one on May 12th,
and the amounts are to the right, 300,000, 200,000, etc. And
then highlighted is the memos or references that I was just
referring to. So the top one says GTV Investment, the next one
says Investment Share Capital, the next one says Attention to
Mr. Miles Guo, and the last one says For GTV Stock.
Q. And are these all the reference lines or just some
examples?
A. Just some examples.
Q. Do you know what GTV is?
A. I do not.
MR. FERGENSON: Let's go to the next slide, please,



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
Ms. Loftus.
Q. Okay. Now what's shown on this slide now, Ms. Espinoza?
A. So this is the same Saraca account ending in 5601, so after
those deposits, for that one month, on April 30th, the ending
balance in the account is $32,474,168.
MR. FERGENSON: And let's go to the next slide,
Ms. Loftus.
Q. All right. Now what's shown here, Ms. Espinoza?
A. This is showing, for the same account, the Chase 5601, from
May 1, 2020, through May 29, 2020, there were deposits totaling
$291,554,689, it consisted of 2,446 deposit transactions, and
again, there were references to "GTV," "Stock," "Investment,"
"Private Placement," "Capital."
MR. FERGENSON: Let's go to the next slide, please,
Ms. Loftus.
Q. All right. So Ms. Espinoza, after those additional
incoming deposits referencing things like stock or private
placement, how much money is in the 5601 account now?
A. As of May 29, 2020, the ending balance is $313,213,772.
MR. FERGENSON: Ms. Loftus, please go to the next
slide.
Q. How much money was in this account as of June 3, 2020?
A. $928,401.
Q. And actually, I should ask, what was the balance on the
account the day before that?



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
A. 324,778,316.
Q. So approximately how much money left this account on
June 3rd?
A. About 323 to $324 million.
Q. Okay. Let's look at those transactions.
MR. FERGENSON: Ms. Loftus, if we could go to the next
slide, please.
You could scroll up. Thank you.
Q. All right. Ms. Espinoza, what's shown on this slide?
A. So this is that account, the Saraca Chase 5601 account. On
the top left, it's showing the same ending balance of
324 million, approximately, on June 2nd; and then this is
showing the outgoing transactions on June 3rd. So the three
red highlights are transfers to a checking account ending in
2038. So there's one transaction for a hundred million
dollars, another for $20 million, and another for $5 million.
    MR. FERGENSON: And——thank you, Ms. Loftus.
Q. So Ms. Espinoza, focusing you on the 2038 there, what does
the 2038 mean?
A. Those are the last four digits of a bank account.
Q. And are you able to tell whether that bank account was also
at Chase or at another bank?
A. It's at Chase.
Q. And approximately how much in total was transferred to that
account on June 3rd?




O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
A. $125 million.
Q. Okay. I want to focus on those transactions.
MR. FERGENSON: And Ms. Loftus, if we could go to the
next slide, please.
Q. All right. So what new information is on this slide,
Ms. Espinoza?
A. So this is adding that 2038 Chase Bank account. Looking at
the bank records for that account, the account title is Saraca
Media Group Inc. d/b/a Himalaya Dollar, and the account was
opened on June 3, 2020, which is the date of the transfers. So
as of that date, the beginning balance was $0.
Q. So both of these accounts are in the name of Saraca Media
Group d/b/a Himalaya Dollar, right?
A. Yes, they are.
Q. All right. Let's——and they're both at the same bank,
correct?
A. Yes.
MR. FERGENSON: Ms. Loftus, go to the next page,
please.
Q. All right. Now what's shown on this page, Ms. Espinoza?
A. This is the Chase Saraca account ending in 2038. This is
the signature card for that account.
MR. FERGENSON: Ms. Loftus, if we could just blow up
the——I don't know——top 2/3, make it a little easier to read.
Q. Now what was the date of the $125 million in transfers to



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
this account that we were looking at?
A. June 3, 2020.
Q. And what date was this account opened?
A. June 3, 2020.
Q. And who is the signatory on this account?
A. Yanping Wang.
Q. And what was her title?
A. President.
Q. What date did she sign this?
A. June 3, 2020.
Q. All the same date.
A. Yes.
MR. FERGENSON: All right. Let's go to the next
slide, please.
Q. Okay. Now, Ms. Espinoza, you testified there were three
transfers on this date, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. What's shown on this slide?
A. This is the first transfer, so it was a hundred million,
20 million, and 5 million, so this is the first transfer of a
hundred million dollars, which occurred at 3:17 p.m. on June 3,
2020.
Q. And this is the first transfer.
A. I'm sorry?
Q. Chronologically, is this the first transfer?



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
A. Yes.
MR. FERGENSON: Okay. Let's go to the next slide,
please.
Q. What are we looking at here, Ms. Espinoza?
A. These are the account details provided by the bank for that
$100 million transaction on June 3, 2020.
Q. And let me focus you first on the top left, so the bold
text. What's the date and time listed there?
A. June 3, 2020, 3:17 p.m.
Q. And to the right of, you know——to the right of that, it
says, Transferpmtadd. What does it say to the right of that?
A. Yvettewang2018.
Q. Now there's text highlighted in red, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And what is that text?
A. That is a memo, similar to a reference, and it states "GTV
Private Placement Fund."
Q. Do you know what the GTV private placement is,
Ms. Espinoza?
A. I do not.
MR. FERGENSON: All right. Let's go to the next
slide, please, Ms. Loftus.
Q. Okay. Now what's shown on this slide, Ms. Espinoza?
A. So this is what was shown previously. The 100——towards the
top, Saraca transfer of $100 million to another Saraca account



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
on June 3, 2020, and then there's $100 million transfer two
days later, on June 5, 2020, to Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities
at Citibank.
Q. And what are the last four digits of that Hayman Hong Kong
Opportunities bank account?
A. 9681.
Q. And Ms. Espinoza, I should ask, in the bottom center here,
there's a yellow box that list things like GX JPM119. What
does that show?
A. Those are the government exhibits that I looked at in order
to obtain the information on the chart.
Q. All right. Now I should also ask, do you know what Hayman
Hong Kong Opportunities Fund is?
A. I do not.
MR. FERGENSON: All right. Let's go the next slide,
please, Ms. Loftus.
Q. Okay. What's the new information in this slide,
Ms. Espinoza?
A. It's showing the tree——sorry——the three transfers between
Saraca. So there was one for $100 million at 3:17 p.m.,
another for $20 million at 3:18 p.m., and then another for
$5 million at 4:06 p.m., all on June 3, 2020.
MR. FERGENSON: And then——and Ms. Loftus, if we could,
maybe we can blow up the top right box.
Q. Okay. So $125 million goes to this account on June 3rd



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Direct
from the, you know, the box on the left, right?
A. Right. Correct.
Q. Why is the balance $138,200,000?
A. There is an additional amount that came from another
account.
Q. And there's an asterisk here, right?
A. Yes, and there's——
MR. FERGENSON: Ms. Loftus, if we zoom out. And maybe
we can blow up the yellow box down there.
Q. And could you please read the asterisk.
A. On June 3, 2020, Saraca Media Group JPMC account ending in
8656 transferred 13.2 million to Saraca Media Group JPMC
account ending in 2038.
Q. So another Saraca account transferred money to the 2038
account?
A. Yes.
Q. And it was about $13 million?
A. Yes.
MR. FERGENSON: Let's go to the next slide, please.
Q. All right. Now what's new on this slide?
A. This slide just totals those three transactions, so it
shows 125 million at the top between the two Saraca accounts.
MR. FERGENSON: And Ms. Loftus, let's go to the next
page, please.
Q. And what's new here, Ms. Espinoza?



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
A. So on June 3, 2020, there's also a $200 million transfer
between Saraca Media Group, the Chase account ending in 5601,
$200 million that's transferred at 6:12 p.m. on June 3, 2020 to
GTV Media Group Inc. d/b/a 7-Coin at Citibank.
Q. Now this d/b/a 7-Coin, do you know what 7-Coin is?
A. I do not.
MR. FERGENSON: All right. So could we please go to
the next slide, Ms. Loftus.
Q. What's new here, Ms. Espinoza?
A. There's an additional transfer from the Saraca Media Group
Chase account ending in 2038 for $38 million on June 9, 2020,
to GTV Media Group Inc. d/b/a 7-Coin.
Q. All right. So of the money that went into these two Saraca
accounts, approximately how much went to GTV Media Group Inc.?
A. $238 million.
Q. Where did the remaining $100 million go?
A. Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities.
MR. FERGENSON: May I have a moment, your Honor.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. FERGENSON: No further questions. Thank you.
THE COURT: Cross-examination?
MR. SCHIRICK: Thanks, your Honor.
CROSS EXAMINATION
BY MR. SCHIRICK:
Q. Good afternoon, Ms. Espinoza.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
A. Good afternoon.
Q. When did the government lawyers first ask you to testify in
this case?
A. About two to three weeks ago.
Q. You didn't know anything about the case before the
prosecutors reached out to you?
A. I heard of the name GTV Media, but I don't know any further
information other than that.
Q. Okay. But you didn't have any substantive information, you
just heard it from somewhere.
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Had you ever heard of the name Miles Guo before the
government reached out to you?
A. I heard of that name as well.
Q. But again, just because you had heard it from office talk,
right, you didn't know anything about him?
A. Yeah, I don't know anything about him.
Q. You weren't part of the FBI's investigative team in this
matter?
A. Just for the testimony I gave today.
Q. But the investigative team.
A. No, I'm not.
Q. And you weren't part of the prosecution team.
A. No.
Q. And you didn't investigate any of the money transfers that



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
you just testified to a moment ago. Putting the emphasis on
investigation. Did you investigate any of those transfers that
you testified to?
A. No, I didn't investigate.
Q. In fact, you haven't really had any involvement in this
case, I believe, as you testified to on direct, apart from
prepping for your testimony here today and then giving
testimony; is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. So really the only thing that you know about this case is
what the government has told you, right?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. It's not what was told to me. I actually reviewed a lot of
bank records in order to perform the analysis.
Q. Fair enough. So the only thing that you know about this
case is what the government has told you or told you to read;
is that correct?
A. Well, what the government has provided to me, but yes.
Q. Fair enough. So the only things that you know are what the
government has told you or provided to you.
A. Yes.
Q. Have you met with the prosecutors before today?
A. I have.
Q. How many times?



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
A. It was two phone calls and one in-person meeting.
Q. Okay. And do you remember when the first time was?
A. Approximately two to three weeks ago.
Q. Okay. So it's fair to say that you've been involved in
this case for no more than two to three weeks.
A. Correct.
Q. And you're trained as a forensic accountant, correct?
A. Yes, I am.
Q. Okay. And where did you go to school?
A. Queens College.
Q. And then did you work somewhere before you joined the FBI?
A. I did.
Q. And where was that?
A. I worked at the New York State Attorney General's Office
and I worked for a company called RGL Forensics.
MR. SCHIRICK: Okay. All right. If we could please
pull up Government Exhibit Z1.
Q. And you just testified to this chart a moment ago when you
were talking to Mr. Fergenson, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And can you tell me who created the first draft of
this chart?
A. So there were various versions of the exhibits. I was
given version 5. I know the FBI agents and other forensic
accountant, the prosecutors worked together in putting some of



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
these together.
Q. Okay. So the first——the first version of this document was
put together by someone other than you, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. And it sounds like perhaps the first five versions of this
document were put together by someone other than you, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. And it sounds like there were multiple members of the
government team, including lawyers, who helped put it together
before you reviewed this document; is that correct, to your
understanding?
A. Before I reviewed it, yes.
Q. And perhaps multiple other agents who contributed to the
first five drafts of this before you saw it, to your
understanding?
A. Before I saw the original, I just want to make that clear,
and not the final version, yes.
Q. Understood. Before you saw any draft of this document,
multiple other people had input to it before it was presented
to you, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. And after you were presented with the first draft, you and
the government lawyers talked about this exhibit, right?
A. I'm sorry. Me and who?
Q. The folks sitting here at counsel's table for the



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
government.
A. No. Actually, I spoke with the agents and another forensic
accountant about it.
Q. Okay. So you spoke to other agents and another forensic
accountant for the FBI before you spoke to government lawyers?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. Did a time come when you spoke to the government
lawyers about this chart?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And when was that?
A. Last Saturday.
Q. Okay. And did they make suggested revisions to the chart
when you spoke to them?
A. No, I actually made suggested revisions to the charts.
Q. Okay. So, understood. Is it fair to say that the chart
was created and mostly completed before you had an opportunity
to comment to it?
A. It was mostly completed and then I made edits to it.
Q. Right. But your edits were relatively small in relation to
the work that had been done before it was presented to you,
right?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. I don't know. I feel like it's relative. They were
important to me, the changes that I made. I changed an account



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
number, changed some amounts, so——
Q. Understood. You didn't go into PowerPoint and create this
document, though, right?
A. I went into PowerPoint and edited the document.
Q. And edited it, right?
A. Correct.
Q. It was presented to you as mostly complete, as you said
before, by the time you got to it.
A. Yes, a different version.
Q. Fair enough. I'd like to just talk briefly about the chart
and some of the information underlying the chart. Is it fair
to say that the chart focuses on a period of time April through
June of 2020?
A. April through June 3rd——well, June 9, 2020.
Q. Fair enough. I was going to just use the months for ease.
So April to June 2020.
A. Sure.
Q. Roughly.
A. Mm-hmm.
Q. Okay. And you testified that you reviewed the underlying
bank records for your testimony here today?
A. Yes.
Q. And you reviewed the underlying bank records that are
cited, as Mr. Fergenson pointed out, in the summary chart?
A. Yes.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
Q. Okay. And did you review any Saraca bank records from
JPMorgan that predated April 2020?
A. No.
Q. And did you review any JPMorgan bank records for Saraca
that postdated June 2020?
A. I don't believe so. I think it ended at June.
Q. Okay. So you have no idea, right, whether the bank account
at JPMorgan held by Saraca held substantial funds either before
or after the time period that you focused on, right?
A. Yeah, I just knew the beginning balance as of April.
Q. Okay. Apart from the Chase accounts that you looked at in
connection with helping to edit this chart, how many bank
accounts did Saraca have in the United States?
A. I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question.
Q. Sure. Apart from the bank accounts that you looked at in
connection with helping to edit this chart, do you know how
many other bank accounts Saraca had in the United States?
A. No. I only focused on the Chase accounts that I reviewed.
Q. Okay. And what about foreign bank accounts; didn't look at
any foreign bank accounts for Saraca, correct?
A. I was not provided with that, no.
Q. Okay. So at bottom, no information other than the
information you were provided with by the government is
reflected in this chart, right?
A. Correct.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
Q. All right. Let's just go back to the chart briefly. I'd
like to just take you through it and review a few of the
slides, if that's all right.
Overall, is it fair to say that we're talking
about——this chart, that is, is talking about money that came
into Saraca from the sale of GTV shares?
A. I do not know. This is money that came into Saraca. I'm
just showing the incoming money and the outgoing money.
Q. Okay. So you don't know that Saraca sold shares that it
held in GTV and that after selling that a portion of——
MR. FERGENSON: Objection.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. You testified on direct about a private placement; is that
right?
A. That was——
Q. About your knowledge of a private placement?
A. That was one of the memos on the checks.
Q. Okay. Do you know when the private placement began?
A. I don't know anything about a private placement.
Q. All right. Let's just walk through the chart.
I'm going to first just focus on the first nine pages
of Government Exhibit Z-1. Which should be in front of
everyone.
If we look at page 1, is it fair to say that this just
shows the opening balance of this first JPMorgan account on



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
April 1, 2020?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And then on page 2, this just shows who has
signature authority for that account?
A. Yes.
Q. And it looks like that signature authority was updated in
May of 2020?
A. Yes.
Q. And focusing on the——
MR. SCHIRICK: Yeah, if you could just blow that back
up. Thank you.
And also blow up the same line on the left-hand side
of the screen. The left-hand signature card. Thank you.
Q. And can you see here that, as you covered on direct, it's
the same individual is listed as the signatory to this account,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. Yanping Wang?
A. Yes.
Q. And it looks here as though she's just changed positions at
the company, right?
A. Yeah, it's a different title.
Q. So does that sort of explain why she might have updated the
signature card?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Do you have any understanding as to why one might update a
signature card on a bank account?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Okay. And if we turn to page 3, this is just the same as
page 1, right? No difference?
A. Correct.
Q. So it's sort of a dupe, right?
A. I'm sorry?
Q. So it's a dupe, it's duplicative, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And then turning to pages 4, 5, and 6——first of all,
take page 4, on this slide, it just shows how much money came
into this bank account in April 2020. That's it, really.
MR. FERGENSON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Well, there's a lot of details here, but yeah, it shows the
32 approximate million that came in in April.
Q. Right. Overall, that's just——that's what it's here for;
it's intended to show how much came in in April, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And then on page 5, this is just a little bit more
detail on the same thing, right?
A. Yes.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
Q. Okay. And then on page 6, this just shows the balance at
the end of April, right?
A. It does.
Q. Okay. Now let's take pages 7, 8, and 9.
Pages 7, 8, and 9 are really just the same thing that
we've looked at for pages 4, 5, and 6, but this time it's for
May of 2020, right?
A. Right.
Q. Okay. So is it fair to say that pages 1 through 9 of this
19-page chart just show money coming into Saraca's JPM
accounts?
MR. FERGENSON: Object to form.
THE COURT: It's overruled. You can answer.
A. Yeah, I mean, it shows all the deposits that came into the
account. It's very simplified in that it's——yeah, it's showing
the incoming money into the account, but there's a lot of
detail behind it.
Q. I understand there's more detail in the chart. My question
is: Don't pages 1-9 just show money coming into this account?
MR. FERGENSON: Asked and answered.
Q. For April——
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. All right. Now let's look at pages 10-14.
Page 10 here is something of a cover sheet that just
shows what's detailed in the following pages; is that correct?



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
A. Well, it shows the three transactions which we are about to
go over.
Q. Right. And——
A. And the following pages.
Q. Sure. And maybe it would be helpful——I'm sorry. We should
have just scrolled forward for you so you could see what was
coming up next.
MR. SCHIRICK: Maybe go one more. And one more.
Q. Did you have an opportunity to look at that?
A. Yeah, I mean, there's some additional information there,
like the signature card, but yeah, it is showing there's
$100 million transfer, which is one of the three transfers.
Q. Right. Okay.
MR. SCHIRICK: So if we go back up to page 10. So
this——I'm sorry. Let's move now to page 11.
Q. So this shows the opening of a new account at Chase by
Saraca; is that right?
A. Yes, the box to the right shows that.
Q. And it's in the exact same name as the other account; is
that right?
A. Yes.
Q. Saraca Media Group Inc. d/b/a Himalaya Dollar, right?
A. Yes.
MR. SCHIRICK: Okay. Let's flip to page 12.
Q. Now page 12 just shows who has signature authority for this



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
new Chase account, right?
A. Yes, it does.
Q. And it's the same person who had signatory authority for
the first Chase accounts, right?
A. Yes, it is.
Q. And in fact, it's the——reflects the same title for Ms. Wang
as the most updated signature card for the first account,
right?
A. Yes, it does.
Q. Okay. We can go back to page 2 if you want. But do you
recall that?
A. I believe so, yeah.
Q. Okay. All right. Now let's just focus a little bit on
what happened on June 3rd.
MR. SCHIRICK: If we can go back to page 10.
Q. So I believe you testified on direct that these
transactions on June 3rd reflected outgoing transfers. Do you
recall that?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Aren't these just online transfers from one account
at JP Morgan to another account at JPMorgan?
A. Yeah, those three that are highlighted are online transfers
to another checking.
Q. Right. So it's just moving money from one of Saraca's
accounts and working it into another one of Saraca's accounts



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
within JPMorgan, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And so there's nothing going out of the bank, right?
A. Not at that point yet, but eventually, yes.
Q. Fair enough. This is the one we're focusing on now. These
three transactions, nothing going out of the bank, right?
A. I'm not sure what you mean by that, because they are coming
out of the 5601 to go to the 2038 account.
Q. Understood. My question is: There are no transfers
leaving JPMorgan Chase, right?
A. The overall bank?
Q. Correct.
A. No.
Q. Okay. These are purely internal transfers within JPMorgan,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Isn't this the same thing as when I go into my online
account to move funds from a savings account to a checking
account?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Yes. It's a transfer.
Q. Right. It's the same thing, right?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
Q. Okay. So these are sister accounts within the same bank,
held by the same company.
MR. FERGENSON: Objection to the characterization.
THE COURT: Overruled.
A. They are the same bank account names at the same bank with
different account numbers.
Q. Okay. So this——these don't——these three transactions we're
looking at on slide 10 don't reflect wire transfers, right?
A. I mean, it's a transfer.
Q. You're aware of the difference between a transfer and a
wire transfer, correct?
A. Yeah.
Q. A wire transfer, am I right, is an outbound transaction
from a bank outside of the bank?
A. Yes, but these are still transfers in between the accounts.
Q. So my question——so if I was unclear, my question is: These
are not wire transfers, the three transactions we're looking on
on slide 10, that are highlighted.
MR. FERGENSON: Asked and answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MR. SCHIRICK: I'm not sure I got an answer to that
question, your Honor.
Q. Are these ACH transfers?
A. These are online transfers.
Q. So is that no, they're not ACH transfers?



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
A. That is how JPMorgan Chase characterizes them, as online
transfers.
MR. SCHIRICK: Okay. Can we please pull up Government
Exhibit JPM119.
At 48.
And if we could please just zoom in on the top of the
document, the transfers that are——yup, there we go. If you
just move it up a little bit, please, to highlight the——thank
you.
BY MR. SCHIRICK:
Q. So can you see this document?
A. Yes.
Q. And doesn't this reflect——I'm sorry. Withdrawn.
Are these——is this document among the documents that
are the source for the information that's in the chart?
A. Yes, it is.
Q. Okay. And these are among the documents that you looked at
as part of editing the chart?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And you can see here that all three transfers are
characterized as online transfer to checking?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Does that make it clear to you that these are purely
internal transfers within JPMorgan?
MR. FERGENSON: Asked and answered.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
THE COURT: Sustained.
MR. SCHIRICK: Okay. If we could go back to the
summary chart. Page 14, please.
Q. So this particular slide shows some additional detail on
that internal transfer at Chase, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. And you testified to that on direct, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And again, in this internal transfer, what's written in the
memo section when this money gets zapped from one account to
another?
A. GTV Private Placement Fund.
Q. Right. Do you agree with me that that's an accurate
description of the funds, or you don't know?
A. An accurate description? That is the description provided
by the bank. And the bank records are accurate, to my
knowledge.
Q. Okay. So you don't have any reason to believe that this
was an inaccurate description of the funds that were
transferred internally at JPMorgan?
A. No.
Q. Okay. So the transfer is made from one account at JPMorgan
to another account; the source of the funds is totally
transparent as between those two accounts, right?
A. I'm not sure what you mean by that.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
Q. Well, there can't be any question, when money is moved
purely from one account at a bank to another account at a bank,
where the money came from, right?
A. Yeah, no, it says which account it came from and which
account it went to, if that's what you're stating.
Q. So the source of the funds is transparent, right?
A. It's——it's in the details, yes.
Q. Okay. Thank you. And the nature of the funds is described
in this memo line that we're looking at on page 14 of this
document, right?
A. I don't know about the nature of the funds. That is the
memo that is inputted by the person that made the transfer.
Q. So if we look at the balance of the chart beginning with
page 15, would you agree with me that the remaining pages of
the chart show what actual money flows out of Saraca's bank
account?
A. Yes, the remaining charts show outgoing money.
Q. Okay.
A. From Saraca.
Q. I'm sorry.
A. From Saraca.
Q. Thank you. And would you agree with me that there are two
main flows of money out of Saraca's bank account?
A. There are two entities that received the money, but there
are several——it consists of several transactions.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
Q. So my question is: Are there two principal flows in, in
two directions of the money?
A. Well, the flows would be the arrows to me, and so there is
one, two, three——there's like four arrows and the end chart.
Q. Is it fair to say that between June 3rd and June 9th,
$238 million from Saraca are moved to GTV Media Group?
A. Could you go through the last exhibit, the last slide.
Q. Sure.
A. And could you repeat the question.
Q. Sure. Is it fair to say that between June 3rd and
June 9th, $238 million go from Saraca to GTV Media Group?
A. Yes, that's correct.
Q. Okay. And is it also true that on June 5th, there is a
flow of funds from Saraca to Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities
Fund, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's in the amount of $100 million, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And when the money that leaves JPMorgan and goes to
Hayman, that money comes from an account at JPMorgan that is
titled identically to the first account at JPMorgan, right?
A. Yes, they're both Saraca accounts.
Q. Okay. And the account signatory on this account, Ms. Wang,
is exactly the same as on the first account.
A. Of the Saraca account, yes.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
Q. So no less information is available to Hayman in this
transfer than if the funds had simply come from the first
account, right?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Ms. Espinoza, nothing about the funds coming from this
second account at JPMorgan concealed anything; is that right?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Does this flow of funds obscure the source of funds in any
way?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MR. SCHIRICK: Your Honor, if I could just have a
moment.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. SCHIRICK: Your Honor, may I approach.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. SCHIRICK: Oh, no, I meant just approach the
witness, your Honor, not a sidebar.
Your Honor, it turns out we need a sidebar.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Continued on next page)



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
(At the sidebar)
MR. SCHIRICK: Your Honor, I would like to mark this
as Defense Summary Exhibit 1, and we would show it to the
witness as our only summary chart of the flow of funds that
essentially summarizes what's in her summary chart. And the
government objects.
THE COURT: Objects?
MR. SCHIRICK: Yes.
THE COURT: How come?
MR. FERGENSON: They didn't——this was the first we
heard they were marking it as an exhibit. They wanted to show
it to her and ask her if it's accurate. There's no failure of
recollection. It's not being used to refresh. If they're
trying to offer it as a summary exhibit, I guess they can ask
her if it's accurate, but we'll see what she says. If she says
this is accurate, then they can seek to offer it, I guess.
MR. SCHIRICK: That's my point, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. So on that prior issue of
hypotheticals to Ms. Schottenheimer, if the prosecution plans
to ask, say, for example, Mr. Bass or some other witness in
this category this type of hypothetical, I'd like you to
provide me with the authority.
MR. FINKEL: Understood. Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
(In open court)
MR. SCHIRICK: May I approach the witness, your Honor.
THE COURT: You may.
MR. SCHIRICK: I'm handing the witness a copy of
what's been marked as Defense Summary Exhibit 1.
BY MR. SCHIRICK:
Q. Just take a moment to review that.
Ms. Espinoza, have you had an opportunity to review
what's been marked as Defense Summary Exhibit No. 1?
A. Yes.
Q. Does this describe the flow of funds that is also described
in the summary exhibit that the government asked you about on
direct?
A. Well, it removes some of the flow of funds and some of the
transfers.
Q. Well, it certainly removes some of the detail, correct?
A. Yes, it does.
Q. Would you agree for me that the net effect of the transfers
is the same in this exhibit as in the exhibit that the
government introduced?
A. The outgoing totals——I don't know about net effect, but the
outgoing totals to GTV Media and to Hayman are the same
amounts.
Q. Okay. That's a better formulation, so I will adopt your
formulation.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
Are the outgoing totals, the net amounts that go to
Hayman and GTV correct in this exhibit?
A. Yes. The outgoing amounts are the same amounts.
MR. SCHIRICK: Okay. Your Honor, the defense offers
this exhibit into evidence.
MR. FERGENSON: Your Honor, may I have voir dire for a
moment.
THE COURT: You may.
VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION
BY MR. FERGENSON:
Q. Ms. Espinoza, is that summary chart an accurate summary of
the final summary of GX Z1, the summary chart you testified to?
A. No, it's taking out a lot of the details and some of the
transfers.
MR. FERGENSON: The government objects, your Honor.
THE COURT: So are you seeking to admit it for the
limited purpose that the witness has stated?
MR. SCHIRICK: Correct, your Honor. We're not
offering it——clearly it doesn't have the detail that the
government's exhibit has, but the witness has testified that
the net amount of the flows in the exhibit that we've offered
is correct.
MR. FERGENSON: We object, because the witness just
testified it's not an accurate summary of the summary that's in
evidence, your Honor.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Cross
MR. SCHIRICK: Your Honor, my summary doesn't need to
be an accurate version of their summary. I'm allowed to have
my own summary. The defense can have its own summary.
THE COURT: So is your question whether or not this
chart shows the net outflow; is that the question?
MR. SCHIRICK: Correct. The witness has testified
that the amount of outflows from the JPMorgan account to Hayman
on one hand and to GTV on the other hand are correct, are
accurate in that exhibit, and we offer it for that purpose.
THE COURT: All righty. It is admitted then.
MR. SCHIRICK: Thank you, your Honor.
(Defendant's Exhibit Summary 1 received in evidence)
MR. SCHIRICK: We have only——because we just handwrote
that, we have only one copy. We will provide additional copies
to the Court. Can we publish it.
THE COURT: It's 2:44.
MR. SCHIRICK: Thank you, your Honor. We're finishing
up momentarily.
BY MR. SCHIRICK:
Q. So Ms. Espinoza, does this chart——again, does this
accurately summarize the flow of funds at issue in the chart
that the government introduced?
A. It shows the correct amounts that went to GTV Media and to
Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities, but again, it leaves out a lot
of the details about the transactions.



O5V1GUO4 Espinoza - Redirect
Q. Understood. But this is really pretty simple, isn't it, at
the end of the day?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection.
THE COURT: Sustained. She's answered the question.
MR. SCHIRICK: Thank you, your Honor. No further
questions.
MR. FERGENSON: I have two questions, your Honor.
THE COURT: All righty.
MR. FERGENSON: Ms. Loftus, can we put up GX Z1.
GX Z1, at 19, please.
REDIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MR. FERGENSON:
Q. Ms. Espinoza, is there more information on this chart than
the handwritten one the defense just showed you?
A. Yes.
Q. Is this chart accurate?
A. Yes.
Q. Does it have all the relevant information?
A. Yes, it does.
Q. You were also asked a question about how the $100 million
transfer from Saraca to another Saraca account had the memo
line GTV Private Placement Fund. Do you recall that?
A. Yes.
Q. Focusing you on the $100 million transfer from Saraca to
Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities, did you review any records that



O5V1GUO4

showed a memo line of GTV Private Placement Fund?
MR. SCHIRICK: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. I don't recall the wire details for that transaction.
MR. FERGENSON: Nothing further, your Honor.
THE COURT: All righty. Let me——recross?
MR. SCHIRICK: Briefly, your Honor.
RECROSS EXAMINATION
BY MR. SCHIRICK:
Q. You just testified, Ms. Espinoza, that you didn't review
any wire details for that internal JPMorgan transfer, correct?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection, your Honor,
mischaracterizing.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MR. SCHIRICK: I believe she used the word "wire,"
your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Was the internal transfer at JPMorgan a wire?
MR. FERGENSON: Asked and answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MR. SCHIRICK: No further questions, your Honor.
THE COURT: All righty. Nothing further.
MR. FERGENSON: Correct.
(Witness excused)
THE COURT: Members of the jury, it's 2:46. Time to



O5V1GUO4

go. I just want to remind you that you're not allowed to
discuss the case amongst yourselves or with anyone else. You
can't permit anyone to discuss the case in your presence. In
addition, you're not allowed to research anything about the
case. It's very tempting, now that you've heard some witness
testimony, to want to go to Google or the library or any other
source to do some research. You cannot research anything
related to the case, and you cannot listen to any media reports
about the case from any source.
Have a good weekend. I look forward to welcoming you
back on Monday, promptly at 9:30.
THE LAW CLERK: Jury exiting.
(Jury not present)
THE COURT: You may be seated.
Is there anything before we reconvene on Monday?
MR. FERGENSON: Not from the government, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor, not for the defense.
Thank you.
THE COURT: Have a good weekend.
(Adjourned to June 3, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.)
