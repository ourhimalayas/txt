(Trial resumed; jury not present)
THE COURT: Good morning. Would you make your
appearances, please.
MR. HORTON: Good morning, your Honor. Justin Horton,
Ryan Finkel, Juliana Murray, Micah Fergenson for the
government. We're joined by paralegal Isabel Loftus and Robert
Stout from the FBI.
MR. KAMARAJU: Good morning, your Honor. Sid Kamaraju
and Scott Schirick on behalf of Mr. Guo. My understanding is
Mr. Guo is just in the bathroom.
THE COURT: All right. So we'll wait till he comes
out. Please be seated.
(Defendant present)
THE COURT: So last night the defense submitted a
letter with respect to hearsay exceptions, which deserves a lot
of attention, and I'd like to discuss the three hearsay
exceptions which they mention. I know that the prosecution has
not yet responded to the letter.
So the first exception mentioned is statements that
are offered for their impact on the defendant, and as an
example, defense counsel mentions a conversation concerning
misuse of funds. So we had one witness, Mr. Zhou, who spoke
about a videoconference where the misuse of funds was raised.
How is it that Mr. Guo's statements about the misuse of funds
would have an impact on him?




MR. KAMARAJU: Your Honor, just for the record,
Mr. Guo is now here at counsel's table.
The——I think you have to take those two in tandem,
your Honor, the first example we gave and the second example we
gave.
THE COURT: But I want you to stick with the first
example.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay.
THE COURT: Impact on the defendant.
MR. KAMARAJU: Sure. So an example of that, your
Honor, would be, if the defendant said, "Oh, my gosh, I can't
believe the funds were stolen," then that is evidence of the
impact that other people's statements had on him.
THE COURT: Yes. But we're talking about the witness
speaking about Mr. Guo's statements about misuse of funds.
That's what I thought you were getting at.
MR. KAMARAJU: Well, my point, your Honor, is, in the
example I just gave, Mr. Guo's statement was made in response
to another party's statement, right, and so it's——his statement
is evidence of the impact that the speaker's statement had on
him. It caused, in that specific example——and again, as we
said in our letter, we're not trying to revisit any of those
rulings, but if it caused Mr. Guo to take an action, right, if
it caused him to make a phone call, right, if it caused him
to——if it caused him to say something or send a direction, that




is evidence of impact that it had on Mr. Guo.
THE COURT: So I'd like to hear from the government
about that.
MR. FERGENSON: Yes, your Honor.
So the way this typically works, this kind of state of
mind exception, would be——
THE COURT: This is impact on the defendant.
MR. FERGENSON: Correct.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. FERGENSON: Which would be someone, an
out-of-court declarant, saying something to the defendant, not
the defendant saying something to other people.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. FERGENSON: That's the framework.
THE COURT: The word "impact," it necessarily means
that an individual is the object of something. You are being
impacted by, you are receiving the action.
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes. Yes, your Honor. But where I'm
going is that the statement, the defendant's statement can
still be evidence of the impact that someone else's statement
has on him, right? I'm not quibbling with the fact that impact
suggested a third party's acting in a way that is influencing
Mr. Guo. I'm just saying that Mr. Guo's statement can be
evidence of that influence.
MR. FERGENSON: Just briefly, your Honor.




THE COURT: Yes.
MR. FERGENSON: If that were the rule, or if that were
the exception, it would swallow the rule, because it's hard to
imagine a situation where an actor, the defendant, is not
speaking in response to something. And so if any time he
speaks, it's evidence of his state of mind, then you're
basically disregarding the hearsay rules for anything the
defendant said, because you could always say, well, anything he
said is reflective of his state of mind. That's not the way
the rules of evidence work. It's not how the hearsay rules
work. There are cases like the ones they cited where something
is said to the defendant and that had an effect on the
defendant, or at least the defense is entitled to argue that it
did, and that out-of-court statement comes in. And it's not
the case that any time the defendant spoke, it's a reflection
of his state of mind and it can disregard the hearsay rules to
have the defendant essentially testify without taking the stand
throughout the trial. It's not——it's not an opposing party
statement, like when the government elicits the defendant's
statements, and the hearsay rules preclude them from doing
that. That's——it's kind of Trial 101, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: Well, so, first of all, I think DiMaria
addressed that argument that Mr. Fergenson just made, but the
state of mind exception——which is not the one that your Honor
was asking about——but the state of mind exception has a




carveout built into it, so that's what Mr. Fergenson is talking
about. Your Honor is focused on impact, the impact part of our
letter. My point is simply that if there is a statement made
by the defendant that is being offered for a reason other than
its truth, and so in that case we were using it as an example
of impact, but a statement that evinces his desire to do
something in response to a statement.
THE COURT: No. But we're talking about a witness who
is quoting your client. The witness says, "Mr. Guo said we
should investigate the misuse of funds."
MR. KAMARAJU: Right.
THE COURT: So the question is: How does Mr. Guo's
statement impact himself?
MR. KAMARAJU: But that, I don't think——respectfully,
your Honor, I don't think our formulation is that Mr. Guo's
statement impacts himself. I think our formulation is that
Mr. Guo's statement is evidence of the impact that another
statement had on him. That's not being offered for the truth;
that's being offered for solely the reaction that it caused in
Mr. Guo.
THE COURT: But in this case, your position is that
Mr. Guo indeed wanted to have an investigation carried out
against Sara Wei, and so isn't it being offered for the truth
of the matter asserted, that he's directing that an
investigation be undertaken, and that's part of your defense?




MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor, because that would
fall, in our view, into the second example we gave, which is an
order or direction, and an order or direction is not hearsay.
THE COURT: Well, so we're in the command exception
now. I was in the impact exception. So——
MR. KAMARAJU: Well——I'm sorry, your Honor. My
apologies. I didn't mean to interrupt.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, I was only——I only brought up the
command because your Honor brought up the concept of
investigation of Sara Wei, so that was just the example that we
used in connection with the second prong. So that's why I went
to the command angle of it.
THE COURT: Right. The statement, "I understand that
there may be a misuse of funds and that should be
investigated," that in and of itself is not a command. If he
states, "You should investigate it, you must undertake an
investigation," that is a command.
MR. KAMARAJU: Well, that's what we were trying to
elicit was that he did say this should be looked into.
THE COURT: I understand the command exception. I
just don't comprehend the impact exception that you're making
out, and I invite you to submit authority that discusses a
defendant's own statement's impact on himself.
MR. KAMARAJU: I don't think I'll have that authority,




your Honor, because that's not our——as I think your Honor
knows, because that's not our argument.
THE COURT: Well, your argument is that the
defendant's statement reflects the impact another person's
statement had on him.
MR. KAMARAJU: So maybe I can try to do a clearer
example. And I recognize that is not this case, but I'm just
trying to use what might be a familiar example.
In a——in support of a duress defense, right, a
defendant may be able to say, or you may be able to elicit
testimony from a third-party witness that another party
threatened the defendant unless they took the action that the
government charged them with, right? That could come in as a
state of mind, but it could also come in as an example of
impact. Now the way the defendant's statement in that scenario
might come in is, if the defendant says, "Oh, no, I'm terrified
of that." If they expressed fear, right, that would be
evidence of the impact that the threatener's statement is
having on the defendant. And that's——I mean, that's how you
make out a duress defense, right, in the absence of the
defendant's testimony. So that's an example of a defendant's
statement being an example of the impact that it had on him,
which is our formulation. We're not trying to say that
Mr. Guo's statements impacted himself in some way. I recognize
that that would be circular.




THE COURT: Okay. So I'll hear from the government
with respect to the defense contention that commands are
exceptions to the hearsay rule. And I will permit you, of
course, to do your own research. I know that you may not have
completed that yet.
MR. FERGENSON: Yes, your Honor. Just as a general
matter, that's correct. I think as everyone recognizes, the
devil is in the details at times. And just to take an example,
the one that we were discussing just a moment ago, your Honor,
a statement like, "This should be investigated," that is close
to a command but not exactly. The command would be,
"Investigate this." But some kind of general pontificating on
"This should be investigated" is not——I don't think that, you
know——we're kind of dealing with these examples on the fly. I
don't think that would fall under the command exception. But
as a general principle, it is correct, you know, Mr. Kamaraju
is correct that commands are not hearsay.
THE COURT: All righty. So I don't recall how, during
Mr. Zhou's testimony, any command was dealt with by myself. I
just don't recall it in the transcript. And so we can go back
and we certainly can alter my ruling to reflect the command
exception to the hearsay rule, but I of course invite you to
review the transcript and identify where that took place.
MR. KAMARAJU: Well, that's fine, your Honor. We're
happy to do it. We're happy to identify the places for the




Court. We truly——we truly intended this to be a prospective
issue simply because we——given the government's hearsay
objections, we expect that this is going to come up over and
over again. So it's not that we're requesting the Court go
back and revise any of its rulings. That witness has been
excused. We're not asking to call him back or anything like
that. Just given what we've seen in the 3500 material, what we
anticipate our cross-examination being, and given the
government's perspective on hearsay, we just wanted to be clear
so that the Court had our position for the record.
THE COURT: All right. So now we go to the state of
mind exception. If you could explain your position on that.
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes, your Honor.
So the state of mind, so obviously, the case we cited,
United States v. DiMaria , the state of mind exception is
triggered when the defendant's statement is offered to prove
their then-existing state of mind. It cannot, just by rule, as
everyone knows, be used to introduce a statement about a
past-remembered belief. So from our perspective, if Mr. Guo
made a statement like——I'll use the DiMaria example again. So
in DiMaria , when the agents came to arrest him, the defendant,
the defendant said, "Why are you guys here? I'm just here to
get some cheap cigarettes." So the Court in that case said
that is indicative of his state of mind for why he thought he
was there.




THE COURT: For?
MR. KAMARAJU: Why the defendant believes he was
there. That was his state of mind, his present, existing state
of mind for why he was there. So from our perspective, there
could be similar testimony where we could cross-examine a
witness who might make a statement, for example, about Mahwah,
right, and Mr. Guo's belief at the time, during the period of
the conspiracy, about Mahwah and its use. That——and again,
we'd have to see what the testimony is, but that would be an
example of a state of mind exception.
THE COURT: So you're saying that if a witness were on
the stand and the witness states Mr. Guo said the premises is
used for these given purposes, that that statement should come
in to show his state of mind?
MR. KAMARAJU: At the time, your Honor, yes. It
cannot come in——if he tried to say——if we tried to elicit
testimony that said, you know, in 2023 he's reflecting back on
a purchase from 2021, we're not saying that is a state of mind
exception. But for his present, then-existing state of mind,
yes.
THE COURT: I'll hear from the government on that.
MR. FERGENSON: Again, very difficult to deal in the
abstract with this, but we are concerned, as we said at the
outset, that the defense's interpretation of this exception
would swallow the rule such that pretty much anything the




defendant said ever, they could elicit through, you know——offer
through our witnesses. That's not the way the hearsay
exception works, your Honor. It's very difficult to address it
in the abstract, and we haven't had much time to digest their
letter, but I think there's a real concern that it would——the
exception would swallow the rule.
THE COURT: So I want to understand when a hearsay
statement, an out-of-court statement by Mr. Guo would not be
showing his state of mind. Give me an example of that.
MR. KAMARAJU: Well, I mean, first of all, the rule
defines an example of that, right? Which is past
recollections. That's one example, right? But let me put it
this way. What the government's argument basically collapses
to is that the Court should read out the state of mind
exception because they think it's too broad. That's not the
way that works.
THE COURT: Well, the Court is trying to figure out
when the Court should read in the exception.
MR. KAMARAJU: Well, I agree, and as I said, your
Honor, it certainly turns on the particular statement. So my
example was one of, during the period of the conspiracy, when
they say renovations are happening, right, if Mr. Guo says, oh,
you know, I like this for the G/CLUBS members or whatever,
first of all, that's relevant, right? And secondly, it shows
his then existing state of mind during a relevant time period,




not in the past. We're not talking about future action, which
is a separate hearsay exception; we're talking about at that
moment in time, that's what Mr. Guo believes, right? So to me,
trying to determine what is read in——and your Honor is right,
you can't do that in the abstract, but I think the example I
just gave, then it is very clearly then-existing state of mind.
THE COURT: We'll revisit this. We'll revisit this.
And of course the government will have an opportunity to submit
authority on this, and of course I invite you, Mr. Kamaraju, to
submit any further authority to guide the Court.
MR. KAMARAJU: I appreciate that, your Honor, and I'll
certainly try.
THE COURT: Is there anything else before we have the
jurors come in?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
MR. FERGENSON: It's not——I don't believe it's
pressing before the jury comes in, your Honor, but the defense
did submit a motion for reconsideration of your Honor's expert
rulings. You know, I think we would ask to have at least until
Monday to file a response to that, your Honor.
THE COURT: That's fine.
MR. FERGENSON: And secondly, just one housekeeping
matter that I will keep short. I don't——I think given the
schedule, we probably won't get to the testimony of Mr. Shamel
Medrano. He's a summary witness of the government, introducing




a large volume of videos and G News posts. That was the
subject of our letter that your Honor ruled on yesterday. He's
introducing a summary chart that's a little over 200 pages.
And we prepared hard-copy binders for the Court, for the jury,
for defense, and also for the court reporters, that we would——I
don't think we'll get to his testimony today, but wanted to
just alert the Court to that, that, you know, prior to his
testimony, we might want to put those binders underneath the
jurors' chairs or hand them out at the beginning, if that was
all right with your Honor.
THE COURT: That's fine.
MR. FERGENSON: The one other thing with that
testimony is there's——I will also——there's so many exhibits
that we'll be offering pursuant to stipulations, that we're
grateful for the defense in helping us reach agreement on, that
we were hoping to hand out just a page listing out all the
government exhibits so the court reporter and the Court can
follow along while I read them out, if that is also all right
with your Honor.
THE COURT: Very handy. Thank you.
MR. FERGENSON: Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT: We are going to have our sidebars on this
side of the bench going forward.
MR. KAMARAJU: That makes sense to us, your Honor.
It's a little close to the witness and the jury otherwise.




THE COURT: All right. So we will return at 9:30.
ALL COUNSEL: Thank you, your Honor.
(Recess)
MR. HORTON: Your Honor, if I may just raise something
briefly before the jury comes in.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
MR. HORTON: We were handed a document a moment ago
that we understand the defense intends to offer through
Ms. Maistrello. It is a document that postdates her
employment. We don't think there's any way that she can
authenticate it. It postdates her employment. There's no
author indicated on the document except Golden Spring Ltd. It
appears to be a corporate document.
So setting aside the authentication issue, although
that's, of course, a threshold issue, this is a two-page
statement of the defendant's agent. It's exactly the kind of
hearsay that we've been talking about, and it's clearly offered
for its truth. It's a two-page explanation of the purpose of
the security team at Golden Spring. So we want to bring that
to the Court's attention and object to it.
THE COURT: So is the defense planning to use it to
refresh her recollection?
MR. HORTON: Well, it postdates her employment, and——
THE COURT: Yes, but anything can be used to refresh a
recollection.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
MR. HORTON: Of course. I understand.
THE COURT: That would, of course, be the only reason
that document could be put before the witness, and I know that
Ms. Shroff knows that.
MS. SHROFF: I do know that, your Honor. That is
exactly what I would use the document for. Thank you.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty. Please have the jurors
brought in.
(Continued on next page)



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
(Jury present)
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, I believe we're missing one
person.
THE COURT: The witness? Yes, yes, the witness will
also come in.
Good morning, jurors.
THE JURORS: Good morning.
THE COURT: Welcome back. Please be seated.
Good morning. And remember that you're still under
oath.
You may continue with the cross-examination.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you, your Honor.

MR. HORTON: Same objection, your Honor. This was
covered yesterday.
THE COURT: Overruled.
A. Can you repeat the question, please.
Q. Sure. You told the FBI that you were aware that the assets
in Golden Spring New York came from both the Middle East and
Hong Kong, correct?
A. I knew there were transfers from Golden Spring Hong Kong to
Golden Spring New York, yes.
Q. And you also knew that there were transfers from the Middle
East to Golden Spring New York and you told the FBI that,
correct? You remember that?
A. I knew that there were transfers to various companies.
Q. Right. And by transfer, you mean money coming in, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. And you recall telling the FBI that you were



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
perfectly aware that those transfers paid for Mr. Go's personal
and political expenses, correct?
A. I don't remember that.
Q. Okay. Well, let me see if I can help you refresh your
recollection.
THE COURT: One moment, please.
Go ahead.
Q. Does that document refresh your recollection?
A. I've never seen this document before.
Q. Let me try it this way.
THE COURT: We're getting a little bit of feedback
here and so——
MS. SHROFF: I know.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
Q. Ma'am, you recall your meetings with——
THE COURT: All right. We're still getting the
feedback.
All right. Let's try again.
Q. Does this document refresh your recollection?
A. Are you referring to a specific paragraph?
Q. Sure. The paragraph I hope that is now highlighted for
you.
THE COURT: So you're not to read anything out loud.
The question is whether or not the document refreshes your
recollection.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
A. Yes.
MS. SHROFF: Okay. You can take that down.
Q. And when you started at Golden Spring, Mr. Guo asked you to
research something called DDS attacks; do you remember that?
A. I do.
Q. And what are DDS attacks? Could you tell the jury, please.
A. Those were cyber attacks that, according to Boss, were done
by the CCP to——to his platforms.
Q. And there were also attacks to Golden Spring platforms,
correct?
A. What do you mean by Golden Spring platforms?
Q. I mean emails to Golden Spring.
A. What I was asked to investigate was specifically about Guo
Media, not Golden Spring.
Q. Okay. So you were asked to look into or investigate the
distributed denial of service attacks on Guo Media platforms,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And you did that along with the help of a gentleman
named Raj Benraj (ph), correct? Or is it Benraja? I'm not
sure.
A. Raj is his name.
Q. Right. That's his first name, right, and Benraj is his
last name? Do you recall that?
A. No, that is not his last name.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
Q. And there was also an ongoing concern about the email
addresses used by Golden Spring, correct?
A. I don't know about that.
Q. You don't recall William Gertz being on the board and
asking for Proton Mail to be used?
MR. HORTON: Objection.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Do you know who William Gertz is?
A. I do.
Q. Who is that?
A. He is a journalist and he was a member of Rule of Law
Society board.
Q. Right. And that's the board that you served on, correct,
Rule of Law Society board, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. You had nothing to do with Rule of Law Foundation, correct?
A. I was not on that board, no.
Q. Right. You had no job on that——in that nonprofit, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. So let's just go back to the email system used while
communicating with you as a Golden Spring employee, okay?
A. Okay.
Q. Okay. And do you recall Mr. Gertz, as a board member,
talking to you about which email system to use?
A. I don't remember.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
Q. Do you remember getting an email from Mr. Gertz saying that
he felt that Proton Mail was more secure because of the cyber
attacks experienced by both Golden Spring and by Rule of Law
Society?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor. Hearsay.
THE COURT: Ms. Shroff, do not elicit hearsay
testimony.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, it's not going for the truth,
it's simply going to show——
THE COURT: If you're going to make an objection, or
respond to an objection, you need to do it at the sidebar.
MS. SHROFF: Okay. I apologize, your Honor.
(Continued on next page)



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: So what is the purpose of the question?
MS. SHROFF: Well, your Honor, the government elicited
that Proton Mail was used. I think——I can't remember whose
direct this was on, but Proton Mail was somehow used because
people wanted to maintain secrets. I'm entitled to show that
there were, one, concerns about the cybersecurity at both
Golden Spring and the cybersecurity issues at Rule of Law
Society, that she was aware of the cyber issues, one of the
board members had specifically asked to use Proton Mail to have
secure engagement. The document is not being offered for the
truth. The documents are also email exchanges between her and
the board, maintained in the regular course of business, which
would also be an exception to the hearsay rule. So for those
reasons, I asked her whether or not she had an awareness that
one of her board members wanted to use Proton Mail. And I
asked her if she could recall it, and if she can't recall it,
I'm entitled to refresh her recollection. That's what I was
trying to ask.
MR. HORTON: So we did not elicit testimony about the
purpose, if any, of using Proton Mail. It came in through
Louie Bonsukan, who was a salesperson or a customer
representative at a car dealership in Texas, who testified the
fact of a Proton email address in a document that we discussed
with him. The car dealership certainly doesn't know the



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
purpose for which anybody outside of the dealership was using
that Proton email. So that testimony did not come in the way
it was described. Ms. Shroff did elicit that, like,
Ms. Maistrello had heard from Bill Gertz that he wanted to use
Proton Mail. That's in. This further long statement about
Bill Gertz talking at length about the reason he wanted to use
it and Bill Gertz's thoughts and Bill Gertz's statements,
that's hearsay, and that's why it's coming in. It's coming in
to prove the truth of what Bill Gertz, who is not here, was
saying.
MS. SHROFF: It's coming in to show that the
government, when it elicited the fact that purchase of the car
was made through a Proton Mail address, therefore asking the
jury to infer that use of a Proton Mail——and I didn't bring up
Proton Mail questions, I'm almost a hundred percent sure it
came out on this direct somehow——that the jury should infer
that that was a sign of a nefarious transaction. I am not
seeking to introduce what Bill Gertz said because, frankly, the
only thing the man did say is, let's use Proton Mail, which is
the only fact I wanted to bring out and show that one of the
board of directors, who is outside of any influence of Miles
Guo, used Proton Mail. That's the most basic fact I was
seeking to elicit. And again, the email exchanges are all——
THE COURT: I want to go back to your question about
whether she received an email from this individual in which he



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
said X. My recollection is that I sustained the objection, and
so that it is not in.
MR. HORTON: I think there was——I may be remembering
this incorrectly. I thought there was a question unrelated to
the email about whether she knew if somebody had used Proton
Mail; just the simple knowledge of whether she knew person X
used Proton Mail. I thought that had come in. I think the
point is not——just to be clear——that the Proton Mail is not
relevant; it's that this is hearsay and it's about Bill Gertz's
purposes.
THE COURT: Yes. I'm excluding his statements. But
also, I think that you're implying that the mere use of Proton
Mail implies something.
MS. SHROFF: No. They implied that to another
witness. I was cleaning it up.
THE COURT: No, they did not. They merely stated that
the dealership received an email from Proton Mail, an
individual using Proton Mail. They did not discuss any of the
qualities of Proton Mail.
MS. SHROFF: Oh, they did not. They just wanted the
jury to infer that something's wrong with using Proton Mail,
which is why with that witness, I had to clarify that he gets a
lot of emails from Proton Mail. But you know what, I'll move
on, your Honor.
THE COURT: Good.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
MS. SHROFF: I do want to note that these emails are
maintained in the regular course of business and they do fall
under the business exception rule to the hearsay.
THE COURT: But you're not allowed to get in hearsay
statements merely because they're inside of a business
document.
MS. SHROFF: That's true, your Honor, but I thought it
was relevant, and it's not hearsay. We've been arguing about
hearsay throughout, and I just wanted to make sure the
government is clear on defense's position that there are other
exceptions to the hearsay rule. But I shall move on. It's not
worth it.
MR. HORTON: If I can briefly respond to the last
thing Ms. Shroff said. If she intends to lay a foundation to
get business records in, she can try to do that. I don't think
that's been done yet. Ms. Maistrello is not a document
custodian. There's some work to be done I think if that's
coming next.
MS. SHROFF: I don't think I need a document custodian
to get a hearsay business record in, but thank you for the
lecture.
THE COURT: Ms. Shroff?
MS. SHROFF: Yes, your Honor. Your Honor——
THE COURT: The way that you were just speaking was
huffy, and I ask you to please not do that.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
MS. SHROFF: I was huffy, your Honor, but I'm tired,
and I don't think this is a valid objection. The government
knows it falls clearly within the business record rule, and the
government is doing as much as it can to prolong this
testimony. There's no reason for any of this. There really
isn't. The government has done this with every objection here.
They inject other issues that are really not relevant to the
analysis. This is a simple issue. This is——
THE COURT: So I don't agree with your claiming that
this is an exception to the hearsay rule. So let us go back.
And please, please, I want you to be even-tempered.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you, your Honor.

O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
(In open court)
THE COURT: The objection was sustained.
BY MS. SHROFF:
Q. You were aware of the need to investigate the distributed
denial of services attack, correct?
A. Can you repeat the question, please.
Q. You were asked to investigate the distributed denial of
service attacks, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection. Asked and answered.
THE COURT: I'll allow the answer. Go ahead.
A. Yes.
THE COURT: And Ms. Shroff, you used a term there that
I don't understand. Distributed what?
MS. SHROFF: Distributed denial of service attacks.
THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.
Q. And that's when a platform is cyber-attacked, correct?
A. In my understanding, yes.
Q. And you worked on that issue with a gentleman named Raj
Dhangra, D-H-A-N-G-R-A, correct?
A. Initially, I was alone. He was not hired yet.
Q. Your testimony is that he was not hired when you were
assigned this task?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And that came up when he was hired, correct,
according to you?



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
A. Can you repeat the question.
Q. Sure. There came a time when he was in fact hired,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And he had a technology background that you did not
have, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And he was employed as a person in the IT department,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And he assisted with all IT-related issues, correct? That
was his job, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And he's the one who assisted you in investigating that
matter, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you emailed with him while he worked there, correct?
A. I mainly——we mainly spoke. We shared the same office.
Q. All right. Well, let me see if I can refresh your
recollection about emailing with him, okay?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor. There was no
failure of recollection.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Do you recall emailing him about this specific task at
hand?



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
A. I don't remember.
MS. SHROFF: May I approach, your Honor?
THE COURT: You may.
Q. Is it fair to say, ma'am, that you interacted with him on
issues involving the security of cyber systems?
A. We spoke about it.
Q. Okay. And you also spoke to him about the issues of
entrance and security for people entering the building,
correct?
A. I sent an email to him as I did to other employees.
Q. And you emailed about what topic, ma'am?
A. Are you referring to the email I have in my hand right now?
Q. I don't need to. I just was testing your recollection of
the topics you covered with him. You emailed him about
security in the building, correct?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Well, may I ask that you read that document and see if it
refreshes your recollection.
A. I see the document, and I see that I——
THE COURT: Well, don't say what the document says.
The only question is, does it refresh your recollection.
That's a yes or no question.
THE WITNESS: Oh.
A. It doesn't refresh my recollection, but I——I see what's
written in the email.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
Q. Okay. And you were aware that there was a security issue
at the building in which Golden Spring was located, correct?
A. We had——we were told that we had to keep the building
secure.
Q. And you wanted to make sure only authorized people came to
the Golden Spring New York office, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. You put in place verification procedures, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You put in place the process whereby each vendor's name
would have to be on a list before they could enter the
building, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. You put in place a process so that the vendor's name would
have to be told, the date of the visit would have to be told,
the time of the visit would have to be told, and the reason for
the visit would have to be told, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You put in place the requirement that each vendor have
identification presented before they were allowed into the
building to come to the Golden Spring New York office, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you were the person who made yourself responsible for
making sure that the security team and any other party that was
involved was aware of this procedure, correct?



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
A. Yes.
Q. And you were the one who informed the entire team that you
would keep a record of each of these procedures being followed,
correct?
MR. HORTON: Your Honor, the document is not in
evidence.
MS. SHROFF: I'm not asking about the document, your
Honor, most respectfully.
THE COURT: So first, the witness must answer "I don't
recall" before considering a document that may or may not
refresh her recollection. So the procedure is, you're asked a
question; if you say that you don't recall, then she says, is
there something that might refresh your recollection; it is at
that time that you might refer to the document.
Go ahead.
BY MS. SHROFF:
Q. Would you like me to repeat the question, ma'am?
A. Yes, please.
Q. Sure. And do you remember that in the year 2018, while you
were working at Golden Spring, you took on the responsibility
of forwarding this protocol to the security team to make sure
that everyone was aware of the protocol itself?
A. I don't remember doing that.
Q. May I ask if the document that I have handed to you, and if
you look——refreshes your recollection.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
A. Yes.
Q. Do you now remember that you said you would remain
responsible for forwarding that message of the protocol to the
security team, correct?
A. As I read it on the document, yes.
Q. Okay. And you——
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: So you can't say what the document says.
You can only say if the document refreshes your recollection.
Does it help you to remember what she is asking about? That's
the question. Does the document refresh your recollection?
THE WITNESS: It does not.
BY MS. SHROFF:
Q. It does not refresh your recollection of what you did in
2018, correct?
A. It does not.
Q. In fact, there are a lot of things you've forgotten about
2018 now, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You've forgotten your interactions with the security team,
correct?
A. I forgot certain things, yes.
Q. And you also forgot your involvement with the security team
vis-à-vis the cyber attack issues, correct?
I'll rephrase that. You've forgotten how you



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
interacted with the security teams regarding the entering and
leaving of visitors to the Golden Spring's office, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: So that is a compound question.
MS. SHROFF: You know what, your Honor, I'll move on.
Thank you.
Q. Now on direct, you testified, did you not, about something
called Rule of Law, right? Those were the questions asked of
you yesterday. Do you remember that?
A. I do.
Q. Okay. There's no such thing as Rule of Law, correct?
A. I don't understand the question.
Q. Sure. I'll be happy to try again. There is Rule of Law
Society, correct?
A. There is.
Q. Right. And there is Rule of Law Foundation, correct?
A. There is, correct.
Q. There was no entity simply called Rule of Law, correct?
A. No. We referred to both entities as Rule of Law
collectively.
Q. You referred to that?
MR. HORTON: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled.
A. We did.
THE COURT: Was that a question?



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
MS. SHROFF: I'm sorry?
THE COURT: You've asked a question. You referred to
them; is that the question?
MS. SHROFF: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. We did.
Q. Well, let's try that. There was a board for the Rule of
Law Society, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You were on that board, right?
A. I was.
Q. There was a Rule of Law Foundation board, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You were not on that board, correct?
A. I was not.
Q. Right. So if somebody asked you if you were on the board
of Rule of Law, you would have to say, I'm on the board of Rule
of Law Society, I am not on the board of Rule of Law
Foundation, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Because that would be a truthful answer, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And it would be complete, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Now the board of Rule of Law Society, in 2018,



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
consisted of Steve Bannon, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Sasha Gong, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Bill Gertz, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And Jennifer Mercurio, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you, right?
A. Right.
Q. Okay. And it was not Miles Guo who gave you any position
on that board; it was the board that voted to get you that
position, correct?
A. He chose me.
Q. Let's try that. Who told you he chose you?
A. He did.
Q. He told you that he chose you to be on the board; that's
your testimony?
A. It is.
Q. Okay. Did he make an announcement: Welcome to the board
of directors Rule of Law Society, I have appointed you to be on
the board?
A. I don't remember a public announcement.
Q. Okay. Did he send an email?
A. No.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
Q. Did he put it on Twitter?
A. He did not.
Q. Did he put it on YouTube?
A. I don't know.
Q. He's a man, according to you, who likes publicity, right?
A. What do you mean about——with publicity?
Q. Okay. According to you, he's the type of man who likes to
be the center of attention, right?
A. He is.
Q. He is. So no grand announcement about him making you a
member of the board? No, right?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Okay. Each one of you five people had one vote, correct?
A. In general, you mean?
Q. No. I mean as when you were on the board of the Rule of
Law Society.
A. Oh. Yes.
Q. Okay. I don't mean——that's what I meant. For the Rule of
Law Society, you had one vote, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And there were five of you, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. What did it take to be a majority?
A. I don't remember.
Q. You don't remember what it took to be a majority for a



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
board that you sat on for less than two years?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. You voted against certain requests, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You voted no, correct?
A. Once, yes.
Q. You were never fired from the board, right?
A. I was not.
Q. You were not. You remained on the board until you decided
to quit for medical reasons, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Mr. Guo never called you into his office and said, hey, why
did you vote that way, correct?
A. Not that I remember.
Q. Okay. I just want to make sure. You'd remember something
like that, right?
A. I don't know if I would remember.
Q. You wouldn't remember being fired from a board?
A. I would remember being fired from a board; that, yes.
Q. You'd remember him chastising you, correct, because,
according to you, he was Boss, right?
A. Can you repeat the question.
Q. Sure. You would remember being chastised by him because,
according to you, he was Boss, right?
A. I would remember.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
Q. And he never chastised you for the way you voted, right?
A. No.
Q. Okay. You testified about a home that he bought in
Connecticut; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. And that home was bought in February or March of 2020; is
that correct?
A. I don't remember the exact date.
Q. It was bought after you started working there, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And before you quit, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. When did you quit?
A. In April of 2020.
Q. April of what?
A. 2020.
Q. And we know from yesterday that your first day on the job
was February 19th, correct?
A. My first day on the job was February 19 of 2018.
Q. What? 2019, right? 2018.
A. 2018.
Q. Right. So that house had to be bought somewhere between
2018 and 2020, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And did you visit the house?



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
A. Once.
Q. You visited the house once?
A. Yes.
Q. It's huge, right?
A. It's not small.
Q. And there were people in and out of that house doing
broadcasting, correct?
A. When I was there, I didn't see anyone.
Q. When you were there, did you see the office that he had in
the house?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Do you remember seeing equipment in the house?
A. I——no.
Q. Do you remember seeing cameras in the house?
A. No.
Q. Do you remember seeing camera lighting in the house?
A. No.
Q. Do you remember seeing background screens in the house?
A. No.
Q. Sitting here today, do you know who paid for all of that
equipment that was in his house?
MR. HORTON: Objection.
Q. Did you know——
MS. SHROFF: I apologize, your Honor. I'll withdraw.
Q. Did you know if there was——even if you didn't see it, you



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
knew there was equipment in his house in Connecticut, correct?
A. Can you repeat the question.
Q. Sure. You testified right now on cross-examination that
you never saw this equipment at his Connecticut home, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Did you know that he had equipment in his Connecticut home?
A. I don't know.
Q. Okay. Did you know if he had broadcast equipment at the
Sherry-Netherland?
A. Yes.
Q. He did have it, correct?
A. He did.
Q. And he had the same equipment that I recited two minutes
ago, correct?
A. Such as?
Q. I can repeat it if you need me to.
A. Yes, please.
Q. Okay. He had cameras, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Background screens, correct?
A. That I don't remember.
Q. Lighting, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Recording equipment, correct?
A. Yes.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
Q. Broadcasting equipment, correct, most particularly this
one?
A. Yes.
Q. All of that was paid for by Golden Spring New York,
correct?
A. No.
Q. It wasn't paid for by Golden Spring, New York?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Asked and answered.
Q. Who paid for it, according to you?
A. Saraca.
Q. And who's Saraca?
A. Saraca was a company that paid for media and tech expenses.
Q. And Saraca was the holding company for Golden Springs New
York, right?
A. Can you repeat the question.
Q. Saraca was the holding company for Golden Spring New York,
correct?
A. I don't know about that.
Q. You don't know William Je managed Saraca?
A. I don't.
Q. You don't know if Saraca had family fund money?
A. I don't.
Q. So you don't know anything about Saraca, but you're sure
Saraca paid the bill.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Compound question.
Q. Do you know anything about Saraca?
A. What I just told you.
Q. Okay. Where did the money into Saraca come from?
A. I don't know.
Q. Okay. You testified about an office at 800 Fifth Avenue,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And is it fair to say that that was really an apartment
building, like a makeshift office that was put in place?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. It was a three-bedroom apartment, right?
A. It was a two-bedroom apartment.
Q. Okay. And people were using it as an office, right?
A. We were, yes.
Q. Right. And there came a time when it was just too crammed
and everybody agreed to move, correct?
A. We moved in 2019.
Q. Okay. And you moved to the East 64th building, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And Golden Spring relocated there, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. And the holding company named Saraca also relocated there,
correct?



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
A. I don't know what the official location of Saraca was.
Q. Okay. So you don't know if Saraca relocated to 64th
Street; do I have it right?
THE COURT: Asked and answered.
Q. And you continued to work for Golden Spring at East 64th
Street, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you testified on direct you worked long hours, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Was it Golden Spring's practice to have free lunch for
every one of its employees every day of the week?
A. At 800 Fifth, yes.
Q. Okay. That practice continued at 64th, correct?
A. No.
Q. Okay. When you worked long hours, you were given a hotel
room to sleep in the city, correct?
A. When I was working consecutive days, yes.
Q. Okay. They put you up in a hotel, didn't make you drive
back and forth from work, right?
A. I——I could choose.
Q. You could choose, right? And you chose, right?
A. I did.
Q. Okay. Now you testified on direct about how bills were
paid, right?
I'll move on.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
A. How vendors were paid.
Q. I'm sorry?
A. How vendors were paid.
Q. Okay. Fair enough. And do I have it right, the vendor
would need paying and you would go to Yvette, correct?
A. It depended on the amount.
Q. So if it was above a certain amount, you would go to
Yvette; is that right?
A. That's right.
Q. Okay. And you referred to Yvette as Yanping Wang; is that
right?
A. When I——when I talked about her to my colleagues, then I
would call her Yvette; when I talked to her, I would use her
Chinese name.
Q. Okay. And it was Yvette who decided whether to pay the
vendor or not, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. There were times when you had to get preauthorization from
Yvette before you would undertake an expense from a particular
vendor, correct?
A. Yes.
MS. SHROFF: Okay. Could I just have the witness and
the jury see SM62, please.
Q. You recall testifying about this document on direct?
A. I remember.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
Q. Okay. And this document is you seeking someone to sign off
on payment to a particular vendor; is that correct?
A. It's a payment request form.
Q. Right. So if I could just highlight for you the name of
the payee, that would be Apple Inc., correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And Apple is at 767 Fifth Avenue, which is right next to
the Sherry-Netherland, right, the FAO Schwarz building,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. If you could scroll down to the payment amount, it's
$1,217.17. Well, up top it says 17 cents, but here it says 95
cents, correct?
A. 1,117.95.
Q. Small amount, right, relatively?
A. What do you mean by small?
Q. It's a small amount of money. It's $1,117 for three pieces
of equipment from Apple, correct?
A. That's the correct amount, yes.
Q. Okay. You did not have authority to sanction payment on
$1,117, right?
A. Can you repeat the question, please.
Q. Sure. You did not have the authority to allow payment on
$1,117.95, correct?
A. Not with Saraca.



O5V1GUO1 Maistrello - Cross
Q. You had no authority to sanction payment, correct?
A. Not with Saraca.
Q. Your testimony today is, if this bill were going to Golden
Spring, you could have paid the bill?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor. Asked and
answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Let's see the top of this document, okay?
You see that's where it says Golden Spring New York
Ltd.?
A. I do.
Q. Okay. And let's go to the bottom of that document.
Requested by you, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. When you filled out the form——go back up, please——you
filled out the requisition to Golden Spring, correct?
A. No. It was crossed out.

O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross

MS. SHROFF: I could not hear her answer. I
apologize, your Honor.

right?
A. Yes.

A. Yes.
Q. And on direct you testified that it was Mr. Guo who



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
introduced you to Mr. Je; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Isn't it true that Mr. Guo had nothing to do with that
introduction; in fact, it was Yvette Wang who introduced you to
Mr. Je?
A. No, I'm pretty sure boss introduced me to William.

case?
A. Yes.

Do you recall that testimony you gave?

MS. SHROFF: Could you just go one page back.

A. I do.
Q. Does that refresh the testimony you gave under oath at a
deposition?



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
A. Yes.
Q. And under oath at a deposition, you said: "I was
introduced to William by Mrs. Wang as a person of trust, and I
met him several times." Correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor. This is not
evidence. Not before the jury.
THE COURT: Overruled.
MR. HORTON: It is before the jury, and it's not in
evidence.
THE COURT: Oh, you're saying that this is being shown
to the jurors? This should not be shown to the jurors.
It is not? Do you have a document in front of you?
THE JURY: It was.

A. And other people, yes.

all; correct?
A. He was not.
Q. Okay. And it was William Je who asked you to join the

that right?
A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And you sat on that board of ACA until you received

A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And Ms. Wang was not present for that conversation;
correct?
A. She was not.
Q. Okay. And you were free to tell him whatever was on your
mind about that subpoena, right?
A. Yes.

Q. Ms. Wang was not seated next to you during the deposition,
right?
MR. HORTON: Objection. Same objection.
We've been through this.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, may I approach?
THE COURT: Yes.
(Continued on next page)



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
(At sidebar)
THE COURT: So my recollection is that you asked
yesterday whether Ms. Wang was there at the deposition.
MS. SHROFF: Right. But I don't think I ever covered
that there was a lawyer and Ms. Wang was three seats away. I
never covered the scope of what she testified to during the
deposition. I never questioned her on all the acts that
happened after the deposition was over. I never covered any
part of the discussion about the deposition with Miles Guo
about all of this.
I don't think I covered any of that. And I'm pretty
certain I checked last night; but if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but
I don't think I covered that.
I think I'm entitled to show that Ms. Wang was not
seated next to her as they implied; that there was a lawyer
seated next to her; Ms. Wang was three seats down. I think I'm
allowed to show all of that.
MR. HORTON: Your Honor, this line of questioning,
which is not just the last several questions, but I think it's
about ten minutes of questions, is needlessly cumulative. It's
going to significantly prolong the trial, particularly if it's
a pace that's continued with the witnesses who are to come.
And we've gone over it again and again and again, and your
Honor has sustained a number of the same kind of objection,
which is that the question is asked and answered, and it's



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
followed again by the same questions and the same topic.
THE COURT: So the questioning has been repetitive.
You found every way to ask whether an individual gave sworn
testimony at a deposition, and so it is needless. So if you
would just stick to what is necessary to be more efficient in
the questioning.
MS. SHROFF: I'd be happy to try, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.
MR. HORTON: Can we ask how much is left of her
cross-examination?
MS. SHROFF: I have no idea. I don't know. I think
30 minutes.
THE COURT: Then take a moment to think about it.
MS. SHROFF: Thirty minutes.
THE COURT: Thirty minutes.
MS. SHROFF: But I'm telling you honestly, I have a
lot of trouble hearing her. It's also adding to my degree of
frustration, but I simply cannot hear her. And I feel
ridiculous asking, I can't hear you, like ten times. I
apologize, your Honor, but I'm having a lot of trouble hearing
her.
THE COURT: Do you need a hearing aid?
MS. SHROFF: I can't have a hearing aid. My deafness
was due to some kind of weird injury. I was seen at Mt. Sinai
Hospital in Brooklyn. They gave me prednisone injections to



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
try and recover it. I can't do anything about it. I normally
don't have this struggle. So I apologize, your Honor, I really
do, but I don't --
THE COURT: Do you need a device to amplify what
you're hearing in the ear that works?
MS. SHROFF: I'm only having trouble with this
witness. I haven't had trouble with the other two before. I
will try better, your Honor.
But I really am having trouble hearing her. And I
don't want to keep asking you to repeat. So you see when I'm
craning forward, I'm really trying to see if I can hear better.
So I apologize about that. I am having trouble hearing.
THE COURT: Are you making a request that I --
MS. SHROFF: No, no, no, I'm not --
THE COURT: -- install any additional equipment or
give you an opportunity to have a medical exam or somehow
address the deafness?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor, not at all. I'm not
seeking to make a record of any kind. I do not plan to raise
this at any appeal. I'm just telling you why I'm having
trouble hearing her, that's all. It is nothing that I
intend -- I'm not laying the foundation for anything down the
road at all. I'm just trying to explain what's going on,
that's all.
THE COURT: I am going to ask her again to speak up.



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
MS. SHROFF: Okay. I just want to be very clear, your
Honor, I'm really not trying to lay a foundation about
anything. I hope that's very clear.
MR. HORTON: Your Honor, we just want to note that
cross has been longer than the direct.
And your Honor is interested in the July 4th target
that was set up in the case, and we have concerns about being
able to hit that at the pace this is going.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, we join in that concern.
And we also ask the government that if they could stop
looping, that would also make the trial shorter.
THE COURT: Actually, looping is a more efficient way
actually.
MS. SHROFF: I don't think so. I think it's leading
and I think it's very prejudicial to the defense.
And, you know, defense lawyers have long argued
against looping, your Honor.
THE COURT: So there is a long way and a short way to
do a direct examination. If we take the long way, it prolongs
the trial.
MS. SHROFF: I apologize, your Honor. I always
thought just saying what happened next is shorter than, you
know, When you went to the house and then saw the blue flag,
then tell me what happened next. So I apologize. I will do
better. I will try to move it right along.

event; correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection.

microphone? And would you speak up, please.

O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
A. I never transferred it in the first place.
Q. Right. And when others transferred it, sitting here today,
you have no evidence that they ever transferred it back;
correct?

to transfer any money out of Saraca; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. You had no authority to pay any bills with the Saraca
account; correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor. We covered this.
THE COURT: Sustained. You've gone over this.
Q. The first meeting of the board for Rule of Law Society was
in May of 2019, do you remember that?
A. I don't.
Q. You don't remember the very first meeting in May of 2019?

O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
A. Can you repeat the question, please.
Q. Sure. Do you remember a special meeting being convened to
discuss Ms. Gong getting fired by Voice of America for doing an
interview with Mr. Guo? Do you recall that?
A. I don't remember a special meeting. I remember her sharing
this fact.
Q. And you don't remember the board voting on her request to
get assistance to sue Voice of America for wrongful firing?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Okay. Do you remember August 23rd, 2019, announcement
about a September 3rd, 2019, board meeting? Do you recall
that?
A. I do not.
Q. Do you recall that there was an actual board meeting on
September 3rd of 2019?
A. I don't.
Q. Do you remember that one of the agendas was to review the
budget? Does that help you refresh your recollection?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: I think that you've already gone over this
territory, Ms. Shroff.
Q. Do you recall the Rule of Law Society having a proposal —
and you testified to this yesterday — to ship PPE to China;
correct?
A. Yes.



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
Q. And you testified that made no sense to you, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you testified that it didn't make any sense to you that
PPE was being sent back to China because China was the one who
was making the N95 masks; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. But the N95 masks are just one part of PPE; correct?
A. I don't understand the question.
Q. There are different kinds of masks, right, during COVID?
A. In general?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And when you thought that, you had no knowledge
whether the ordinary person in China had access to an N95 mask;
correct?
A. I don't remember.
Q. And you had no knowledge if the family members of people
who were in the United States wanted masks sent to their family
members in China; correct?
A. What people?
Q. Dissidents, people who were supporters of Rule of Law
Society.
THE COURT: She can't testify as to what was on the
mind of other people.
Q. You were aware, were you not, that Rule of Law Society was



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
supporting dissidents; correct?
A. That was the mission.
Q. And dissidents had family in China; correct?
A. Some may have.
Q. And dissidents in the United States would want their family
members in China to have --
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

was not on a yacht, but at his home in Connecticut?
MR. HORTON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Can you repeat the question, please.
Q. Your testimony is that it is your recollection that in
March of 2020, Mr. Guo, during the pandemic, was at his home in
Connecticut and not on a yacht?



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross

A. No.
Q. During the pandemic, you did not go to the office; correct?

Q. I'm only asking about you, ma'am. My question to you was
were you going to the office?
A. I stopped going to the office on March 16.
Q. Okay. And, in fact, Yvette went to the office during the
pandemic every single day; correct?



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
A. I don't know. I wasn't there.
Q. Okay. So when you said "we stopped going," you really
meant you stopped going; correct?

right? You don't know if Dan Podhaskie stopped going; correct?

about that -- I mean talking to them about that topic?

at the office, were working from home, and you had no idea what
was being moved; correct?
A. Can you repeat the question, please?

not know what was being moved, but that is what you had heard;
correct?

O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
Connecticut; correct? You weren't there, right?
A. I wasn't there physically, no.

repeating what somebody else had told you; correct?
A. That's not correct.
Q. Okay. Well, did you tell the FBI that you were not at the
office and you did not see these moves?
A. I did not see the moves with my eyes as I was not there.
Q. Okay. So you have no personal knowledge. You only know
what somebody told you.

Nobody drafted a letter for you to sign from Mr. Guo
to the NYPD; correct?
A. No.

A. I was asked to draft it.



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross

correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And you, in fact, never drafted such a letter;
correct?
A. I did not.
Q. Okay. Mr. Guo didn't say, If my name is not on the letter,
don't send the PPE to the NYPD, right?
A. He never said that.
Q. Right.
And NYPD got the PPE, right?
A. I believe they did.
Q. Right.
You sent it, right?
A. I did not.
Q. Exactly. Somebody else sent it because you weren't
physically there, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. Now, you testified a great deal about the security
and how you thought it was nonsensical; correct?
A. I testified that it was not needed.
Q. Okay. And when you decided it was not needed, were you
aware that Mr. Guo was visited by ministers from China and
agents of the CCP, were you aware of that?
A. I was aware of a visit in 2017.



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
Q. You were aware of a visit in 2017; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you were aware that he was visited by agents of the
CCP's ministry of state security; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And they visited him at his home; correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And at that time his wife and daughter were still in China;
correct?
A. I don't know.
Q. And at that time, you were aware, were you not, that he was
the main target of CCP's Fox Hunt campaign; correct?
A. I was not working for him at that time yet.
Q. My question was were you aware?
MR. HORTON: Objection. Asked and answered.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. I was not aware.
Q. Were you aware that there was a campaign to coerce Mr. Guo
to return to China?
A. Are you referring to a specific period, a specific year
and --
Q. Were you ever aware of that fact?
A. I was told.
Q. What year was that?
A. 2018.



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross

A. Yes.
Q. And that is when he had security; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You were aware, were you not, that when he was visited by
the CCP ministries, he was threatened?
MR. HORTON: Objection.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. I don't remember being told that.

kidnapped?
MR. HORTON: Objection. This is hearsay, your Honor.
THE COURT: Please step up.
(Continued on next page)



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
(At sidebar)
THE COURT: So I thought the lengthy stipulation
covered this.
MR. HORTON: Yes, your Honor. It's clearly being
elicited to repeat that truth.
The first problem with that I think is that the
witness has established that she doesn't have personal
knowledge of this. So the questions are all, Were you told X
about Y, the goal of getting in the truth of X and Y.
THE COURT: So she at some point learns that he was
being targeted by the CCP, she said that.
MR. HORTON: Right. She said that she was told
certain things. And it seems that they are trying to get the
truth of those things in right here, and doing that by asking,
And what did this other person who's not here tell you, what
was that statement, to say that that statement is true.
THE COURT: So you're objecting on a hearsay ground.
MR. HORTON: I agree it's cumulative with the
stipulation, as your Honor said. But it's also --
THE COURT: No, I didn't say that.
MR. HORTON: Sorry. I wasn't trying to be cute. I
must have misheard you.
THE COURT: No, no, no. That long statement is
something that I'm sure the jury has not completely
assimilated.



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
MR. HORTON: Fair enough. I really didn't mean to
suggest anything.
It is eliciting hearsay for the truth of that hearsay.
They are asking, And who did this person — who's not identified
— tell you and what did they say and what were those
statements.
MS. SHROFF: I really do not care at all if it's true
or not. All I want to show is she knew all of this and then
decided that the only reason he had security is because it
sounded better to call them security than to call them
handymen. That is my only point here.
MR. HORTON: So there's testimony in the record
sufficient to allow Ms. Shroff to make a point that she just
said she wants to make. The point of this barrage in these
questions is for the truth of the statements.
THE COURT: Well, you took pands to try to make it
appear that there wasn't a legitimate authentic security
apparatus in place. And so now she's trying to establish that
there was.
MR. HORTON: It is still hearsay. And if she goes and
does the next thing, correct, like we may or may not object to
the way that comes in; but right now we're on this series of
hearsay statements that are coming in for their truth.
MS. SHROFF: It's really not -- go ahead.
MR. KAMARAJU: I was just going to say, the witness



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
testified she thought the security was bogus. We're allowed to
elicit that she was told all these facts; that this undercuts
her testimony the security is bogus. That's it.
THE COURT: It is a form of impeachment, so I'm going
to permit it.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
(Continued on next page)



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
(In open court)
THE COURT: Go ahead.

amongst yourselves. Don't permit anyone to discuss it in your
presence.
(Jury not present)
THE COURT: You may step down. And don't discuss your
testimony.
(Witness not present)
THE COURT: You may be seated.



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
Is there anything that either party would like to
raise before we break?
MR. FINKEL: Just very briefly, your Honor.
Just for the record, Ms. Maistrello's direct
examination was approximately an hour and 40 minutes, give or
take. The cross-examination has been about three hours and 15
minutes, give or take.
Obviously we've been objecting, and your Honor has
largely sustained sort of questions that just repeat the
answers with some exasperation or "oh, really," which are kind
of argumentative and are delaying the proceedings. We'll
continue to object to those of course.
Just generally, your Honor, the government's estimate
with respect to this trial was based on what we understood to
be reasonable crosses. I think generally the rule of thumb is
about -- it depends on the witness, obviously, but if direct is
an hour, usually cross is around half an hour, sometimes more
sometimes less, sometimes witnesses require a one-to-one. But
from one hour and 42 minutes to three hours and 20 minutes,
it's a lot and I think it's a lot of repeating. So we just
want to make our record on that.
THE COURT: I'm waiting for a response.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, I apologize, but I don't
think Mr. Finkel's comments were inviting a response and I
don't have one.



O5UVGUO2 Maistrello - Cross
The cross was the cross. And, you know, Mr. Finkel,
if he thinks my cross was bad, can certainly bring it up at the
2255 proceeding. But I will do my best and I did do my best to
do the cross I wanted to do.
THE COURT: So the only criticism that I heard was
that it was too lengthy because there were repetitive
questions. And there were repetitive questions. And so I'd
like you to eliminate repetitive questions.
MS. SHROFF: I will do my best, your Honor.
THE COURT: All righty. We'll break.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MR. HORTON:
Q. Good afternoon, Ms. Maistrello.
A. Good afternoon.
Q. At the end of cross-examination, you were asked some
questions about past work you've done for the FBI, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Did you do any work for the FBI on this case?
A. No.
Q. Did you do any work for anybody on this case?
A. No.
Q. At a high level, could you describe the past work you've
done for the FBI.
A. It was mainly interpretation, transcription, and
translation.
Q. You were also asked questions about meeting with the
government. Do you remember that?
A. Yes.
Q. Did the government tell you what to say in your testimony,
Ms. Maistrello?



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Redirect
A. No.
Q. What, if anything, did the government tell you to do when
you testified?
A. The only thing I was told is to be truthful.
Q. And have you done that?
A. I have.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, you testified yesterday that Yvette Wang
asked you in your job interview whether you had any connections
to the CCP. Do you remember that?
A. I do.
THE COURT: Mr. Horton, if you would please bring the
microphone up closer to you.
MR. HORTON: Yes, your Honor.
Q. After Yvette asked you if you had any connections to the
CCP, what was her response when you told her that you knew CCP
members when you were in China?
A. She said, oh, don't worry, I'm a party member too.
Q. And what did you understand Yvette to mean when she said
she was a party member?
A. I understood that she was a member of the party.
Q. And what, if anything, did Miles Guo say about Yvette being
a member of the CCP?
A. We didn't talk about that much, but sometimes he would joke
about it.
Q. And how would he joke about it?



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Redirect
A. Well, considering the fact that he was fighting against the
CCP, miles would bring up the joke and say, oh, you know,
Yvette, she's also a party member.
Q. You were asked questions today about whether you remembered
being chastised by Miles Guo. Do you remember those questions?
A. I do.
Q. When, if ever, Ms. Maistrello, did Miles Guo chastise you?
A. I don't remember.
Q. And when, if ever, did Miles Guo chastise your colleagues?
MS. SHROFF: Objection as to which colleagues.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. I——I don't remember.
Q. Generally speaking, how did Miles Guo treat the people who
worked for him?
A. It highly depended on his mood, so when he was in a good
mood, he treated people kindly, when he was in a bad mood, then
less kindly.
Q. And what kinds of things would make him in a bad mood?
A. Things that were not being done like he wanted to.
Q. And what would happen when things weren't being done the
way Miles Guo wanted them to be done?
A. When things were done properly, then he was——he was happy.
Q. And what would happen when he was unhappy?
A. He would——he would usually yell.
Q. What kind of things would he say when he yelled?



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Redirect
A. That we're stupid, we don't know, we're incompetent.
Q. And how often did that happen?
A. Quite often.
Q. How often, if ever, were people fired by Miles Guo?
A. Very often.
Q. And for what kinds of reasons?
A. Various reasons. Sometimes he didn't like them, sometimes
he didn't like what they looked like or what they were wearing,
what they were doing.
Q. You testified, Ms. Maistrello, that you were involved with
Miles Guo's move to Connecticut in 2020. Do you recall that?
A. I recall that.
Q. And you also testified that there were times you were told
to pay for things when you worked for Miles Guo; is that right?
MS. SHROFF: Objection. She was told. That's not the
testimony.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Yes.
Q. When, if ever, Ms. Maistrello, were you directed not to pay
for something?
A. It happened several times. Yvette would tell me, we're not
satisfied with this, don't pay this vendor.
Q. How much did that move that you were involved in planning
to Miles Guo's home in Connecticut, how much did it cost?
A. Approximately 100,000.



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Redirect
Q. And what, if anything, were you told to do with that
$100,000 bill for the movers?
A. Initially I was——I was told not to pay it, then I was——I
was told to ask for discount.
Q. And why were you told not to pay the $100,000 bill?
MS. SHROFF: I have a hearsay objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. What was your reaction when you were told not to pay the
bill?
MS. SHROFF: Objection as to relevance.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. I wanted to understand the reasons why I was asked that.
Q. Who told you not to pay that bill?
A. Yvette did.
Q. And what was the reason Yvette gave you for not paying the
hundred-thousand-dollar bill?
MS. SHROFF: Objection to the hearsay.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. I was told that they did not a good job——they did not do a
good job, that some items were damaged during the move.
Q. And how did you react to being told to not pay that bill?
A. I knew that nothing was damaged because we had a team on
site supervising the movers, so I didn't really understand why
I was asked to——to do that.
Q. You testified that there were other times you were told not



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
to pay for things?
A. Yes.
Q. What was the reason, as you understood it, you were told
not to pay for things?
A. Reasons varied. In general, I was told that we're not
satisfied with this vendor.
MR. HORTON: May I have one moment, your Honor.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. HORTON: Thank you, your Honor.
Q. Ms. Maistrello, you were asked questions on
cross-examination about whether you knew the source of the
funds for Saraca and Golden Spring. Do you remember that?
A. I do.
Q. What was the source of the funds that paid for N95 masks to
be sent to Miles Guo's home at the beginning of COVID?
A. That was Rule of Law organizations.
Q. And where did Rule of Law get its money from?
A. From donors.
MR. HORTON: Nothing further.
THE COURT: Recross, within the scope?
RECROSS EXAMINATION
BY MS. SHROFF:
Q. Tell us, would you, how does one become a member of the
Chinese Communist Party?
A. You are chosen by the party, so you're being contacted



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
directly by the party. It usually happens when you're in
college or university.
Q. Right. And it is the party that chooses the person to
become a member of the CCP, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. To become a member of the CCP, you have to be a Chinese
national, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. You have to be chosen by the CCP, and you're normally
chosen at a young age, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection to scope, your Honor.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. Correct.
Q. And Yvette was chosen as a young child——actually, not
child——as a teenager when she was then chosen to be a student
in a foreign country, correct?
A. I don't know at what age she was chosen.
Q. But you do know that she was chosen to be part of the CCP
and then allowed to study in the Sorbonne, in France, correct?
A. Those two things don't necessarily have a connection. I
know that she studied in France, and I know that she is a party
member.
Q. Right. And according to you, a person could not——actually,
I take that back.
There is no person that is able to say to the CCP, I



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
won't join your party, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection. Beyond the scope.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Isn't it fair to say that one would be at risk of harm if
one did not remain in the CCP party?
MR. HORTON: Same objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, may we approach?
THE COURT: Yes.
(Continued on next page)



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
(At the sidebar)
MS. SHROFF: They opened this door, your Honor, by
asking if Yvette is a member of the CCP. There is clear
testimony, and this expert——this person would know that once
you are made a party member of the CCP, there's no withdrawing
from the CCP. It's not a free organization where you say
bye-bye, I'm out. Yvette would have had no choice in remaining
a member of the CCP. I'm allowed to explore the misimpression
they have left that she had any connection to the CCP now,
meaning 2018, 2019, 2020, all throughout the indictment. They
decided to do this on recross. I am not being cumulative, I
hope, and it is——sorry.
THE COURT: Why are you bringing out her CCP
membership?
MR. HORTON: It completes the——it was a short
interview. It was a fact that was——that Yvette provided her in
this limited information exchange. That was one of the items.
And there was extensive cross examination about what
Ms. Maistrello did or didn't know about the organization.
MS. SHROFF: I specifically did not touch her being a
member of the CCP. It's all over the 3500 material. I did not
touch it. I did not touch it on cross. There was no reason
for them to bring it up on redirect. They have left this jury
with the impression that this woman now, and while being a
co-conspirator of Miles Guo, was with the CCP, because they



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
want to show that Miles Guo kept her employed and was close to
a member of the CCP party person and therefore, he could not be
anti-CCP, okay? They opened this door.
THE COURT: So then I'll let you ask a leading
question or two that gets us to the point where I would expect
her to say, no, you cannot be with the CCP.
MS. SHROFF: I should be able to explore that Yvette
said to her what Yvette's position is, she is no longer
supportive of the CCP, because that's the impression they want
to leave them with.
THE COURT: So then that makes two questions.
MS. SHROFF: Well, it's a little bit longer, your
Honor, because I have to flesh out that——what it takes to get
out of the CCP. Okay. So you can't just say no to the CCP.
Once you're chosen, you have to remain. There's no withdrawal
steps. If you wanted to disavow the CCP, there are no steps to
disavow the CCP.
THE COURT: Okay. That's one question.
MS. SHROFF: And that Yvette made very clear that she
was no longer now a member of the CCP.
THE COURT: Two questions.
MS. SHROFF: Well, that's three, but okay, I will try.
THE COURT: Good.
(Continued on next page)



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
(In open court)
MS. SHROFF: May I continue, your Honor.
THE COURT: You may.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you.
BY MS. SHROFF:
Q. Once you're chosen to be a member of the CCP, you are not
allowed to withdraw from the CCP, correct?
A. I don't know whether you're allowed to withdraw. I don't
know the law. I don't know how that works.
Q. When Ms. Wang worked with Mr. Guo, she worked for causes
that were anti-CCP, correct?
A. Not entirely.
Q. Ms. Wang took steps that were supportive of the CCP,
according to you?
A. Can you repeat the question, please.
Q. Sure. Is it your testimony that Yanping Wang took steps
that were supportive of the dictatorship of the Chinese
Communist Party?
A. No.
Q. Okay. So when she worked with Miles Guo, she worked on
causes that were anti-CCP, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection. Asked and answered.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. Not necessarily.
Q. Well, tell me, what do you mean by "not necessarily"?



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
A. The job that she was doing was not necessarily anti-CCP.
She was doing her job, but she was not always a political
activist.
Q. Right. She was not a political activist, but she was never
pro-CCP, correct?
A. She was never pro-CCP.
Q. Now you testified on redirect that you and your colleagues
were chastised by Mr. Guo, correct?
A. I said he could be tough.
Q. He yelled, you said, right?
A. He did.
Q. Called you stupid, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Called you incompetent, correct?
A. He did.
Q. He did that often, correct?
A. When he was mad.
Q. Right. And when he walked around, he would just simply
yell, "Disaster, disaster," wherever he went, right?
A. I did not say that.
Q. Okay. I didn't ask you if you said that. I asked you if
you knew if he did that.
A. He did that sometimes.
Q. Right. And when he did that, you were part and parcel of
the people that he was speaking toward, correct?



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
A. Sometimes I was, sometimes I wasn't.
Q. Okay. And as a result of that, is that what led you to
quit, or was it your health, or was it both?
A. I quit for health reasons.
Q. Okay. You testified about people he fired, right?
A. Yes.
Q. He never personally fired a single person, correct?
A. He gave directions to fire.
Q. You are aware of a single direction he gave to someone to
get another person fired? You have personal knowledge of that?
A. Yes.
Q. Really. Who?
A. You want to know who he asked to fire, who was fired?
What's your question?
Q. No, I'm asking you who you are aware he told to get fired.
I'm asking about your personal knowledge, not what you heard
from others.
A. He told me to fire some people.
Q. Did you fire them?
A. I did.
Q. You had the authority to fire people.
A. If Boss asked me to, yes.
Q. Okay. Who did you fire?
A. Several people.
Q. Who?



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
A. Do you want the names?
Q. Sure.
A. I don't remember the names. I remember the roles.
Q. You don't remember the names of people you fired from a
job?
A. I don't.
Q. Okay. You talked about the move to Connecticut costing a
hundred thousand dollars, correct?
A. Approximately.
Q. Right. You didn't pay that bill, right?
A. I did not.
Q. You had no authority ever to allow any payment, correct?
A. When I was asked to pay, I would pay.
Q. No. When you were asked to pay, you would go to Yvette,
correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection. Argumentative.
THE COURT: Would you clarify your question, please.
Q. When you were asked to pay a bill, you would have to send
the bill to either Max Krasner or Yvette, correct?
THE COURT: Are you referring to all bills?
MS. SHROFF: Yes, all bills.
A. It depended on the amount.
Q. Right. And an amount of a hundred thousand dollars, you
could not pay, correct?
A. That's correct.



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
Q. You testified that you were told not to pay a bill because
somebody was unhappy with a vendor, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And you do not know sitting here today who that
vendor was, right?
A. I do.
Q. Really? Who was the vendor?
MR. HORTON: Objection to the "really" in the
questions, your Honor.
THE COURT: Yes. If you'd leave out the "really."
Q. Who was the vendor?
A. The movers.
Q. What's the name?
A. Moving company. Broadway.
Q. Broadway Movers. Your testimony is Broadway Movers were
not paid; is that your testimony?
A. My testimony is that Broadway Movers were the movers.
Q. Okay. Were they paid?
A. Ultimately, I don't know.
Q. So you don't know if they were ultimately paid. So I'm
assuming you don't know how much it is that they were quibbling
about in terms of destruction of the property that was being
moved, correct?
MR. HORTON: Object to the form of that question, your
Honor.



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
THE COURT: Are you asking whether she knows what
discount amount was requested?
MS. SHROFF: Yes.
A. I don't remember.
Q. Wasn't your furniture, right?
A. Can you repeat the question, please.
Q. Sure. The furniture that was being moved was not your
furniture, right?
A. No.
Q. Well, you don't know if the furniture had sentimental
value, correct?
A. I know it did.
Q. So the furniture that was damaged had sentimental value and
that's why there was a conversation about not paying the
vendor; is that your testimony?
A. I know that no furniture was damaged.
Q. Did you inspect it?
A. Personally, I didn't.
Q. Did you see it?
A. I was not there.
Q. In fact, you don't even know what furniture they're talking
about, correct?
A. I do know that.
Q. What furniture was it?
A. I had a pdf document with hundreds of pages of furniture.



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
Q. And which of those hundreds of pages of furniture was
damaged; do you recall?
A. I do not.
Q. Okay. Fair to say you didn't examine a single piece of
furniture on that hundreds of pages of document, correct?
A. I was not present during the move.
Q. Right. And you just made a value judgment and decided the
vendors should have in fact paid, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection. Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. My colleagues who were present at the moves told me that
nothing was damaged.
Q. My question to you was——and let me repeat it——you made a
value judgment without ever inspecting the damaged furniture,
correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection. Asked and answered.
THE COURT: Sustained. Sustained.
Q. You testified that Rule of Law Society paid for the N95
masks, correct?
A. One of the Rule of Law organizations.
Q. Which one?
A. I don't remember.
Q. You don't remember at all which organization, correct?
MR. HORTON: Objection. Asked and answered.
THE COURT: All right. So ask the question only once.



O5V1GUO3 Maistrello - Recross
Don't repeat the question.
Q. You don't even remember how much the dollar amount was,
right?
A. I do not.
Q. You met with these prosecutors several times, correct?
A. I did.
Q. And not once did you look up that dollar amount, right?
A. No.
MS. SHROFF: I have nothing further.
THE COURT: All righty. I assume there's no
re-redirect?
MR. HORTON: Nothing further.
THE COURT: Good. Okay. So you may step out. Thank
you.
(Witness excused)
THE COURT: And the prosecution can call its next
witness.
MR. FERGENSON: The government calls Patrick Chin,
your Honor.
THE LAW CLERK: Please raise your right hand and bring

THE WITNESS: Okay.
THE COURT: You may inquire.
MR. FERGENSON: Thank you, your Honor.
PATRICK CHIN,
called as a witness by the Government,
having been duly sworn, testified as follows:
DIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MR. FERGENSON:
Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Chin.
A. Good afternoon.
Q. What state do you live in?
A. I live in Texas.
Q. What do you do for work?
A. I work on semiconductor material.
Q. What kind of work do you do with semiconductor material?
A. We make specialized semiconductor research for various
customers.
Q. Mr. Chin, do you know who Miles Guo is?



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
A. Yes, I do.
Q. How do you know who he is?
A. I ran into his——one of his YouTube videos, I think back in
2017.
Q. Were you ever a follower of Miles Guo?
A. Yes, I was.
Q. Did you ever invest in things Miles Guo promoted?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. Are you still a follower of Miles Guo today?
A. I am not.
Q. We'll come back to that, Mr. Chin.
Mr. Chin, where were you born?
A. I was born in Taiwan.
Q. And for how long did you live in Taiwan?
A. 24 years, between 1964 to 1988.
Q. And why was your family in Taiwan when you were growing up?
A. Both my parents' families originally were in mainland
China, and they moved to Taiwan after the Communist revolution.
Q. What was the Communist revolution, Mr. Chin?
A. I think after the second war, world war, there was a——a
civil war between Communist party, Chinese Communist Party and
the ruling government, and eventually the Communist party
pushed the previous Republic of China government to Taiwan.
Q. Mr. Chin, why did your parents' families leave mainland
China at the time of the rise of the Communist party, or the



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
CCP?
A. Yes. During the revolution, on my father's side, my
grandfather and several uncles were brutally murdered during
the Communism——Communist rise-up, so my father was able to
escape and eventually move to Taiwan.
And on my mother's side, that's a different part of
China. They were also farmers, landowners, and teachers, so
they were also terrorized by the Communist uprising, so they
also moved to Taiwan.
Q. Mr. Chin, are you yourself pro- or anti-CCP?
A. I am anti-CCP.
Q. Why are you anti-CCP?
A. First of all, based on my parents' families' experience and
also growing up in Taiwan in the '60s and '70s, the whole
climate is strongly anti-CCP.
Q. Now where did you move to after growing up in Taiwan,
Mr. Chin?
A. I moved to California to attend grad school in 1988.
THE COURT: Where did you go?
THE WITNESS: School?
THE COURT: Yes.
THE WITNESS: University of California San Diego.
Q. What were you studying at UC San Diego, Mr. Chin?
A. It's electrical engineering department.
Q. And what, if any, degree did you receive from UC San Diego?



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
A. I completed my PhD degree.
Q. Mr. Chin, since coming to the United States in your early
20s, have you lived in this country since then?
A. I've been living and working in the US from 1988 till 2008.
Q. And in 2008, where did you go then?
A. I took a job opportunity in Taiwan and moved to Taiwan.
Q. And how long did you stay in Taiwan then?
A. I spent ten years there.
Q. And after those ten years, where did you move next,
Mr. Chin?
A. I took another job opportunity in 2018——2018, and relocated
back to the US, in Texas.
Q. And have you been here since?
A. Yes.
Q. Mr. Chin, you mentioned this earlier, but remind us, when
did you first learn about Miles Guo?
A. I ran into his——one of the YouTube videos, and he discussed
an incidence of his interview being cut off by Voice of
America.
Q. You said Voice of America. For the jury, what is Voice of
America, Mr. Chin?
A. My understanding is the Voice of America is a broadcast or
media company. Even growing up in Taiwan, we heard Voice of
America's broadcast in both English and Chinese. We used——I
learned some English listening to Voice of America.



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
Q. And you said the video you watched where you learned about
Miles Guo related to Voice of America; is that right?
A. Correct.
Q. And what did Miles Guo say in that video about what had
happened with Voice of America?
A. Apparently he had an interview with Voice of America but
that interview was cut short on air abruptly, so he——he claims,
in his later video, that it's because Voice of America was
pressurized, pressured, or——by——by the CCP, so he cannot
continue his interview.
Q. And I apologize if you said this already, Mr. Chin, but
approximately what year was it that you watched this video?
A. It's 2017 or 2018, thereabouts.
Q. And what effect, if any, did watching this video and
hearing Miles Guo's claim have on you?
A. To have a live interview cut short like that is——I think
it's a very significant event, and so that seemed to add some
credibility to his claim that Voice of America——Voice of
America may have been influenced.
Q. After watching that initial video, Mr. Chin, how often, if
at all, did you start watching Miles Guo's videos?
A. I started following his YouTube video posts, just tried to
listen more and more what he has to say, and also later
followed his Twitter account.
Q. Did you read G News?



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
A. G News was later platform he——he formed, I think.
Q. And did you read G News ever?
A. I have.
Q. Mr. Chin, did there come a time when you began volunteering
as a Miles Guo supporter?
A. Yeah. There are many followers and——of his videos, and I
think it's at the beginning of the COVID, because there is——it
was really chaotic all over the world, and we——many
followers——he talked about COVID a lot too, and many followers
felt that the information coming out of China and going into
China are very——are not transparent, so many of us, the
followers, basically volunteered that, yes, we can do some
translation of the news from the credible US sources, outside
of China, and send those information back into China.
Q. And Mr. Chin, what kind of volunteer work did you yourself
do?
A. Just translate news articles and the information from, say,
John Hopkins Hospital, related COVID information.

account where you sent your $10,000 investment in GTV; is that
right?
A. Correct.

the only media that is not affected by CCP so it will be——the
voice of most Chinese people will be used.



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
Q. And at the time did you believe Miles Guo that there was
not a lot of risk in this investment?
A. At the time I did believe that.
Q. Mr. Chin, before 2020, had you participated in stock
investments?
A. Stock, yes.
Q. And in 2020 did you have a financial advisor?
A. I had a financial advisor to my retirement account but not
brokerage account.
Q. Would you describe yourself as a sophisticated investor?
A. No.
Q. Had you ever participated in a private placement?
A. No.
Q. What, if anything, did Guo say about who could participate
in private placements?
A. Private placement. It appeared to be a selective group.
You have to be invited, and you need to make a large sum of
investment. There is a large minimum.
Q. Was it your impression that normally unsophisticated
investors could participate in something like a private
placement?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. What, if anything, did Miles Guo say about who could
typically participate in a private placement?



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection. Asked and answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Mr. Chin, what time limit, if any, was there on your
participating in this private placement?
A. At the time it was——we were told that this opportunity
window was closing up soon so people who wants to participate
need to act quickly, within that month-ish time period,
March——April, May-ish time.
Q. Mr. Chin, had you ever invested in a hedge fund?
A. I have not.

about sending GTV investor funds to a hedge fund?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection. Which broadcasts?
MR. FERGENSON: Any broadcasts.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. He has never mentioned reinvesting to hedge fund.
Q. If you had known that Miles Guo was sending GTV investor
funds to a hedge fund, would you have invested in GTV?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection. Lack of foundation. We
dealt with this yesterday, your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
Q. Mr. Chin, if you had known that Miles Guo was sending GTV
investor funds to a hedge fund, would you have invested in GTV?
A. Most likely, no, because I was pretty simple mind that this
money will be used to build the platform, not reinvest.



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
Q. Now, Mr. Chin, what ended up happening to your money sent
to VOG?
A. Because I did not receive any return reply or receipt from
VOG, after asking them couple times through email, I had my
suspicion, and also some other followers who will have left the
group also alarmed me that this may be a scam. So I contacted
my bank, which wired the money to Wells Fargo, and the bank
investor contacted Wells Fargo, and within a couple weeks,
Wells Fargo was able to intercept that wire and return that
$10,000 to me.
Q. So ultimately you received the $10,000 you sent back from
the bank.
A. Yes.
Q. Mr. Chin, about how soon after you had sent the money to
VOG did you contact the bank about fraud?
A. Maybe two weeks-ish. No more than a month. Two weeks.
Yes.
Q. Mr. Chin, was this $10,000 transfer to VOG your only Miles
Guo-related investment?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection to form.
THE COURT: Overruled.
Q. Did you invest in other Miles Guo opportunities, Mr. Chin?

O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
Q. And around what time did you invest in G dollar?
A. About the same day or the next day of the——these two
investments were wired——were wired.
Q. At that time, Mr. Chin, what did you understand G dollar to
be?
A. At the time there are——I heard some claims also by Miles
that this money will be used to——to build a cryptocurrency or
purchase precious metals as a foundation of the movement.
Q. When you say precious metals, what sorts of things?
A. Gold. He mentioned that quite often.
Q. Mr. Chin, where did you send your G dollar money?
A. This was sent to a Capital One bank account located in New
York.
MR. FERGENSON: Ms. Loftus, could we please show
marked exhibits to the witness——just the witness——Government
Exhibits VC7 and VC8, please.
Q. Mr. Chin, what are these exhibits?
A. This is wiring instruction the followers get from a web
link.
MR. FERGENSON: Government offers Government Exhibits
VC7 and 8.
MR. KAMARAJU: No objection.
THE COURT: They are admitted.
(Government's Exhibits VC7 and VC8 received in
evidence)



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
MR. FERGENSON: And could we publish, please,
Ms. Loftus.
BY MR. FERGENSON:
Q. Now, Mr. Chin, you said these were wire instructions sent
to followers on a web link; is that right?
A. Correct.
MR. FERGENSON: Ms. Loftus——
Q. I want to focus you first on the one on the left, Mr. Chin.
MR. FERGENSON: Could we blow that one up, Ms. Loftus.
Q. All right. Now, Mr. Chin, at the very top it says G Dollar
Preorder. Do you see that?
A. Yes.
Q. What is the bank account name listed beneath that?
A. Bank account name. That's GTV Media Group.
Q. And do you know, Mr. Chin, why G dollar money was sent to
GTV?
A. At the time this was——I don't think this was clearly
defined because everything was promoted by——both entities were
promoted by——by Miles himself, so it's all related to GTV.
MR. FERGENSON: And you can zoom out, Ms. Loftus.
And if we could zoom on the one on the right.
Q. All right. Now this one says mail the check. Who is the
payee, Mr. Chin?
A. Payee will be GTV Media Group, Inc.
Q. All right. And then do you see the text about halfway or a



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
little lower that says tip, how much G dollar will receive? Do
you see that?
A. Yes.
Q. And then there's a chart beneath that. Do you see the
chart, Mr. Chin?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. Can you please explain what's shown in the chart.
A. It appears that you buy more, you get more. You buy——you
pay more than a hundred, you get 120.
MR. FERGENSON: Thank you, Ms. Loftus. We can take
this down for now.
Q. Mr. Chin, at the time you sent your $10,000 for G dollars,
what was happening in the news with respect to cryptocurrency
at that time?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection to form.
THE COURT: If you'll step up.
(Continued on next page)



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: What was happening in the news?
MR. FERGENSON: Yes, your Honor. It's relevant to the
promotion of cryptocurrencies at the time. The witness is
going to testify that at that time, cryptocurrency was booming
in the news, it was sort of the hot new fad. He's not going to
say those exact words. I'm sort of editorializing a little
bit. I believe the only objection was to form, your Honor, not
relevance.
MR. KAMARAJU: Because it is an improper question to
ask the witness what was happening generally in the news about
any topic, let alone cryptocurrency. If you're asking
particular questions of this witness, maybe——
MR. FERGENSON: I can ask him, what information were
you reading about cryptocurrency.
MR. KAMARAJU: Even that, I don't know what relevance
the promotions of other cryptocurrencies has to this particular
case.
MR. FERGENSON: He's just going to say there was a lot
of information about cryptocurrency and the coin was like, you
know, booming, it was part of why he invested.
MR. KAMARAJU: I'm still not sure——
THE COURT: You can ask him what motivated him to buy
this investment.
MR. FERGENSON: Okay.



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
THE COURT: Okay.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Sustained.
BY MR. FERGENSON:
Q. Mr. Chin, in addition to Miles Guo's statements, what, if
anything, motivated you to buy G dollars at that time?
A. Generally to still support this movement and also the claim
of potential return.
Q. Had you ever invested in a cryptocurrency before?
A. I have not.
Q. What, if anything, did Guo say about the risk of investing
in G dollars?
A. Also very much downplayed, basically just referred to
the——to the success of other cryptocurrency, that this will not
fail.
Q. And Mr. Chin, what happened to the money you sent to GTV
for G dollars?
A. Same as the other wire. I didn't receive any receipt. So
when I contacted my bank, I reported both——both wiring, so they
also contacted Capital One Bank, but Capital One Bank said the
money has been deposited or withdrawn so that money was not
returned, at that time.
Q. Did you get any cryptocurrencies for that $10,000?
A. I didn't receive anything.
Q. Did you get a receipt?



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
A. No.
Q. Ultimately, Mr. Chin, did you get any refund of that money?
A. Couple years later, through security exchange fair fund,
they eventually returned all the investors some of this money.
Q. You said Securities & Exchange. What are you referring to
there?
A. The SEC.
Q. The SEC?
A. Yes.
Q. The money that was returned to you through the SEC, did you
get a 100 percent refund or less than 100 percent?
A. Everyone received 92 some percent.
Q. Did Miles Guo pay back the missing 8 percent?
A. No.
Q. Mr. Chin, you've discussed reporting to your banks and
trying to reverse your investments. What caused you to have
doubts about your investments?
A. First of all, you don't——I didn't receive any even receipt,
so that's——that's the biggest alarm; and then meanwhile, there
are more and more people who have left the team before I did.
We also talked to each other, and they start to give me warning
that this is probably becoming a scam.
Q. What effect did that have on you?
A. I was——I——I feel all the good intention, not myself, many
people were abused, that we tried to support a pro-democracy



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Direct
movement or transparency of information to Chinese people, but
we were scammed.
Q. You said other people warned you. Can you please describe
why you think other people's warnings played a role in your
doubts.
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection to form and hearsay.
MR. FERGENSON: It's for its effect, your Honor.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. My feeling right now is, it's like other cult, right? When
you were——when you believe that, you believe the leader and you
cannot ask questions, but then some people who, quote-unquote,
wake up were able to have that effect on me, yeah.
Q. You used the phrase "wake up." Why do you use that phrase,
"wake up"?
A. That's how I feel because after I left the group, I feel
very relieved.
Q. Who was the leader of——who is the ultimate leader of this
group, Mr. Chin?
A. Miles Guo.
Q. Mr. Chin, for people who were still in the group, what, if
anything, did those people say about people who left the group?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
THE WITNESS: May I?
THE COURT: Go ahead.



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Cross
A. Okay. When, in the beginning, there were few people who
left, and they were very quickly labeled as traitor or CCP
spies. At the time it's very shocking, but it seems
believable. But as more and more people left and more and more
people were labeled as CCP, CCP spies, that became not very
reasonable. Yeah. And it is almost against his original
intent of a democracy movement, pro-democracy movement, because
people seems to——people cannot have different voice in the
team, in the group.
Q. Mr. Chin, at the time when you were a believer, what did
you think you were a part of?
A. I tried to focus myself just on the translation job,
collecting news, medical information, and try to translate
that, and I think on a small part, at the small part of a
bigger movement of pro-democracy movement.
Q. Looking back now, what do you think you were actually a
part of?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Right now I believe that was very elaborate scam.
MR. FERGENSON: Could I have a moment, your Honor.
No further questions.
THE COURT: Cross-examination.
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes. Thank you, your Honor.



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Cross
CROSS EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. Mr. Chin, since we've been having some problems with the
mic, can you hear me?
A. Yes, I can hear you.
Q. Okay. Thank you.
Good afternoon.
A. Yes.
Q. So I'd like to start where you started with the
prosecutors, I believe.
You talked about your family moving to Taiwan,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And that was the result of atrocities committed as part of
the Communist revolution in China, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And I believe you said that was because there was
infighting among the Communist party, right?
A. It has been called a civil war.
Q. Okay. A civil war. So a dispute, an internal conflict,
right?
A. Within China, yeah.
Q. And one set of members of the Communist party did not want
to release the other set from their group, right?
A. Can you say that again.



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Cross
Q. Sure. Let me try it this way. Very difficult to leave the
Chinese Communist Party, correct?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: You may answer. Go ahead.
A. From what I've learned, it seems that way.
Q. Okay. And you said that——and I apologize if I got this
wrong, so please correct me, but you mentioned that there was a
government that moved to Taiwan, correct?
A. The government before 1949 was Republic of China, and that
government right now is in Taiwan.
Q. Okay. So the government that existed in China before 1949
now exists in Taiwan.
A. Correct.
Q. All right. So it's an alternate government to the Chinese
Communist Party that runs mainland China, correct?
A. That becomes the politics.
Q. I'm just asking your understanding, sir.
A. It's current government ruling——controlling or ruling
Taiwan.
Q. Okay. But that government that resides in Taiwan believes
it's the legitimate government of China, right?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection, your Honor. He can't
testify to what that government believes.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Okay. Let me ask, is that your understanding, sir?



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Cross
A. No. Not right now. In the past, probably.
Q. Okay. That's fine.
THE COURT: Who is the leader of the enemy of the
Communist party in the 1940s? What was the name of the leader?
THE WITNESS: That would be Chiang Kai-shek.
THE COURT: And did he go to Taiwan?
THE WITNESS: He went to Taiwan.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. Now you mentioned, I believe, that you first came across
Mr. Guo on YouTube; is that right?
A. Correct.
Q. That was in 2017, correct?
A. Roughly, yes.
Q. Okay. And the first thing you saw about Mr. Guo was about
a Voice of America interview he had done, right?
A. Not the interview itself. He mentioned, discussing that
interview.
Q. Right. It was a video discussing the Voice of America
interview, correct, just to be clear?
A. Correct.
Q. And you said that he claimed that the Chinese Communist
Party had cut off the interview, right?
A. He claimed that the Voice of America cut it off due to the



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Cross
influence of CCP.
Q. Okay. And are you using the word "claimed" because you're
skeptical of that?
A. I couldn't verify that, right?
Q. Okay. Because you have no evidence one way or the other
about that, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And you have no way of knowing, correct?
A. No.
Q. Not then and not now, right?
A. Right now there actually are more information out, but
again, I cannot verify myself.
Q. Right. So you have no idea if there is an effort by the
Chinese Communist Party to silence Mr. Guo, correct?
MR. FERGENSON: Asked and answered, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Now I think you mentioned that——I'm not referring to the
Mr. Guo interview, but previously——you had been able to see
Voice of America in Taiwan, correct?
A. Not see; only listening to shortwave radio.
Q. Okay. Was it difficult to access Voice of America in
Taiwan?
A. Not in Taiwan.
Q. Okay. How about mainland China?
A. Difficult.



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Cross
Q. Why is that?
A. I've heard that it's illegal to listen to outside
broadcasts in mainland China.
Q. And when you say outside broadcasts, does that apply to
social media as well?
A. When I grew up, there was no social media. These are just
words, just radio broadcasts.
Q. Okay. So the censorship has been going on for a long time
then, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And that was one of the ideas behind G——apologies.
That was one of the ideas behind GTV, according to
your understanding, correct?
A. At the time that it was the claim, yes, and I believed
that.
Q. And that was based on the idea of breaking through
something called "the great firewall of China," correct?
A. I've heard that claim, yes.
Q. What does the phrase "the great firewall of China" mean?
A. My——my——I have limited understanding in that part of the
technology, but generally it's censorship.
Q. Okay. Censorship by who?
A. By CCP.
Q. Okay. And so GTV was intended to break through that?
A. That was the claim.



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Cross
Q. Okay. And that claim seemed reasonable to you?
A. At the time I——I believed that.
Q. Okay. Did you have any idea how GTV was going to
accomplish that goal?
A. No. That was never clearly explained.
Q. Okay. So right now I'm not asking what was explained; I'm
just asking whether you had any belief as to how that was going
to happen.
A. No. I wouldn't know, no.
Q. You've met with the prosecutors before, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. On several occasions, right?
A. Remote meeting, yes.
Q. Yeah. Whether remote or in person, you've met with them on
a number of occasions, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. And there were FBI agents there, right?
A. Correct.
Q. And there was somebody taking notes, right?
A. In remote meeting, I couldn't tell.
Q. How about the in-person meetings?
A. I did not see them taking notes.
Q. Okay. So you didn't observe anybody taking notes. But
isn't it true that you told the prosecutors that you thought
that GTV could break through the great firewall of China using



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Cross
satellite technology?
A. No, I have not said that.
Q. So you never mentioned Starlink to them?
A. No.
Q. And so if there were notes reflecting that, those notes
would be wrong, sir; is that your testimony?
A. Satellite and Starlink, no.
Q. Now when you were talking about the money that you sent to
Ms. Wei, you referred to it as Voice of Guo or Voice of Guo
Media, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Guo Media is a social media company, correct?
A. Guo Media claimed to want to do social media. Social media
platform was never built. It's just a name, Guo Media. That's
my understanding.
Q. So it's your testimony that Guo Media never actually
broadcast anything?
A. No. Guo——
MR. FERGENSON: Objection, your Honor. That wasn't
the testimony.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Guo Media never broadcast anything. All the broadcast by
Miles or by Sara, I'm not sure Guo Media label was put up there
as Guo Media, but everyone know it came from the same person.
Q. Well, the reason why I asked you is because you testified,



O5V1GUO3 Chin - Cross
I believe, that he claimed that Guo Media was a social media
company, correct?
A. Guo——Guo Media is a social company? My recollection, he
claimed that Guo Media will build a social platform, but that's
that.
Q. Okay. And that's the same claim you say that he made with
respect to GTV, correct?
A. Those names have been used interchangeably by him and
others, was not clearly defined what Guo Media, what GTV. It
was not clearly strictly defined. That's my recollection.
Q. Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. So when you
invested money in 2020, in May of 2020, did you think you were
investing in Guo Media?
A. At the time the money was sent to Voice of Guo account and
supposedly this will be pooled together to meet the hundred-K
threshold to be able to invest in the——however that is that's
going to be Guo Media, yes.
(Continued on next page)



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Cross
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. Okay. So the $10,000 that you sent to Ms. Wei, you
intended for that to be invested in Guo Media, that's your
testimony?
A. That's what we were told, that this money will go where
this money will go.
Q. Okay. Now, we've talked about Ms. Wei for a little bit.
You don't have a very high opinion of her; correct?
A. She was a early strong supporter, seems to be, and later I
stopped listen to her.
Q. You don't think she's very bright, right?
A. That's all personal opinion.
THE WITNESS: Do I have to answer?
THE COURT: Yeah, you can answer whether you think
she's bright or not.
A. I don't think she's highly educated.
Q. In fact, you've told the prosecutors that she is
incompetent; correct?
A. I don't think I told the prosecutors she's incompetent.
She's not -- I cannot recall if I used that word, but --
Q. Okay. Let's put to the side whether you used that specific
word. Did you express to them any word that suggested to them
that you thought she was incompetent?
A. Any word. I don't think I can recall exactly.
Q. Now, sir, during your testimony on direct you repeatedly



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Cross
referred to things that you believe Mr. Guo said; correct?
A. Correct.
Q. You have never spoken personally with Mr. Guo, right?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Okay. So he didn't say those things to you, right?
A. Not to me personally.
Q. So where did you hear them?
A. Where do I hear?
Q. Where did you hear them?
A. Mostly Twitter and YouTube.
Q. Like Twitter posts or what?
A. Twitter posts.
Q. So like typed-out Twitter posts?
A. Video, mostly video post.
Q. Okay. Which videos?
A. He has post many, many videos.
Q. Okay. Tell me the video where he downplayed the risk of
the GTV investment?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer, if you know.
A. I have them in my record. I cannot name the date right
now, but there are -- there was a video he said that the money
will grow quickly.
Q. What did he say specifically, sir?
A. In one of the video that I can recall, he said the money



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Cross
has grown so much in the past few days. And once it's open up
to more investor. This will grow tremendously, very large
numbers.
Q. Okay. In which video did he promise really high returns?
A. In his video, he would be promising hundreds or even more,
higher number for the return.
Q. Which video?
A. Again, the video that have translated for the -- for the
team.
Q. Okay. But the prosecutors didn't ask you about that
specific video, right?
A. While the early email communication I have forwarded a few
links to the investigator.
Q. Okay. But during your testimony in this courtroom, the
prosecutor didn't show you any of those statements, right?
A. During this court, in this --
THE COURT: When the prosecutor was asking you
questions, did he show you videos, just now?
THE WITNESS: Show video, no, no video.
Q. Now, you testified on direct that you believed that -- you
believed Mr. Guo's statements about getting higher returns;
correct?
A. At the time, yes.
Q. Okay. Isn't it true that during your very first meeting
with the prosecutors, you told them that you thought that his



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Cross
predictions of returns were ridiculous?
A. He claimed that everyone will be able to own a yacht like
that. That's obviously ridiculous. I didn't believe that.
Q. Okay. So you didn't believe that everybody would be able
to buy a yacht; you thought that was a ridiculous claim, right?
A. At the time that number was ridiculous even to me.
Q. Right. The returns he was predicting in your mind were
ridiculous, right?
A. Those large number were not reasonable.
Q. Okay. And, in fact, you also told the prosecutors that you
didn't have an anticipation of getting a return at all from
your GTV investment, right?
A. At the time my mindset is if there's some return, great; if
there's no return, I donated to a cause.
Q. Right. Because ultimately, the goal of you sending the
money to GTV was to support GTV's mission to break through the
great firewall of China; correct?
A. There was definitely some expectation of some return too.
Q. But didn't you just testify that if you didn't get a
return, okay, you donated to a cause?
MR. FERGENSON: Asked and answered.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Now, one of the reasons why it was important -- GTV's
mission was important to you personally is because you still
have family in China; correct?



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Cross
A. There are remote family, yeah.
Q. Okay. Now, did you watch a video by Mr. Guo when he
announced the GTV private placement?
A. Announced the private placement. There were many videos at
the time. I don't know exactly which one is announcement. But
at the time I watched many.
Q. How about one on April 20th, 2020, did you watch that?
A. I cannot recall the date exactly.
Q. Do you remember watching any video of his in April of 2020?
A. I don't memorize the date. I may have, but I --
Q. Okay. So when did you first hear about the potential GTV
investment?
A. It's also in that time frame he has been mentioning a
investment opportunity.
Q. When you say "in that time frame," are you talking about
the April time frame?
A. April, even late March, there were -- I recall there were
mentioning of the opportunity.
Q. Okay. And he was mentioning those, you said, in videos
posted online, right?
A. YouTube. Correct.
Q. YouTube.
Is it your testimony that you never saw him discuss a
GTV private placement on a Guo Media platform?
A. I do not know the exact distinction between these two.



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Cross
These two names or two entities were not clearly defined. It
was separated in my mind.
Q. Okay. Now, when you were evaluating the GTV investment
that you were going to make, you thought it was a risky
investment; correct?
A. At the time I thought, yes, it's risky.
Q. And you were unsure about making the investment; correct?
A. I had my doubt too, yes.
Q. You didn't contact Mr. Guo and try to address those doubts
with him, right?
A. I have not.
Q. But you did contact somebody to address those doubts,
right?
A. The email I send the money to, yes.
Q. Well, didn't you speak about your concerns with the GTV
investment with somebody who goes by the name Bird?
A. There's a lady with name called JamesBird, not just Bird,
JamesBird.
Q. Okay. Thank you.
So you spoke with JamesBird about your concerns prior
to investing?
A. There were discussions.
Q. I'm just trying to get clear, was that with JamesBird, this
discussion?
A. My understanding is that she also invested. And before the



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Cross
investment, there were discussion whether to make the
investment or not.
Q. Okay. Discussions between you and JamesBird, right?
THE COURT: Are you saying Jane Bird?
THE WITNESS: James.
THE COURT: James.
THE WITNESS: Last name Bird, but it's a she.
THE COURT: So is the last name JamesBird?
THE WITNESS: That's her online name.
THE COURT: I see.
THE WITNESS: JamesBird, the one word.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
BY MR. KAMARAJU:
Q. So I just want to be clear so the record is clear. When
you're referring to discussions, you're talking about
discussions between you and the person who goes by the name
JamesBird?
A. Correct.
Q. And based on those discussions, you then proceeded with
your investment; correct?
A. There are also discussions with a few more people, now I
don't recall the name; but, yes, there was at least one
discussion with JamesBird.
Q. Okay. So you vetted your investment decision with



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Cross
JamesBird and a few other people, right?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection. Mischaracterizing.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Okay. You discussed your investment decision with
JamesBird and a few other people; correct?
A. There was, yes.
Q. But none of those people were Miles Guo, right?
A. No.
MR. KAMARAJU: May I have just one moment, your Honor?
I'll try to organize a little bit.
Q. Now, around the time that you were making your GTV
investment, you also said that you were doing some translation
work on behalf of the movement; correct?
A. Correct.
Q. And so what were you translating exactly?
A. For example, at the time was -- that was COVID, and that a
number of death or infection inside China, outside China. I
mean inside China looks -- from statistic point of view looks
not reasonable.
So one of the job I did was collect the trend of
infection from several different country and make a comparison.
And said that -- explain that for infectious disease,
statistically it unlikely to have a zero or very low flat
infection number, right. Because most other countries have a
certain trend. But the statistics, people can see from China



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Cross
was -- looks odd from mathematic point of view, a mathematical
point of view.
Q. So the material that you were translating was health
information that you were trying to help people in China; is
that right?
A. Just to show that be careful what information they are
receiving, to have a second opinion, I guess.
Q. Okay. Because there's only one opinion allowed typically
in China; correct?
A. China is controlled by CCP.
Q. Right. And so it's the CCP's opinion that's allowed,
right?
A. It's a specific for health information or --
Q. Sure, let's stick with that.
A. There seems to be only one published data.
Q. Okay. And you testified on direct that Mr. Guo was also
talking about COVID; correct?
A. He -- he discuss about -- he discuss COVID too, yeah.
Q. And it was -- you translated some of his information about
COVID, right?
A. Most of the information I translated is public information
from the U.S. I collected. Some of his talks I translated to
English may also contain his opinion on COVID.
Q. Okay. So you translated, I think you used the word
"talks." So you translated talks that Mr. Guo gave about COVID



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Cross
and about other things, right?
A. About other things. There are COVID and other things;
correct.
Q. Like what other things?
A. The same thing. The corruption in mainland China, how bad
that was, things like that.
Q. Okay. And you thought that was important to get that
information to the people in China, right?
A. Just to -- again to perhaps open up more the information
flow or news flow.
Q. You testified on direct that you were no longer a follower,
right?
A. Correct.
Q. When did you stop becoming -- when did you stop being a
follower?
A. Since I didn't receive any receipt on my -- on my
investment.
Q. Okay. So that was in summer of 2020?
A. Correct. Since I ask investigator to investigate.
Q. I'm sorry, sir, are you finished with your answer?
A. Finished.
Q. Since you stopped being a follower of Mr. Guo, have you
still tracked the information that he puts out?
A. I didn't track his information, no.
Q. Have you been following what's been going on in Mr. Guo's



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Cross
life since you stopped being a follower?
A. No.
Q. Okay. So you have no idea if he is still wealthy or not,
right?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled. You can answer.
A. On YouTube sometimes those video pop up, but I have not
actively tracked or follow or search any of his whereabout.
Q. So you don't know if he still has a yacht, right?
MR. FERGENSON: Objection. Asked and answered.
MR. KAMARAJU: I know I've not asked that question
before.
THE COURT: I know. I know. You may answer, sir.
A. The question was?
Q. You don't know if he still has a yacht?
A. I wouldn't know either way. I wasn't following his --
Q. Okay. So I'm not going to go through each thing; I'll just
sum it up. All the luxury items that you talked about seeing
in the videos, remember you testified about that with the
prosecutor?
A. I did not follow, so --
Q. Okay. So you have no idea if he still has any of those
things, right?
A. There are -- there were video that pop up with him in that
apartment or on the yacht. But whether he still own or



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Cross
whatnot, I don't know more than -- any more than that.
Q. You testified on direct, sir, that you thought that you
woke up, I think was your word, because you spoke to a couple
of friends who told you it was a scam; is that right?
A. Basically, a few ex-followers who left the group before I
did.
Q. Were any of those ex-followers based in China, sir?
A. There was a friend who was a prior acquaintance. She was
based in China, but she did travel. She was also following
this -- all this Guo's video. She also contacted me separately
and warned me that this doesn't look right to her.
Q. All right. And this friend lives in Beijing; is that
right?
A. I said she travels around overseas as well. I don't know
exactly.
Q. One of the first claims that you said Mr. Guo made was that
he was -- VOA was pressured to take him off the air; correct?
A. That's his claim.
Q. And that happened in 2017, right?
A. I don't know the exact date, but I think that event
happened in 2017.
MR. KAMARAJU: Could we please have Exhibit DX
STIP-001, please. Can we go to paragraph 5.
Q. Can you read the first sentence, sir.
MR. KAMARAJU: If you could maybe highlight that for



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Redirect
him.
A. "To carry out some of the objectives of Fox Hunt, in 2017,
the PRC government tasked a specially designated group of
operatives ('the group') with discrediting and harassing
individuals, including Mr. Guo, by using interactive computer
services and electronic communication systems."
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. And then can we highlight the
sentence that says "The group's tactics aimed at Mr. Guo." And
go all the way through the end of that sentence.
Q. Can you read that sentence, please.
A. "The group's tactics aimed at Mr. Guo included using
anonymized social media accounts operated by the group and by
pressuring U.S. social media companies to remove Mr. Guo and
U.S.-based associates of Mr. Guo from social media platforms."
Q. Can you read the next sentence, please.
A. "These efforts were part of the PRC government's broader
effort to prevent, disrupt, and harass Mr. Guo's use of social
media and other online platforms to disseminate and discuss
disfavored content."
MR. KAMARAJU: No further questions.
THE COURT: Redirect.
MR. FERGENSON: Yes, your Honor.
REDIRECT EXAMINATION

O5UVGUO4 Chin - Redirect
between Guo Media and GTV, do you recall that?
A. Yes, I was asked.
Q. Is the difference between those two things clear to you?
A. At the time it was not very clear; it just all directed by
Miles Guo.
Q. And when you sent $10,000 to VOG, what did you understand
would happen with that money?
A. My understanding based on the claim was that this money
will be pooled together to meet 100,000 threshold to be able to
invest in the -- in the Guo Media.
Q. Was it Guo Media or GTV?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection, your Honor. Asked and
answered.

Miles Guo said about being targeted by the CCP. Do you
remember those questions?
A. Yes.
Q. What did Miles Guo say about the return on your GTV
investment?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection. Scope.

existing social media or media companies return.
Q. And what about your G dollar investment, what did he say



O5UVGUO4 Chin - Recross
about the returns on that?
A. He claimed that this -- first of all, this will absorb a
large amount of money. And then based on the -- implying that
based on the other cryptocurrencies' success, this will also be
successful.
Q. At the time when you were a follower, did you believe what
Miles Guo was saying?
A. At the time I did.
Q. And, in fact, Mr. Chin, did you make money or lose money on
these investments?
A. I lost.
Q. Did Miles Guo pay back your losses?
A. He did not.
Q. Are you still a follower of Miles Guo's today?
A. I'm not.
Q. Why not?
A. I think he has scammed, abused, many, many people's good
intention and our energy and the time. We try to do something
good, but we were cheated.

(Continued on next page)



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
(At sidebar)
MR. KAMARAJU: So my objection is that
Ms. Schottenheimer has not been noticed or proffered as an
expert witness on securities regulations; and yet she's being
asked — and I anticipate will continue to be asked — about
interpretations of various aspects of the Investment Advisers
Act and various securities regulations. And that is properly
the province of expert testimony before the Court.
THE COURT: Are you merely asking her about
credentials or qualifications for investing at a certain level?
MR. FINKEL: Yes. And she's not being offered as an
expert; but she's a lay witness in which her job is to evaluate
whether someone can be an investor in Hayman. That's very
relevant to all the conduct here.
THE COURT: Any average financial adviser knows this
is not expert testimony.
MR. KAMARAJU: Well, in Bilzerian , your Honor, United
States v. Bilzerian , the Second Circuit approved the use of
expert testimony to interpret SEC regulations.
THE COURT: Sure.
MR. KAMARAJU: I want to make sure that's not where
we're going.
THE COURT: My sense is that we're not going there.
MR. FINKEL: She's not interpreting regulations; she's
explaining her understanding of the requirements to invest in



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
Hayman Capital, which is very relevant because she evaluated
Mr. Kwok's investment in Hayman Capital GTV investor funds.
And that's her job. So determining whether someone is a
qualified purchaser, an accredited investor speaks to what she
does on a day-to-day basis. She'll be crossed on it and she's
not been certified as an expert by your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: But I don't think there's any dispute
as to Mr. Guo's ability to invest in Hayman Capital. The
dispute is whether there is -- whether there were unaccredited
investors allowed to invest in GTV. This witness's
understanding of what an accredited investor, it doesn't
matter.
THE COURT: It's not about GTV, am I correct?
MR. FINKEL: Well, two points in response to that,
your Honor:
First, I believe your Honor ruled in the motions in
limine that we are allowed to introduce the fact of the
unaccredited investor offering with respect to GTV.
With respect to whether this witness is about the GTV
offering, in a part, yes, because the GTV money that was
collected by Mr. Kwok and his co-conspirators was funneled into
the hedge fund that Ms. Schottenheimer works for. And so she's
not going to be interpreting SEC regulations and saying, I
believe this. She's talking about what she does every day.
This is her job.



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
THE COURT: But I don't consider this to be expert
testimony and I'm going to permit the questions.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you.
MR. KAMARAJU: Can I just have one clarification?
I'm allowed to then cross-examine her on her
understanding of the differences?
THE COURT: Between what and what?
MR. KAMARAJU: Between a qualified investor, which I
believe he's going to elicit, and a minimum investment
threshold.
THE COURT: Sure.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay.

(In open court)
THE COURT: You may continue.
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is a 3(c)(7) objection? Excuse
me. Objection was overruled.
What is a 3(c)(7) exception?
A. A 3(c)(7) exception is something that comes from the '40
Act rule under SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission,
directive. And basically a 3(c) fund -- a 3(c)(7) fund is how
Hayman sets up their hedge funds.
Q. What is a qualified purchaser?
A. For an individual, a qualified purchaser is someone that
has $5 million in marketable securities.
Q. And what about for an entity?
A. For an entity that is not a family limited partnership,
they have to have $25 million in pooled or in net assets.
Q. How, if at all, is the qualified purchaser definition
relevant to your work at Hayman Capital?
A. So because I am in charge of marketing to potential
clients, I have to verify that everyone that I'm speaking to or
providing information about our funds is, in fact, a qualified
purchaser.
Q. What is the term "accredited investor"?
A. An accredited investor is someone that has a million
dollars of net worth, or $300,000 of combined income with their



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
spouse, or $200,000 of income as an individual.
Q. Can someone who's an accredited investor, but not a
qualified purchaser, invest in a Hayman product?
A. No, they cannot.
Q. In these thresholds, qualified purchaser, accredited
investor, what entity, if at all, establishes those thresholds?
A. The Securities and Exchange Commission.
Q. And what is your understanding of why those thresholds are
established by the SEC?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. Can you please repeat the question.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is the SEC?
A. The Securities and Exchange Commission.
Q. What is your understanding, if any, about why the SEC
establishes these thresholds of accredited investor and
qualified purchaser?
A. To protect individuals that don't have these thresholds
from investing in what's considered to be higher-risk
investment funds.
Q. And the financial products that Hayman offers, are they
high-risk financial products?
A. They are considered to be by the SEC, yes. It's a hedge
fund.
Q. Okay. And in sort of layman's terms, what do you mean by



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
"higher risk"?
A. Typically, a hedge fund can invest not just in the stock
market or the bond market, they can participate in lots of
different types of securities, over-the-counter options,
over-the-counter forwards, commodities. It has a very large
bandwidth of the types of financial products that they can --
that a hedge fund can invest in. And these types of products
are considered to be more high risk.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, is part of your job evaluating whether
potential clients are, in fact, qualified purchasers?
A. Yes.
Q. And what does Hayman do, if anything, to validate whether a
potential investor is a qualified purchaser?
A. If I had reverse inquiry that comes into investor relations
at Hayman, I send them what's called a new contact
questionnaire. It is a section out of our subscription booklet
that, you know, asks a couple of background information like
their name, date of birth, phone number, email address, as well
as an accredited investor representation and a qualified
purchaser representation.
So once I have these on file, I know that they have
made the QP rep, and I am able to provide them information on
the funds that Hayman offers.
Q. What's a QP rep, what's that mean?
A. A qualified purchaser representation, meaning --



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
A. Meaning that they, in fact, are an individual that has $5
million in marketable securities.
Q. And what's a reverse inquiry?
A. A reverse inquiry is when someone reaches out to Hayman
inquiring about the different products that we offer.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what work, if any, does Hayman do to
validate or check the representations made by potential
investors claiming they are qualified purchasers?
A. We take the representation as-is. There's no further
checking. It's not required.
Q. What is KYC?
A. Know your customer or know your client.
Q. What does that mean in the context of the work you do at
Hayman?
A. We have what's called anti-money laundering procedures in
place when an investor makes an investment into one of our
funds. And it is basically a grid or a checklist of the
information that we're required to collect and keep on file.
Q. And what sort of information does Hayman collect as part of
its KYC obligations?
A. It's a long list. A lot of it is included in the
subscription document that the investor completes in order to
subscribe to a fund. But on a high level, the name, address,
Social Security number, date of birth, and a copy of a valid



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
state-issued driver's license, passport. And we collect this
on behalf of if someone is investing in their name, the
investor. And then if it's an entity, we collect this
information on behalf of the authorized signatory, as well as
the -- any beneficial owners over I think it's 20 percent.
Q. What is AML?
A. Anti-money laundering.
Q. How is that term relevant, if at all, to the work you do at
Hayman?
A. So anti-money laundering is -- we call them AML checks.
And so this falls kind of within the know-your-customer or
know-your-client process. And this AML checklist is actually
what we use as part of the closing process to collect all the
data that we need.
Q. These AML and KYC checks, why, if at all, does Hayman do
them?
A. We are required to.
Q. By whom?
A. The SEC.
Q. What is the term UBO?
A. You said UBL?
Q. UBO. O.
A. UBO.
Q. Have you heard that term before?
A. Ultimate beneficial owner.



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. What's an ultimate beneficial owner?
A. An ultimate beneficial owner is who actually owns the
entity.
Q. And how is the concept of an ultimate beneficial owner
relevant, if at all, to your work at Hayman?
A. For AML purposes, we are required to drill down into an
entity, so we have XYZ entity invest. And I need to collect
AML on any individual that owns more than 20 percent of the
entity. And sometimes an entity is owned by an entity, and you
just keep going down until you actually get to an individual;
and so you can do an AML check on that individual.
Q. And why does Hayman go through all those steps about
ultimate beneficial owners?
A. Because we are required to under our AML practices that are
required to by the -- required by the SEC.
MR. FINKEL: Can I have one moment, your Honor?
THE COURT: Yes.
(Counsel conferred)
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer I think you used the term "drill down"
on the various ultimate beneficial owners. Can you just
explain to the members of the jury what that means in the
context of your work?
A. Absolutely.
So if there's an entity, we say does anyone or any
entity own more than 20 percent of this entity. And if the



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
answer is yes, then we collect. If it's a person -- it's
basically just a grid that goes down. If it's a person, then
we collect the five AML requirements on that person. If it's
an entity, then we would have to go to the next layer. Does
anyone own 20 percent of this entity; is it a person or is it
another entity? And then you just continue to go until you
actually have what we consider an ultimate beneficial owner.
Q. Are you familiar with the concept in your work at Hayman of
parent entities and subsidiaries?
A. Broadly familiar, yes.
Q. And what does that mean?
A. A parent company is the company that owns -- is the -- a
parent company owns subsidiaries.
Q. Does Hayman also inquire with clients who wish to invest in
a Hayman product what the source of the money is that they're
using for an investment?
A. Source of money? No.
Q. What about source of funds?
A. No.
Q. Is a potential investor required to report where the money
came from that they are using to invest in a Hayman financial
product?
A. The specific capital being allocated, no.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, have you ever met an individual known
as Miles Kwok?



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know him by any other names?
A. Miles Guo.
Q. Do you see him in the courtroom here today?
A. I do.
Q. Can you point him out and identify --
MR. KAMARAJU: We'll stipulate to identity, your
Honor.
THE COURT: All righty.
Q. When was the first time that you met Miles Kwok?
A. I met Miles Kwok in October of 2018.
Q. And what was the name that you were -- that you understand
Miles Kwok to use at that time?
A. Miles Kwok.
Q. Where did you meet him?
A. I met him in Dallas, Texas, at an airplane hangar.
Q. Who was Miles Kwok with?
A. Miles Kwok was with Steve Bannon and William Je.
Q. At that time, 2018, Ms. Schottenheimer, what was your
understanding of Miles Kwok's relationship with William Je?
A. At that time William Je was introduced to me as Miles's
interpreter for the interview that they were there to conduct.
Q. And what was your understanding of Miles Kwok's
relationship with Steve Bannon at that time?
A. That they were friends.



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. Was Kyle Bass also present at that time?
A. Yes.
Q. You mentioned that there was an interview. What do you
mean?
A. So the reason why we were all at the hangar that day in
Dallas was because Kyle was going to interview both Steve
Bannon in a single interview and, in a separate interview,
interview Miles Kwok.
Q. And at that time, Ms. Schottenheimer, in 2018, what was
your understanding of Kyle Bass's relationship with Miles Kwok?
A. That they had been introduced through Steve Bannon and had
a lot of similar views of China, the financial -- China's
financial system, and the communist party of China.
MR. FINKEL: If we can please display what I believe
is in evidence as Government Exhibit 103.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, who is this individual?
A. This is William Je.
MR. FINKEL: And if we can please display for the
witness, witness only, what's been marked for identification as
Government Exhibit 123.
Q. Who is this individual?
A. Steve Bannon.
MR. FINKEL: Government offers 123.
MR. KAMARAJU: No objection.
THE COURT: It is admitted.



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
(Government's Exhibit 123 received in evidence)
MR. FINKEL: Publish that, please.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, how did Miles Kwok arrive to the
airplane hangar where this interview took place?
A. It was my understanding that he had flown into a separate
FBO.
Q. What's an FBO?
A. I don't know the acronym, but basically there are different
FBOs at the airport. It's basically a different hangar as to
where the airport -- the airplane lands and is stored.
MR. FINKEL: We can take that down, Ms. Loftus.
Q. You mentioned that there is to be an interview that
Mr. Bass was going to conduct. What sort of interview at that
time period did Mr. Bass conduct?
A. So there is a show called -- sorry, there's a group called
Reel Vision. And it is a series -- it's an interview series
that people can subscribe to. And Kyle has a number of
different people that he's -- interviews with a number of
different people, as well as people interviewing him.
Q. And did Mr. Bass, in fact, interview Miles Kwok in this
airplane hangar?
A. He did.
Q. Did you witness that?
A. I did.
MR. FINKEL: If we can display for the witness,



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
please, what's been marked for identification as GX 1007-V1.
Apologies. This is Government Exhibit W1007-V1. My fault.
Ms. Loftus, can you scroll through that so
Ms. Schottenheimer can take a look at that.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, do you recognize this?
A. Yes. This is the Reel Vision interview that was conducted
between -- Kyle Bass interviewed Miles Kwok.
MR. FINKEL: Government offers GX W1007-V1.
MR. KAMARAJU: No objection.
THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Government's Exhibit W1007-V1 received in evidence)
MR. FINKEL: If we can publish that, please,
Ms. Loftus. Bring it back to the beginning. And if we can
please play this, Ms. Loftus.
(Video played)
MR. FINKEL: Pause it there.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, first, who is the individual on the
screen?
A. That is Miles Kwok.
Q. And who is the other individual?
A. Kyle Bass.
Q. There are some terms that Mr. Bass and Mr. Kwok use. First
term they use is something called FX reserves. What is your
understanding of what that means?
A. Foreign exchange reserves is in context of -- just broadly



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
is -- foreign exchange reserves is something that a country
keeps on their balance sheet.
Q. And Mr. Kwok uses a term called the M2. What is that?
A. M2 is money in circulation.
Q. And this minute and 50-second clip that we watched,
Ms. Schottenheimer, just generally speaking, what is it that
Mr. Kwok and Mr. Bass are discussing?

MR. FINKEL: Can you play from there, please,
Ms. Loftus.
(Video played)
MR. FINKEL: Pause it there, please.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is this chart that Mr. Bass
referred to that Mr. Kwok had provided him, Mr. Bass?
A. It's a comparison of the U.S. and Chinese GDP versus
currency supply.
Q. How is that, if at all, relevant to what Mr. Kwok and
Mr. Bass are discussing?
A. That China just grew its currency supply at a massive rate
in order to kind of grow its economy.
Q. This chart, aside from this interview, have you seen it in
other places?
A. Yes. Kyle asked permission from Miles to put it in our --
one of our decks.
Q. Can you explain what you mean by "decks"?



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. Yes. One of our presentations.
I can't recall exactly which one, but we have an
evolving Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund presentation that
we put in updated charts from time to time. And I recall
having a snapshot at the beginning of this graphic and a
snapshot at the end inserted into the presentation.
Q. So this graphic came from Mr. Kwok, and Mr. Bass used it in
a presentation he made?
A. Correct. Yes.
Q. If I can ask, Ms. Schottenheimer, to point the microphone
directly at your mouth, it's directional, and everyone can hear
you. Thank you.
MR. FINKEL: And Ms. Loftus, we can continue to play
this video.
(Video played)
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, Mr. Bass asked the question: Why does
the Hong Kong dollar have a peg?
What is your understanding of what that means? What
is the Hong Kong dollar peg?
A. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar. It's
actually -- it's banded to the U.S. dollar, meaning there's ten
cents of kind of flexibility that it trades within.
Q. What does it mean for a currency to be pegged to another
currency?



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. Basically, one currency adopts the value of another
currency, and it pegs its currency to that second currency.
Q. Based on your understanding, how does the Hong Kong economy
actually peg its dollar to the U.S. dollar?
A. So there's something called the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority. And the HKMA maintains U.S. dollars and U.S. dollar
assets on its balance sheet in order to maintain the peg to the
U.S. currency.
Q. Approximately how long has this peg been in place?
A. Since October of 1983.
Q. And is this peg still in place today?
A. It is.
Q. And in 2018, when this interview took place,
Ms. Schottenheimer, what was Hayman Capital's view about
whether that peg would persist?
A. Hayman had the view that the Hong Kong peg no longer made
sense and it would cease to exist in some period of time.
Q. And did Hayman Capital offer any financial products around
this time, 2018, based on that thesis?
A. Yes.
Q. And what was that financial product called?
A. Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund.
MR. FINKEL: We can continue playing from there,
Ms. Loftus.
(Video played)



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is your understanding of what
Mr. Kwok is saying is fake versus true?
A. So as you saw from the graphic, China had
disproportionately grown their economy through just by printing
money, putting additional money supply into the economy, so
essentially propping it up. Hong Kong has a real economy
that's essentially tied to the U.S. dollar is the difference, I
think, is what he is referring to.
MR. FINKEL: If we can please display for the witness
what's been marked for identification as GX W1007-V3. Can you
just scrub through that so Ms. Schottenheimer can take a look.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is this?
A. This is still the Reel Vision interview between Kyle Bass
and Miles Kwok.
Q. Is it a clip of that interview?
A. Yes.
Q. Approximately how long was the whole interview?
A. An hour.
MR. FINKEL: The government offers GX W1007-V3.
MR. KAMARAJU: No objection.
THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Government's Exhibit W1007-V3 received in evidence)
MR. FINKEL: Ms. Loftus, after you publish that, if I
could ask you to please roll to the beginning and play it for



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
the members of the jury.
(Video played)
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, towards the beginning of that clip,
Mr. Bass said something that this is a big problem; Mr. Kwok
disagrees and says it's not a big problem. What is your
understanding of what they are referring to?
A. I'd have to see the beginning of the clip again.
MR. FINKEL: Can we play the beginning of the clip.
(Video played)
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is your understanding?
A. So Kyle is talking about the dwindling excess reserves that
are supporting the Hong Kong dollar.
The way that it works is when the Hong Kong dollar
trades to $7.75, it is at the strong side of the band. So the
HKMA needs to come in and intervene to keep the Hong Kong
dollar within the band. And so it sells its U.S. dollars to
buy Hong Kong dollars.
Same thing when it trades to the weak side of the
band, just $7.85 Hong Kong dollar per U.S. dollar. So then the
HKMA needs to come in and buy U.S. dollars and -- sorry, buy
Hong Kong dollars and sell U.S. dollars.
And what Kyle is referring to is they have spent 78
percent of their excess reserve; so their ability to maintain
this peg has dwindled from 100 percent down to 38 percent. And
that is what Kyle is talking about.



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. And Mr. Kwok disagrees with that. And what is his view?
A. His view is that it's just two options. He wants to take a
step back and talk about how Hong Kong has the ability to
become a fake economy just like China. They can lie about
their numbers, they can print their way out of the problem; or
they can show the world that they don't have enough excess
dollars to maintain the peg, which to me kind of goes back to
Kyle's first point.
Q. And if the second option comes to pass that there's not
enough dollars to maintain the peg, what would happen?
A. Likely the market would call out Hong Kong and there would
be a stress to the peg; it would trade outside of the peg and
likely eventually break.
Q. You used the term "band" when you were explaining. Can you
just explain the band?
A. The band. Yes.
The Hong Kong dollar trades within a band to the U.S.
dollar. $7.75 Hong Kong dollar per U.S. dollar, and then the
range goes -- on the other side of that is $7.85. So 7.75 to
7.85 is the Hong Kong band to the U.S. dollar.
Q. You mentioned before that Hayman offers something called
the Hong Kong Opportunities Fund?
A. Yes.
Q. Can you describe what the Hong Kong Opportunities Fund is.
A. The Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund is a hedge fund



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
product that has a specific strategy where it is bearish on the
Hong Kong dollar and it is dedicated to just shorting the Hong
Kong dollar.
Q. So if the peg, the band, were to break, what impact would
that have on an investment in the Hong Kong Opportunity Fund?
A. It would have a positive monetary impact on the Hong
Kong -- the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund.
Q. And, Ms. Schottenheimer, broadly speaking, is the Hong Kong
Opportunity Fund a risky investment?
A. Yes.
Q. And why is that?
A. Well, specifically, in Share Class B, which is a dedicated
share class to expressing this trade 100 percent in options,
meaning that if the options expire out of the money, you would
lose 100 percent of your investment.
Q. You mentioned something called share Class B. Does that
have another name?
A. Yes, Share Class B is the Prodigious Series.
Q. When did Hayman start offering as an investment the Hong
Kong Opportunity Fund?
A. Share Class A?
Q. Sure.
A. Okay. The original Hayman -- yes, January of 2017.
Q. And when did Share Class B, the Prodigious Series, become
available?



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
A. The first closing was June of 2020.
MR. FINKEL: We can take that down, Ms. Loftus.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, did there come a time, if ever, when
Miles Kwok sought to invest in a Hayman product?
A. Yes.
Q. When approximately was that?
A. May of 2020.
Q. And what was your role, if any, in Kwok's sought Hayman
investment?
A. I'm responsible for coordinating and processing the
subscription booklet.
Q. And what investment -- or excuse me. Withdrawn.
What financial product did Kwok invest in?
A. He invested in the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund
Share Class B/Prodigious Series.
Q. And how large was Kwok's investment in the prodigious
series?
A. $100 million.
MR. FINKEL: We can display for the witness what's
been marked for identification as GX HN-26. Just flip through
it so Ms. Schottenheimer can take a look at it. Go back to the
first page, please.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is HN-26?
A. This is an email to William Je from myself on Saturday, May
23rd, 2020, of me sharing the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
Fund prodigious series presentation and a playback link to the
webcast that Kyle had hosted earlier that month.
MR. FINKEL: Government offers HN-26.
MR. KAMARAJU: No objection.
THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Government's Exhibit HN-26 received in evidence)
MR. FINKEL: If we can publish that, please,
Ms. Loftus. And if you can zoom in at the top, please. You
can see the text. Perfect.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, now that the jury can see it, to whom
did you send this email?
A. William Je.
Q. And why did you send this email to William Je?
A. Because Kyle Bass asked me to.
Q. And what's the date of this email?
A. May 23rd, 2020.
Q. And what's the subject?
A. Confidential Playback Details Hayman Hong Kong
Opportunities Fund LP Prodigious Series.
Q. And what is your understanding of why Kyle Bass asked you
to send this email to William Je?
A. Because Miles was interested in potentially investing.
Q. In what product?
A. The Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund Share Class B
Prodigious Series.



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. And, Ms. Schottenheimer, in this time, May of 2020, what
was your understanding of William Je's role with respect to
Miles Kwok?
A. That he was the head or chief investment officer of Miles'
family office.
Q. By "family office," you mean what?
A. Family office is a dedicated investment office to managing
the wealth of an individual. So this was an office -- this was
a group of people dedicated to managing the wealth of Miles
Kwok.
MR. FINKEL: We can zoom out of that, Ms. Loftus, and
go to the next page of the document, please. Zoom in on that.
Q. What is this a picture of?
A. This is a picture of the leader of the Chinese Communist
Party, Xi Jinping.
Q. And is there a watermark on this Power Point?
A. Yes.
Q. Why is that?
A. Because we track all of the presentations that we send to
potential investors.
Q. And what is the watermark on this particular Power Point?
A. William Je, it's his email address.
MR. FINKEL: You can go, please, to page 34 of this,
Ms. Loftus. Let's go back a page -- or forward a page, excuse
me.



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, can you read the first bullet on this
page?
A. "Targeting notional exposure of approximately 200 times
each dollar invested given current pricing as of May 4th,
2020."
Q. And what does that mean?
A. So based on pricing in early May, we were targeting being
able to achieve 200 times exposure for every dollar invested
being short the Hong Kong dollar via the Hong Kong dollar
options that we were purchasing.
Q. And 200 times the dollar investment, can you just explain
that?
A. Correct. If you invest one dollar, you'd be short $200 of
U.S. -- of Hong Kong dollars.
Q. Generally speaking, Ms. Schottenheimer, in your role as
managing director of investor relations, how does Hayman market
this product, the Prodigious Series, to potential investors?
A. We market this as a very high-risk/potential high-return
strategy.
Q. And what is your understanding of why investors invest in
it?
A. There's typically two buckets of investors that are
interested in investing in our Hong Kong product. The first is
a defensive position, meaning they're using this as a hedge for
their broader portfolio. They might have some sort of exposure



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
to emerging markets, direct exposure to China, Asia. And this
is a defensive play, meaning they have -- they put a very small
allocation of their overall portfolio into this product to
protect them if the second largest economy were to have a
substantial dislocation.
Q. And what's the offensive play?
A. The offensive play is when an investor understands that
this risk in being priced in the marketplace is -- it's wrong,
that it's way too cheap and that it will be repriced over time.
Q. The fourth bullet, Ms. Schottenheimer, starts "Capital
Exhaustion Strategy."
A. Yes.
Q. Read that and explain to the members of the jury what that
means.
A. Capital exhaustion strategy employs maximum capital
efficiency. So when we offer in this product is -- you can put
a $25,000 minimum to invest in this product and it's very
capital efficient, meaning that every dollar that you invest is
going to provide massive notional exposure. You kind of refer
to that first bullet point of 200 times.
MR. FINKEL: If we can go to the next page, please,
Ms. Loftus. The page after that. Thank you.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, what is management fee, which I believe
is the fourth row of this line?
A. Yes. There's a onetime management fee when investing in



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
the Prodigious Series. And essentially it's a fee to the asset
manager for managing the capital.
Q. And the asset manager here would be who?
A. Hayman Capital Management.
Q. And then I think two rows below that it says lock, two-year
hard lock. What does that mean?
A. Well, the strategy was only -- it's an 18 to two-year --
sorry, it's a 12-month to 24-month strategy. And so the
two-year lock implies that there is no ability to get your
capital out. Once you invest, it's permanently invested in the
fund. There's no -- there's no rights to withdraw your
capital.
Q. Ms. Schottenheimer, can investment in the Prodigious Series
take down the CCP?
A. No.
Q. Can an investment in the Prodigious Series affect the
Chinese economy?
MR. KAMARAJU: Objection.
THE COURT: You'll have to step up.
(Continued on next page)



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
(At sidebar)
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, should we just send the jury
home?
THE COURT: Yes, I think it's a good idea.
MR. FINKEL: Okay.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Members of the jury, it's 2:45, so it's
time to end for the day.
Remember that you are not permitted to discuss the
case amongst yourselves or with anyone else. Don't permit
anybody to discuss the case with you. Have a good evening and
get back here tomorrow on time. Thank you.
(Jury not present)
THE COURT: Please be seated.
MR. KAMARAJU: Your Honor, do you want to excuse the
witness?
THE COURT: Oh, yes. If you'll step down.
Don't discuss your testimony.
(Witness not present)
THE COURT: I'll hear the objection.
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes, your Honor.
So I understand that she was not qualified as a
securities expert, she wasn't noticed. She certainly has not
been noticed as an expert on macroeconomics and the impact that
any particular strategy may have on the broader Chinese



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
economy. I don't know if she even has the expertise to opine
on that, given that she's in investor relations; as far as I
know, not an actual economist. And her personal perspective
with respect to whether it would impact the Chinese economy has
no relevance in the case.
MR. FINKEL: So, your Honor, if the defense wants to
stipulate that the defendant did not believe, excuse me, that
this investment would have any impact on the Chinese economy,
then, yeah, it wouldn't be relevant. I'm not sure exactly what
their point is on that.
MR. KAMARAJU: We're not stipulating to that at all.
But this particular witness's view as to whether that happens
or could happen has no bearing on Mr. Guo's perspective
certainly. But also, again, she is not offered as an expert to
testify about the macroeconomic effects of a particular
strategy. If she wants to talk about that was not Hayman's
intent or that was not her understanding about what Hayman was
trying to do, that's one thing. But to talk about it broadly,
you for sure have a 403 issue at that point. Because now we're
going to have to start talking about all the ways in which it
could, the various economic trends that might apply.
I don't know how we go from this witness testifying
about the process of qualifying Mr. Guo for this investment to
the broader question about what will or will not take down the
CCP or the Chinese economy.



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
MR. FINKEL: So, your Honor, if the defense, as it
seems to be, is going to assert that Mr. Guo believed that this
investment would take down the CCP, it is certainly relevant
what Ms. Schottenheimer, who is the managing director of
investor relations for this particular financial products, what
her view and Hayman's view is of the impact of this financial
product in fact on whether it can take down the CCP or impact
the broader Chinese economy.
There are two reasons why this is the case: The first
reason, your Honor, is Ms. Schottenheimer is the one who
interacted with William Je about this particular investment.
So certainly Hayman's view and Ms. Schottenheimer's view, her
interactions with Mr. Je are relevant to the jury's
consideration, which appears to be the defense that Mr. Guo
believed this financial product could take down the CCP. If
that's their defense, we have an opportunity to essentially put
in evidence that goes against it. If they want to back off
that and say that that's not their defense or they'll stipulate
it won't affect the Chinese economy, that's fine. If they
don't, they're free to cross-examine her on these issues.
THE COURT: So are you going to elicit testimony that
she discussed this opinion with Mr. Je?
MR. FINKEL: So, your Honor, she -- I don't know if
that happened is the answer to the Court's question directly.
What I do know is that Ms. Schottenheimer, her job is



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
this deck which was sent to Mr. Je, which is a representation
of what Hayman believed this financial product does. I also
know that Ms. Schottenheimer has a view which she explained in
part today about the purpose of this financial product and,
importantly, how Hayman markets it.
Now, Mr. Bass, as has been clear from
Ms. Schottenheimer's testimony and from the video we watched,
has a negative view of the CCP, so does Ms. Schottenheimer.
But they know — because, in fact, it is true — that this
financial investment doesn't impact the CCP. It's a bet. It's
a way to make money or hedge against losing money.
And so if the defense is going to argue that Mr. Guo
in his heart of hearts believed that this financial investment
could take down the CCP, the government, which has the burden,
has the ability to introduce evidence to the contrary. And I
say again, your Honor, that to the extent the defense is not
seeking to make that defense, then yes, this wouldn't be
relevant.
MR. KAMARAJU: So I'd like to make just a couple of
points on it, and I think there are a few distinctions that are
important.
First of all, Ms. Schottenheimer's job as investor
relations is not to design the investment products. She's very
clear about that. The witness who does that is Mr. Bass. What
she does is she communicates with potential investors,



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
qualifies them whether they can purchase it, and then takes in
their subscription information. She does not set the
investment policy at all. She does not design it, she's not
the person who creates it, she's not the person who runs the
models for it, she doesn't do any of that. And if Mr. Finkel
asked her if she did any of that on the stand, she would say
no.
Second, in her 3500 material, she makes clear that she
has never spoken with William Je on the phone. So the only
communications that the government has produced to the defense
— and I don't know if they have any others — are ones -- are
email communications, none of which mention
Ms. Schottenheimer's opinion as to whether this could take down
the CCP or not, or Hayman's opinion more broadly.
THE COURT: Is there anything in the deck concerning
their opinion about the impact of this product on the Chinese
economy?
MR. KAMARAJU: He just showed her the deck, your
Honor.
THE COURT: I'm asking him.
MR. KAMARAJU: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were
asking me still, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: So, your Honor, yes. I mean, the deck is
about Hayman's view of that the Chinese economy -- this is in
2020, when they sent this deck, that the Chinese economy is



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
faltering, and that there's stress that's being put in
particular on the Hong Kong Central Bank. And as a result of
that stress, the peg or the band, as Ms. Schottenheimer
explained it, is going to break.
And what this financial product is designed to do,
which Ms. Schottenheimer may not have designed, but knows how
it works because her job is to market it to investors and
explain it to people. That's what she does. She travels the
world doing that, in fact, so she has knowledge of it. Even if
she wasn't the one in the Excel sheet deciding which swaps to
invest in, she certainly knows how it works.
And so the way that Hayman markets this product and
was marketed through email to William Je and in other ways, is
relevant to the consideration that the jury is going to make,
which apparently is their defense that they haven't disclaimed.
Their defense is apparently Mr. Guo believed that an investment
of $100 million of GTV investor money into Hayman's Hong Kong
Opportunities Fund was a way to fight the CCP, making the
broader point that everything is fine here, ladies and
gentlemen, because all these investors really cared about was
taking down the CCP and that's what this investment was going
to do.
In fact, your Honor, that's not true. And
Ms. Schottenheimer knows it's not true. And she's entitled to
explain that to the jury. It will be for the jury, not for me,



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
not for defense counsel, but for the jury to decide whether
Ms. Schottenheimer's view or the defense's view is the correct
view. But they are entitled to evidence on both sides of the
coin.
MR. KAMARAJU: Your Honor, first of all, the question
that was asked was not about Hayman's intent or
Ms. Schottenheimer's intent in designing the fund. It was:
Can an investment in this fund take down the CCP, and can it
take down the Chinese economy. There's a distinction between
what the fund decided to do when it designed the products and
what the actual impact in the real world would be.
THE COURT: One second.
Would you agree with me that there's a difference
between making a representation that cryptocurrency is a safe
investment, a legitimate investment, and giving an opinion
about cryptocurrency on the world economy?
MR. FINKEL: Are you asking me, your Honor?
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. FINKEL: So, yes. But I think there's a
distinction between that hypothetical — which I agree with your
Honor on — and what's happening here.
And there still hasn't been from the defense any
disclaiming of a defense about Mr. Guo's view. And therefore,
I think Ms. Schottenheimer is entitled to at least — and I can
frame the question this way: Based on her understanding, how



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
does this financial product work and what is its effect based
on her understanding. And I am certain that the defense will
cross-examine her on that --
THE COURT: I understand that you'd like to bring out
her opinion, but she's not an economist.
MR. FINKEL: So, your Honor, it's not her opinion.
It's her understanding. To the extent it's an opinion, it's a
701 opinion based on her perceptions as an employee of Hayman
Capital. And we don't need to introduce, I don't think, your
Honor, because we have a percipient witness, a 702 expert on
the mechanics of this particular investment.
We have a witness who is familiar with how this
product is marketed, how this product works, and has an
understanding of how it works in the broader economy. That
understanding is certainly relevant under Rule 401. There's
not a 403 problem.
How the jury will weigh all this information is up to
the jury. But it passes the threshold test to allow us to
elicit this information, particularly when — which is clear
now, your Honor — the defense is going to argue, probably at
closing, that everything was fine here because this investment
was a way to take down the CCP. They can cross
Ms. Schottenheimer on her lack of credentials, and the jury
will assess what weight, if any, to assign to
Ms. Schottenheimer's understanding of this financial product.



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
But as an employee of Hayman, who markets this product
for a living and has worked there for 25 years, her
understanding of what this financial product does is relevant,
is admissible, and the jury should be allowed to consider it.
THE COURT: So any individual who's hawking a
financial product you're saying can give an opinion about the
effect of the product on a given economy?
MR. FINKEL: So, your Honor, maybe. I'm not talking
about every financial expert or every financial product or
whatever. But in this case, I think, yes, I think
Ms. Schottenheimer is entitled to do that. Because she has
personal knowledge of the facts at issue. Given what their
defense is, it's clearly relevant. We don't need --
THE COURT: I'm not asking about relevancy. I'm
asking whether or not this witness is qualified to offer the
opinion.
MR. FINKEL: So she is under Rule 701. It's a 701
opinion, right, because it's based on her percipient
information, her percipient knowledge.
It would be no different, for example, than someone
who's a lay witness talking about, for example, slang terms
that they've experienced and used. One could also put on a 702
expert to testify about their understanding of terms that they
don't use. But if a witness has a perception that -- has an
opinion rationally based on their perception, which is what



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
Ms. Schottenheimer has, it qualifies under 701. And the
financial products here, itself, Ms. Schottenheimer has
knowledge of.
THE COURT: All right. So I'm going to allow you to
brief this this evening. And you'll come back -- what time is
it? So I want the government's brief by 8 and the defense
brief by 10.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, that's totally fine. We'll
do that.
If I can just ask the Court to inquire whether part of
the defense is Mr. Guo believing that an investment in the Hong
Kong Opportunities Fund is a way to take down the CCP.
THE COURT: I'm sorry. I thought it was later than it
is. I think I should make that earlier. One second.
I'll have the government's papers due at 6 and then
the defense papers at 8.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, your Honor.
And just in the context of the Court's consideration
and part of the government's arguments, can the Court inquire
of the defense whether one argument they may make is that
Mr. Guo believed that an investment in the Hong Kong
Opportunities Prodigious Series of $100 million was a way to
fight the Chinese government or the Chinese economy or the CCP.
THE COURT: So are you anticipating making that
argument?



O5UVGUO4 Schottenheimer - Direct
MR. KAMARAJU: I'm certainly reserving the right to
make that argument, your Honor.
THE COURT: I can't compel them to divulge their
defense.
MR. FINKEL: Understood. As long as the government
knows so they can respond that it very well may be an argument
made at closing, and it will assimilate that into its briefing.
Thank you, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: Your Honor, I know we'll address this
in briefing, but just since 701 is brought up, just to complete
the citation of 701, 701 also says that the proffered lay
opinion needs to be helpful to the understanding --
THE COURT: I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
MR. KAMARAJU: 701, if you continue reading it past
the provision that Mr. Finkel read, says that the testimony
also has to be helpful to clearly understanding the witness's
testimony and not based on scientific, technical, or other
specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702. There is
no universe in which a witness could testify that a particular
economic strategy would destroy a global economy without some
form of specialized knowledge.
THE COURT: Well, I am eager to hear from you.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
