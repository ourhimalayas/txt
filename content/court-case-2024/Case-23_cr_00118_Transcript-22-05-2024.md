Would the Court like me to double-check, confirming
everyone is in their proper seat?
THE COURT: No. I think that your colleagues have
done a fantastic job of that.
THE LAW CLERK: Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT: Good morning.
THE JURORS: Good morning.
THE COURT: My name is Analisa Torres. I am the judge
who will be handling this case. We're here this morning to
select a jury in a criminal case. The case is called United
States v. Miles Guo. Through this process, we will choose the
12 jurors and six alternates who will hear and decide the case.
The trial is expected to last about seven weeks, but
it is impossible to predict the exact length of the trial with
certainty.
Today, you'll be required to be here until 5 p.m. We
will be taking a lunch break. If we do not finish selecting a
jury today, you'll be required to be here tomorrow from 9 a.m.
sharp to 5 p.m.
After jury selection, our schedule will be as follows.
Please listen carefully. When jury selection is completed, our
schedule will be as follows: You'll be required to be in the
courtroom from 9:30 until 2:45 p.m., with a break from 11:30 to
12 p.m.



This jury selection process is intended to make sure
that we have a jury of citizens who will decide the issues in
this case fairly and impartially, and without any bias or
prejudice in favor of or against either side. In order to do
that, I'm going to ask certain questions about your personal
background, your family, some of your beliefs and attitudes
about certain matters, how you are employed, and so forth. You
should understand that my questioning is not intended to pry
into your lives, but to make sure that we select fair and
impartial jurors——that is, jurors who will be free from
preconceived notions or prejudice that might prevent them from
returning a fair and just verdict, based solely on the evidence
or the lack of evidence.
If for any reason you're not able to serve as a fair
and impartial juror, it is your duty to tell me.
In responding to my questions, it is important that
you not say in open court anything about the parties in this
case or about any other matter that might tend to impair the
open-mindedness and fairness of the other jurors. If a
question calls for a yes answer, simply answer yes or no. If
there are further matters that you believe should be disclosed
but that might tend to influence the other jurors, you may ask
to approach the bench to discuss them.
If you're selected to serve, you'll be provided light
refreshments in the morning and a light snack during the lunch



break each day.
As I said, this is a criminal case. The defendant,
Miles Guo, has been charged with committing 12 federal crimes,
in a document called an indictment. The indictment itself is
not evidence. It simply contains the charges that the
government is required to prove to the satisfaction of the jury
beyond a reasonable doubt. I will instruct the jury on what
this burden of proof means after the evidence is presented.
The defendant has denied the charges and has pleaded
not guilty. I have no knowledge of the facts, and nothing that
I say is evidence. I will, however, briefly discuss the
charges so that you'll understand the reason for certain
questions that will be put to you and so that we can determine
whether there is anything about the charges that would make it
impossible for you to serve as a fair and impartial juror. Of
course, those of you selected to sit on this jury will receive
a detailed explanation of the charges at the conclusion of the
case.
Before I start asking questions, I will explain why
each of you has been assigned a number and will be called by
your number only. This case will be tried before a partially
anonymous jury. That means that neither your names nor the
names of the jurors who ultimately are selected will be made
public. I, court administrators, the defendant, defense
counsel, the prosecution, and my law clerks will know your



names, but this information will not be shared with the public.
Jurors who are ultimately selected can share their names with
each other, but in open court no juror will ever be referenced
by their name. This case has attracted media attention, and
that is likely to continue. The purpose of using a partially
anonymous jury is to protect all of you from any unwanted
attention and invasion of your privacy, and to ensure that
nothing transpires that might interfere with your impartial and
objective study of the evidence and the application of the law.
I'm now going to tell you briefly about the charges in
this case. The indictment consists of 12 charges, or counts.
The government alleges that the defendant operated four
fraudulent investment schemes as part of a criminal enterprise.
The term "criminal enterprise" is also referred to as a
racketeering or RICO enterprise.
Count One charges the defendant with conspiracy to
operate a criminal enterprise.
Counts Two, Three, and Four charge the defendant with
conspiracy to commit wire fraud, bank fraud, securities fraud,
and money laundering offenses.
Counts Five and Six charge the defendant with
securities fraud and wire fraud, in connection with a private
stock offering for a media company known as GTV.
Counts Seven and Eight charge the defendant with wire
fraud and securities fraud in connection with loans made to a



group known as the Himalaya Farm Alliance.
Counts Nine and Ten charge the defendant with wire
fraud and securities fraud in connection with a lifestyle
membership company known as G Clubs.
Count Eleven charges the defendant with wire fraud in
connection with the Himalaya Exchange, which some have
described as a cryptocurrency ecosystem.
Finally, Count Twelve charges the defendant with
making a $100 million wire transfer using money derived from a
crime.
The defendant has pleaded not guilty and is presumed
innocent of these charges unless and until he is proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt under rules that I will describe as
we proceed. I have briefly discussed the charges, not for the
purpose of giving you any instructions but only so that you
will have them in mind as we go through jury selection.
I am now going to ask some questions to the entire
group. If you prefer not to give your answer in public, just
let me know, and the lawyers and I will hear you at the bench.
If you have a yes answer to any of the questions,
please raise your hand high so that I and my law clerks can see
you. Then I will either discuss your yes answer with you in
open court or ask you to come over to the sidebar and speak
with me and the attorneys in private. It is important that
each of you not discuss amongst yourselves any questions that I



ask.
After we have reviewed a number of general questions
together as a group, then I will ask each of you about your
individual backgrounds.
During the questioning, you might be excused from
serving as a juror in this case. If you happen to be one of
those excused, do not consider that as any reflection on you
personally. This is all part of our system of justice, which
is intended to provide a fair and impartial jury for both
sides. You will have done your duty by your presence and your
readiness to serve if chosen.
Do any of you have a problem with your hearing or
vision that would prevent you serving as a juror?
Are any of you taking any medications or do you have
any health-related problems that would prevent you from serving
as a juror?
All right, then. If you'll step up, please.
(At the sidebar; juror present)
THE COURT: Hi, sir. What is your number?
JUROR: 25.
THE COURT: And if you'll tell me your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the issue?
JUROR: I get nervous, and there's no way I can do
this.



THE COURT: You feel that you could not serve as
because of this health issue?
JUROR: No. I have a doctor's note here.
THE COURT: Okay. Let me take a look at that.
The letter is from Allied Healthcare Physicians, PLLC,
signed by Effie Shilhan, underneath it says DNP-FNP, and in
parentheses, BC. I don't know what those letters stand for.
Do you?
JUROR: I don't know, no.
THE COURT: Okay. The letter is dated May 21st. It
says:
"To Whom It May Concern: XXXXXXXXXX has been under the
care of our office. He has a documented history of anxiety.
Additionally, he has a history of panic attacks for which he
has required medical treatment. Being chosen as a juror may
exacerbate his underlying anxiety and cause significant
distress. If you have any further questions or concerns,
please contact our office."
All right, sir. You may go back to your seat. I'm
going to give you this letter.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing
No. 25?
MR. FINKEL: Not from the government.
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us.



THE COURT: All right. Then he is excused.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello, ma'am. What is your number?
JUROR: 37.
THE COURT: Could you tell me your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: I feel like I'm——I have anxiety, started
having social anxiety when I was in high school. And I'm not
seeing a doctor right now 'cause I don't have health insurance,
and I'm just afraid that with the media attention, I feel
really paranoid and really——I'm sorry.
THE COURT: All right. So you feel that this is not
the right moment for you to serve as a juror because of your
health issues; is that right?
JUROR: Yes. I'm sorry.
THE COURT: All right. Thank you. You can step back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing
No. 37?
MR. FINKEL: Not from the government.
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Next juror present)



THE COURT: Hello there. What is your number?
JUROR: 36.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I'm a substitute teacher in Yonkers. So the
students hit me in the back two weeks ago. So I'm in treatment
right now, with medicine, and there are times I can't drive, so
I don't know if I can——if I have half an hour or an hour to——
THE COURT: So you're telling me that the medication
is too sedating in order for you to serve as a juror; is that
correct?
JUROR: That's correct.
THE COURT: All right, then. You can step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing
Juror No. 36?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense.
MR. FINKEL: Nor the government.
THE COURT: All righty.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 50.
THE COURT: And what is your name, please?



JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.

THE COURT: I'm sorry. I did not hear you.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: So I have a herniated disc on the right side,
sciatica, so I'm constantly in immense pain, so it's a
challenge for me to sit or even stand for any period of time.
So it would be challenging for me to sit for——
THE COURT: So you feel that the pain would distract
you from the trial?
JUROR: So whenever I'm in pain, it's hard for me to
focus because not only do I experience pain, I have tingling,
numbness, weakness in my right side. Right now I'm in physical
therapy, I'm on pain medication, but even with the pain
medication, it's challenging for me. So that's why I say——
THE COURT: Thank you for letting me know. You may
step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 50?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense.
MR. FINKEL: Nor the government.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 91.



THE COURT: Okay. If you can just step back just a
little bit so everybody can hear you.
And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: Yes, I have rheumatism, arthritis, so there
are days where I can't get up out of bed or move at all. Also,
I have blood pressure where I have to take the medicine every
day, and I'm constantly going to the bathroom about every five
or ten minutes or so. So I didn't take anything today 'cause I
knew I was coming down here, so sometimes I get lightheaded and
stuff like that, so——
THE COURT: So you feel that the conditions will
distract you from your service as a juror; is that correct?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: All right. Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Was that 90?
MR. KAMARAJU: 91.
MS. SHROFF: 91.
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 91?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Nor the government.
(Next juror present)



JUROR: Hi. I'm sorry. I'm breastfeeding and——
THE COURT: One moment, please. What is your number?
JUROR: 92.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX. I lost my voice.
THE COURT: And you're saying that you're now
breastfeeding and this is not the moment for you to sit in a
jury box; is that correct?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: You would need breaks in order to——
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: ——pump.
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Okay. Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing her?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Nor the government.
THE COURT: All right. No. 92 is excused.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. If you would tell me your
number.
JUROR: 97.
THE COURT: And your name.



JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.

THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: So my daughter is having surgery tomorrow, and
so I didn't know when I——I should have excused myself from jury
duty, but I——I thought it was like state court, where you go in
three days and then you're done, so I——but I can't be here
tomorrow, or next week.
THE COURT: Or next week.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: You want to take care of your daughter; is
that it?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All righty then. You may step back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 97?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number, please?
JUROR: 34.
THE COURT: And your name please?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have four herniated discs, I have an



Achilles operation, my knee operation, I can't——my——my body
just can't sit here and just, you know, I can't——
THE COURT: So you feel that these health problems
would——
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: ——prevent you from serving as a juror; is
that it?
JUROR: Yes, mm-hmm.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing
No. 44?
MR. KAMARAJU: We do not object, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 93.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is your full name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I'm diabetic, so I——I take medication, but it
sometimes makes me nervous, and I cannot sit for a long period
of time with an empty stomach.



THE COURT: So are you saying that the nervousness
would make you feel very uncomfortable serving as a juror?
JUROR: Not all the time but sometimes, yeah, it make
me like not——I have to take a rest.
THE COURT: Yeah. And you're saying that you need to
take breaks in order to eat; is that it?
JUROR: Yes, sometimes, yes.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing
No. 93?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.

(At sidebar)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What is your number?
JUROR: 52.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: The only scenario I want to disclose, I'm
currently wearing a heart monitor for palpitations, irregular
heartbeat. I'm supposed to be wearing this for the next two
weeks, and then consulting with my physician after that. I
only mention that since it may be seven weeks, I don't know if
I'm going to be seen prior to.
THE COURT: So you're wearing some sort of device
right now?
JUROR: Correct. Heart monitor.
THE COURT: And then is it that you have to go back to
the doctor in order to get the results from --
JUROR: Correct.
And then from there, decide the course of action,
whatever that may be.
THE COURT: Well, did they discuss with you what that
might be?
JUROR: Not yet. Not until we know what the results
are.



THE COURT: In other words, did they mention it's
likely you may have to take medication or you have to have
surgery?
JUROR: Medication possibly. They mentioned
medication possibly.
THE COURT: But they didn't talk about surgery.
JUROR: Not surgery, not that I'm aware of at this
point in time, no.
THE COURT: So do you feel that wearing the monitor is
going to prevent you from serving as a juror?
JUROR: No. Just the seven weeks, in case they need
to do any course of actions prior to.
THE COURT: Well, you've just said that they've only
discussed medication.
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: And many of us take medication on a daily
basis.
JUROR: Right.
THE COURT: Did they tell you that the medication was
going to somehow impair your --
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: -- cognition?
JUROR: No. Not at this point, no, not that I'm aware
of any of that. I just figured I'll disclose it so you're
aware of it.



THE COURT: All right then. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I don't think that he should be dismissed
for cause.
MR. FINKEL: Government agrees.
MR. KAMARAJU: We agree, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, what is your number?
JUROR: 87.
THE COURT: 87. And what is your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem, Mr. Tejada?
JUROR: I have a prostate problem. I'm going to be
interrupting you probably every few minutes. So I have an
appointment for today at 3:30 that I lose because I have to
come here. But I just want to let you know. It's in your
consideration, if you wanted me to stay, I don't know.
THE COURT: Are you saying that you have to use the
bathroom frequently?
JUROR: Frequently.
THE COURT: Like how frequently?
JUROR: Like, I don't know, probably every 10 to 15
minutes, something like that, you know.
THE COURT: Okay.



JUROR: So I have a surgery already in my prostate, so
I cannot contain. You know, like sometimes I have to -- you
know, but I just want to let you know. Up to you.
THE COURT: All right, then, sir. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection with my excusing
him from service?
MR. KAMARAJU: No.
MS. MURRAY: 87. Not from the government, your Honor.
THE COURT: All righty.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 30.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: My doctor has me in physical therapy twice a
week for complications after multiple orthopedic surgeries. So
seven weeks of not having that for pain management would mean
medications and I'd rather not be on medication.
THE COURT: Are you saying that in order to serve as a
juror you would have to forgo the medication?
JUROR: No, I'm not on medication. Physical therapy.
THE COURT: It's only physical therapy that you're



receiving, but you need to receive it several times a week, is
that it?
JUROR: Twice a week.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: So like missing a week or two is one thing,
but seven weeks would be just -- for pain management I'd have
to go on some medications.
THE COURT: Are you saying that would be the
alternative, medication would be the alternative?
JUROR: I would have to go on multiple medications to
manage the symptoms.
THE COURT: And would that interfere with your ability
to serve as a juror?
JUROR: I would probably be out of it with the pain
management ones because the last time I was on them, I wasn't
fully there.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing number 30?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Defer to the Court, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello.
JUROR: How are you?



THE COURT: Fine. And you?
JUROR: Good.
THE COURT: What is your number?
JUROR: 35.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: Okay, then. And what is the problem?
JUROR: Twofold. I'm supposed to start therapy on my
right knee right after Memorial Day. And then I have cataract
surgery planned for mid June.
THE COURT: Okay. Well, good luck with all of that.
Would you tell me your number one more time.
JUROR: Sure. 35.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty. So you may step back.
JUROR: Thank you, Judge.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing
number 35?
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. Your number?
JUROR: 83.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: (redacted); F, as in Frank.



THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have Parkinson's disease. And I didn't find
an excuse for it, because I think I can serve; it just seemed
that I need to take medication every three or four hours, and I
thought you should know.
THE COURT: So would the medication interfere with
your ability to focus and stay alert?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: So it's just a question of your having a
break to take the medication?
JUROR: Yes, and possibly some abnormal movement at
times. I'm well-medicated. I'm not a severe case. I thought
about would I get sleepy, I don't think so. So I'm not baiting
to be excused. It would be your decision.
THE COURT: All right. Thank you. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So I see no reason to excuse number 83.
MR. FINKEL: We agree.
MR. KAMARAJU: We agree, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello, what is your number?
JUROR: 59.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?



JUROR: I just suffer from anxiety. Going to a
therapist once a month and I take medication twice a day. So
just the thought of -- I don't know. I just get anxious, so --
THE COURT: So are you saying that serving as a juror
is going to make your condition worse?
JUROR: Correct. Correct.
I also traveled extensively for my job; so two months
is like -- I can't even imagine that. It would just impact me
financially.
THE COURT: So it would be a financial hardship?
JUROR: Absolutely.
THE COURT: All righty, sir. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing number 59?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: We defer, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. Go ahead.
Is that it? All right. We'll go back.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Do any of you have any trouble
understanding or reading English?
All righty. If you would come up please.
Counsel.

(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 20.
THE COURT: 20. And what is your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I can speak, but I don't understand everything
and writing. So I don't want to be a judgment in something
that I don't understand everything.
THE COURT: Have you understood everything that I've
been saying?
JUROR: Yeah. Not everything, but I get it.
THE COURT: You're saying you've understood most of
what I said.
JUROR: Yeah. I can defend myself speaking, not
writing or understanding. I want to be honest.
THE COURT: Thank you.
JUROR: You know?
THE COURT: You can step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing number 20?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.



THE COURT: Okay.
(In open court)
THE COURT: If a witness testifies in another language
that you know, and an interpreter translates the testimony,
would any of you not be able to rely exclusively on the
interpreter's translation of the testimony?
Step up, please.
(At sidebar)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Would you come closer.
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: And what is your number?
JUROR: 19.
THE COURT: And do you speak another language?
JUROR: I speak a few, yeah.
THE COURT: And what languages are those?
JUROR: Russian, Dutch, German, Afrikaans and Hebrew.
THE COURT: All righty. So my question was whether if
someone is a witness and speaking one of these languages that
you know, other than English, and an interpreter is
interpreting, could you rely exclusively on the interpretation
given by the interpreter?
JUROR: I probably could, but I'm not likely to do
that. Because especially when it comes to technical terms that
I understand, perhaps that have not been interpreted correctly,



I think I'll attribute certain importance to my understanding
of the direct testimony that I heard.
THE COURT: So you're saying you would favor your own
understanding.
JUROR: Absolutely. I'm not going to disregard it.
But to the extent it's not interpreted in a way that makes
sense in my understanding, I'll just attribute -- I'll just
interpret it in context, irrespective of the technical
interpretation, especially when it comes to securities fraud.
THE COURT: So suppose I told you that you must accept
the interpretation offered by the interpreter. Would you be
able to follow that instruction?
JUROR: 100 percent.
THE COURT: So you would be able to put aside your
understanding of the language?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Do you speak Mandarin?
JUROR: I do not.
THE COURT: Okay. If you would step back, please.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So I think he was rehabilitated.
Is there any objection that is remaining?
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: Not from us.
THE COURT: All right then.



(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello, sir. What is your number?
JUROR: 80.
THE COURT: Number 80?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. One moment, please.
And if you would tell me your name.
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: Do you speak another language?
JUROR: I'm Italian.
THE COURT: And do you know any language in addition
to Italian?
JUROR: Italian, English, and a little bit of Spanish.
THE COURT: So if a person testifies at the trial
through an interpreter, would you be able to follow the
interpreter's translation exclusively?
JUROR: There are a lot of euphemisms in Italian that
can't really be translated; so it would be difficult for me to
disregard my knowledge of the language and culture when
someone -- things like that.
THE COURT: So if I told you that I don't expect any
Italian-speaking witnesses --
JUROR: Then it should be fine.
THE COURT: And if there are no -- let's talk about
Spanish. Do you feel the same way about Spanish as you do



about Italian?
JUROR: I'm definitely less knowledgeable, but I do
know certain phrases that are not really translatable, and it's
more about cultural significance to them.
THE COURT: So if someone were to testify in Spanish —
and let's say that you didn't agree with the translation
offered by the interpreter — would you be able to follow --
JUROR: It would be difficult, but I could try.
THE COURT: Okay.
Are there any other languages that you know?
JUROR: That's it.
THE COURT: Do you know Mandarin?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)^
THE COURT: Is there any objection to his remaining?
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, as long as he can follow the
Court's instructions to listen to the interpreter and not the
witnesses, there's no objection from the government.
THE COURT: We're not expecting any Italians or
Spanish-speaking people?
MS. MURRAY: We do have Italian and Spanish-speaking
witnesses, but they are expected to testify in English.
There's just a standby interpreter, particularly for the
Spanish-speaking witnesses, in case they need help with



technical terms.
THE COURT: So is there any objection to his
remaining?
MR. FINKEL: No.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, could we just have one
second?
THE COURT: Yes.
(Counsel conferred)
MS. SHROFF: Thank you, your Honor.
We have no objection.
THE COURT: Any other languages that you expect?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
THE COURT: His number was?
MS. SHROFF: 80.
THE COURT: Okay. So he'll remain. Very good.
Oh, we have one other?
THE LAW CLERK: Two more.
THE COURT: Two others?
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, what is your number?
JUROR: 95.
THE COURT: And I had asked -- and your name, by the
way.
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And I had asked whether anybody knows



another language; and if they do and a witness testifies
through an interpreter, if they could follow the interpreter's
translation exclusively.
JUROR: If the defendant or whoever is speaking
different language, in my specific case would be Korean, then I
would be understanding that language as well, whatever is
speaking. Then I will be naturally considering that as I
understand the language.
THE COURT: Other than Korean, is there any other
language that you know?
JUROR: No, I don't.
THE COURT: Obviously English.
JUROR: Yes, English, of course.
THE COURT: Assuming that it's not Korean, you would
be able to follow my instruction that you must rely on the
interpreter's translation; is that correct?
JUROR: Yes, that's right.
THE COURT: All righty. Thank you.
You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No Korean language speakers, right?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not that we're aware of.
THE COURT: No reason to excuse him.
THE LAW CLERK: We have one more after this.
THE COURT: After this one. Two?



(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 56.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And I had asked whether if someone
testifies in another language other than English, and if you
happen to know that language, would you be able to rely
exclusively on the translation that is offered by the
interpreter?
JUROR: I'm trying to understand the question, that's
why I stood in line.
So somebody talks in language that I understand, but
there's a translator, will I be able to rely on the translator
or on the person who testifies in the language that I know?
THE COURT: So if I instruct you that you must rely on
the interpreter, despite the fact that you know the language --
JUROR: I see.
THE COURT: -- would you be able to do that?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay.
And what languages other than English do you know?
JUROR: Russian.
THE COURT: Okay. So you don't know Spanish?
JUROR: No.



THE COURT: Not Italian?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Not Mandarin?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I see no reason to excuse her.
MR. FINKEL: The government agrees.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello there. What number are you?
Okay. 53. And what is your name.
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And your last name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: Do you know any languages other than
English?
JUROR: Yes. Czech, Slovak, Polish, Russian, German
little bit, little bit Spanish.
THE COURT: So if someone testifies in Spanish through
an interpreter, would you be able to rely on the translation
offered by the interpreter instead of your own knowledge of
Spanish?
JUROR: My main concern is I work with interpreters
and I'm really concerned that using the interpreters, I know



how the nuances are often lost. And when I use the interpreter
and someone else uses -- asking similar questions, the nuances
are sometimes different. And the answers of the person that
you're talking with might be different. And I use the
interpreter on a daily basis; so I kind of have the experience
that asking questions with the interpreter, somebody else ask
similar questions and get different answers. Because sometimes
the nuances are lost.
THE COURT: So are you saying that you do not have
faith?
JUROR: Well, for basics, yes; but for details, no.
THE COURT: And so if you were a juror and the
interpreter was interpreting in a language that you do not
know, then would you --
JUROR: Well, that's -- I don't know, because I would
not be able to totally rely on that. Because I know that
sometimes things could be missed with this.
THE COURT: Okay.
And you are number 53; is that correct?
JUROR: 53.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing her?
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.



MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor. Thank you.
THE LAW CLERK: That's it, Judge.
THE COURT: That's it?
Okay. Let's go back.
(In open court)
THE COURT: The trial in this case is estimated to
last about seven weeks; that is, approximately until July 12th
of this year. We will not be in session on federal holidays,
nor will court be in session on the following days:
Monday, May 27th; Wednesday, June 19th; Friday, June
28th; Monday, July 1st; Thursday, July 4th; and Friday, July
5th. I'm just going to repeat those dates. We will not be in
session on Monday, May 27th; Wednesday, June 19th; Friday, June
28th; Monday, July 1st; Thursday, July 4th; and Friday, July
5th.
Keeping in mind your civic duty to serve as a juror,
is there anything about the length of the trial that would make
it an extreme hardship for you to serve as a juror?
(At sidebar)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, what is your number?
JUROR: Number one.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: What's the problem?



JUROR: I have a small business, and this would cause
me a great deal of harm. I was explaining to the person up
front when I came in that I was -- you know, even for a short
trial, it would be detrimental to me.
THE COURT: You're saying it would be a financial
hardship?
JUROR: I mean, in every way: To my business, to
financial. Yeah, I'm all but a one man band. I have just one
other person working with me and I'm over my head.
THE COURT: All right then. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing him?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)^
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: Seven.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I'm an HR director for the Department of
Education. So right now -- we just had the budget. And right
now we're staffing. And I have to make sure that there's
summer school and staffing for September.
So a lot of my directors are calling me. I should



have been in a meeting today. I wasn't aware that I couldn't
bring my computer, because I didn't know. So I thought I was
going to be able to do some work here. Apparently, I cannot
use my computer.
THE COURT: What would happen, God forbid, if you were
hit by a truck today?
JUROR: Right. They would have somebody there to
cover for me, you're right.
THE COURT: So there are other people who can perform
your work?
JUROR: Yeah. But, like, seven weeks is a long time.
And we just -- I just -- we just hired a new HRD who I was
training; and she's the one that I was training for this role.
She's new. I'm in district one and two, she's in district two.
She just got there. And I was supporting her. And now I'm not
there. So I told her to, like, you know, make sure she can
take some of my calls. And when I get back to the office, I'm
going to, you know, address some of the issues.
THE COURT: Is she the person who would fill in if you
were completely unavailable?
JUROR: Yeah. She just started. Yes, she's my cover
right now. She's covering for me right now that I'm here.
THE COURT: Did you hire her?
JUROR: We hired her, yes, the committee.
THE COURT: So everyone thought she was very



competent; is that right?
JUROR: Yes, that's correct.
THE COURT: Okay. So it could be that she could
perform the job maybe with some difficulty?
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: All right. You can step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I don't see any reason to excuse No. 7.
MR. FINKEL: Government agrees.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, I think that -- I honestly --
she's not going to be -- it's going to come back is that she
clearly says this is the school period where the time slot is
the most necessary for her presence. And I just think that
given her -- given what she said, eventually we're going to
have the same problem with her. Because unfortunately, it's
the break, it's the school break these months, these weeks. So
our position would be we should excuse her for cause, but
that's our position.
THE COURT: Okay. So I disagree. She said that she
has someone who is new, but who would take over if she were
completely unavailable. So I'm not going to excuse No. 7.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello, sir. Would you tell me your
number.



JUROR: No. 6.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: Seven weeks is a long time. I have a
single-income household and I work a lot of overtime to keep up
with the bills. I also have my son's graduation, vacation
plans. And the boys also play baseball, so a lot of
tournaments.
THE COURT: So will you be paid if you serve as a
juror? Is your salary going to continue?
JUROR: Oh, yes, I'd be paid. But also I'm not
working the overtime. That's always available to me.
THE COURT: So what portion of your income would you
be losing?
JUROR: At least 30 percent.
THE COURT: And would that be a financial hardship for
you and your family?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All right. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing No.
6?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense.
MR. FINKEL: We defer to your Honor's judgment.



THE COURT: All righty. No. 6 is excused.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: Nine.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: Well, I have an eight-year-old, and my husband
and I watch him. We work hybrid schedules, and we're going to
have a problem with daycare and he's going to need to take off.
And he might lose his job because we don't have someone to
watch our son.
THE COURT: So you know that we're meeting only
between 9:30 and 2:45?
JUROR: I understand that.
THE COURT: Isn't that generally the time when your
son would be in school or at camp?
JUROR: So I live in northern Westchester. It would
take me an hour and a half to get there. There are days when
he has off that are not holidays. The school is just closed.
And he's heading into camp. And the camp hours are different.
They end at 4. And I don't know if we'll be there to pick him
up or if it's going to be challenging.
THE COURT: So you feel that the schedule -- your
son's schedule will not permit you to be here between 9:30 and



2:45, is that it?
JUROR: That's correct.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing her?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, no.
I just note that obviously everyone is going to have a
problem sitting on the jury for a trial this long. And I defer
to your Honor's judgment about the amount of hardship with this
particular juror. And more generally, that's the government's
concern.
THE COURT: Well, I'm asking you if you're objecting.
MR. FINKEL: Not objecting.
THE COURT: You're not objecting.
What was that number again?
MS. SHROFF: Nine.
THE COURT: All right. No. 9 is excused. Let's go.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 13.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?



JUROR: I have -- I'm a maid of honor at a wedding out
of town on June 27th. So if it can go until June 27th, that's
great, just after July --
THE COURT: So when would you have to leave then?
JUROR: The 27th.
THE COURT: You'd have to leave on the 27th. And when
would you be returning?
JUROR: July 9th.
THE COURT: So that period between the 27th and the
9th --
JUROR: It's on the west coast.
THE COURT: -- you must be away.
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: All right, then. You may step back.
(Juror not present)^
MS. SHROFF: I think we should keep her; I need the
break.
THE COURT: I think that won't work, so I'm going to
excuse No. 13. No objection; correct?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us.
MR. FINKEL: Correct.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. Your number?
JUROR: 12.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?



JUROR: So I'm head of investor relations. I don't
know the company -- if I can -- head of investor relations for
the Middleby Corporation. And I have four investor events that
are coming up that require me to be at, because we already had
the meetings arranged to meet with investors, the hotels have
been booked, and so that's within the next month.
THE COURT: So when are those meetings?
JUROR: I have one next Thursday, I have one June 6th,
and the other one is -- I think is right -- no, June 10th, and
there's one a week before that, so I think it's like June 3rd
or so.
THE COURT: So what would happen if you were hit by a
truck?
JUROR: Well, I mean, the meetings would be canceled.
But my fear is that if this doesn't happen, I mean, I could
lose my job, honestly.
THE COURT: So are you saying that there's no one at
your investment firm that could --
JUROR: It's not an investment firm, it's a company.
So I'm head of investor relations; so I'm meeting with
investors at these conferences.
THE COURT: So you're looking for them to make some
sort of equity contribution, is that it?
JUROR: Not necessarily, but maybe buy the stock.
THE COURT: Buy the stock, okay.



JUROR: Right.
THE COURT: And so if you could not be there to
cultivate those relationships, who would go in your stead?
JUROR: CFO maybe.
THE COURT: The CFO could go.
JUROR: Maybe.
THE COURT: All right. Okay.
All righty. You may step back, sir.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So I don't see any reason to excuse him.
MR. FINKEL: Government agrees.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, the first answer he gave was
if you couldn't go, what would happen, he said, I would have to
cancel the meeting.
THE COURT: Right. But then he just said the CFO can
step in.
MS. SHROFF: I understand that he said maybe the CFO
could step in. And then he said it would be an immense
financial hardship.
THE COURT: I didn't hear the financial hardship
piece.
MR. SCHIRICK: I thought he said, your Honor, he would
lose his job.
MS. SHROFF: He said he would lose his job. I'm
sorry.



THE COURT: Let's bring him back.
What number was he, by the way?
MR. FINKEL: 12.
THE LAW CLERK: 12.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, you said that you might lose your
job. Why is that?
JUROR: I feel that because that -- I feel if I don't
go to these events because I'm the one that arranged them, I
have the meetings already arranged, maybe someone could step in
for me, but I would get a sense that -- that they would feel --
that almost like a letdown in a way somewhat.
THE COURT: So you're saying -- are these the
higher-ups, people that are senior?
JUROR: Yeah. The CEO, CFO, yeah. It would be
because it would put them in a bind as well.
THE COURT: And those meetings can't be rescheduled?
JUROR: No, no. Because the event is set and the
meetings are set. And so they are not -- it's an event that we
don't arrange, that's arranged by a bank or banks. And these
meetings are already set, so there's no way to move them.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Well, it sounds like he has less control
over the process than I originally thought.



MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, appears to work for a company
large enough to have a C-suite, including a chief financial
officer and chief executive officer. The trial, as the Court
noted, will end every day at 2:45.
Everyone is going to be putting their jobs to the side
and fulfilling their civic duty and sitting on a jury in this
case. They would be able to help and communicate with the
people that he works with in the investment firm after a trial
day. I don't believe that what he has said is reason to excuse
him for cause at this time.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, he specifically said the
meetings are out of town. He said his flight is booked and his
hotels are booked. It's not one meeting, it's several
meetings. Meetings don't occur after 3:45 on a workday;
meetings occur during the day.
He specifically said he didn't arrange these meetings.
These are conferences that were set up by banks and other
people. And he's the person who has liaised with the people
that are planning to be there for him.
So I do not think this is an issue of civic duty of
putting things aside; this is a person who has detailed why
he's asking to be excused. I think that there is a genuine
concern on his part that he's letting down the people that
hired him. And for those reasons, we should not treat him any
differently than any other people who have asked to -- I wasn't



finished.
THE COURT: I'm sorry. Go ahead.
MS. SHROFF: No, no, I was -- I mean, he said he's --
he detailed -- we didn't even ask him where he's supposed to
travel to. So he has travel and hotels booked for himself.
And he's the one who's the person who liaised with the client.
THE COURT: So he did say that the CFO would step in.
I'm not going to excuse him.
Anybody else?
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Juror number please?
JUROR: 18.
THE COURT: And what is the issue?
I'm sorry, your name again.
JUROR: (redacted).
MR. FINKEL: Sorry, 18? Thank you.
JUROR: So I have travel plans. I am taking my
grandmother home to Denmark on the 28th of June.
THE COURT: That's wonderful.
Okay. All righty. Enjoy your grandmother.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: All right. We'll excuse No. 18.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello, your number, please?



JUROR: 17.

THE COURT: And your name please?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: Tomorrow I have a major job interview that
I've been working towards for over a year with my company that
I work for. I also have a funeral for my grandpa in June, and
I'll be traveling for around two weeks.
THE COURT: So is this a memorial service?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And so when is that? What day is that?
JUROR: It's from around June 15th to the end of June.
THE COURT: All right. But there's one service, isn't
there?
JUROR: Yeah, but it's in Sweden, so I have to travel
to Sweden.
THE COURT: I see. All righty.
If you'll step back.
(Juror not present)
MR. KAMARAJU: Consecutive jurors who travel to
Sweden?
THE COURT: Denmark. It's a Norwegian day, I guess.
MR. KAMARAJU: Are we going to have Norwegian speakers
at the trial?
MR. FINKEL: I don't think so.



THE COURT: What number is he again?
MS. SHROFF: 17.
THE COURT: He's excused.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What is your number?
JUROR: 25.
THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.
JUROR: I own my own business with one other employee.
So being away for seven weeks would be quite a bit for me to be
away from because it's only me and her. I also have prepaid
travel plans already starting June 14th.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: And my dad is also 82, and I have to take care
of him as well.
THE COURT: All right. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: He's already excused.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: If you would just tell me your number,
please.
JUROR: Sorry. No. 26.
THE COURT: Your name, please.
JUROR: My name is (redacted).
So I was just recently diagnosed with skin cancer. So
I had an operation about nine days ago. I didn't think it was



going to be a big deal, but there's no way I can sit through
seven weeks. I have to go back and forth. So it's -- sitting
through seven weeks, I have follow-up appointments. I mean,
it's skin cancer. They think they got most of it, but there's
just no way I can sit through seven weeks with a skin cancer
diagnosis.
THE COURT: So is it that you need to go to the
doctors' appointments?
JUROR: Yeah, I have doctors' appointments,
follow-ups.
THE COURT: Okay. So if you had these appointments in
the afternoon, after we finish --
JUROR: Psychologically, I mean, I was just
recently -- this is something that came out of nowhere. So a
week ago Monday I went and I had skin cancer, carcinoma. They
removed a big gash here in my leg. So I'm still dealing with
that. To be coming down here for seven weeks on top of
everything else, I just don't think I can handle that.
THE COURT: Are you saying that you would be
distracted by your medical condition?
JUROR: I would be distracted by my medical condition,
yes. I'm still trying to get over it, but --
THE COURT: All right, sir. I hope you feel better.
You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.



(Juror not present)
THE COURT: All righty. Number?
MS. SHROFF: 26.
THE COURT: All right. He is excused, I assume
without objection.
MR. KAMARAJU: None from us, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. Sorry about that.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 24.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I'm currently on a project that I'm overseeing
that I need to bring to completion during this time for my job.
I don't control the schedule of this project.
In addition, I've been working on the project for over
a year. If I don't see the project to completion, I don't get
paid at all because I have a deferred salary.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR:  (redacted).
THE COURT: What is the nature of the project?
JUROR: It's a film production.
THE COURT: And there's a deadline?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And what's that deadline?



JUROR: Well, I need -- we have to picture lock the
film by July 4th; quickly then I move into the sound mix for
the following two weeks. So between now and July 4th, I need
to be involved on a daily basis on this project. I need to be
present in screenings; I need to be present for the entire
sound mix. It's not a possibility for me to change this.
THE COURT: What is your title?
JUROR: I am producer.
THE COURT: And is this a feature film?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: So if you got hit by a car, what would
happen?
JUROR: They would replace me. I wouldn't get paid.
I would be dead. They would replace me.
THE COURT: So you're saying that if you're not
present, it would be a financial hardship.
JUROR: Yes. I'd lose over $100,000 in deferred
salary from this film if I don't -- if I do not bring the film
to completion.
THE COURT: Your number again?
JUROR: 24.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No objection to his being excused?
MR. KAMARAJU: No.



MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
THE LAW CLERK: Judge, 22 so far.
THE COURT: Oh, okay. We're good.
MR. KAMARAJU: Always an optimist, your Honor.
THE COURT: That is right. That is right.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. Your number, please.
JUROR: 38.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: What's the last name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: So I'm graduating within the next two weeks.
So I really would rather not miss my graduation. And after
that, my parents will work full-time, and I'm one of the
caretakers for my ten-year old sister. And I need to be there
to, like, pick her up from school and make sure that she's fed
and such.
THE COURT: And so what degree are you going to get?
JUROR: A bachelor's.
THE COURT: Bachelor's. And when is the graduation?
JUROR: It's next week. And the ceremony is after to
celebrate awards and such.
THE COURT: And are you saying that you care for your



sister 100 percent, there's no other person that they can rely
on?
JUROR: There are other -- I have another family
member who can, but it's -- she's still -- she's young, she's
not -- she's still younger, she's 19 years old. And I don't
want that burden to be entirely on her.
THE COURT: So what is the date of the graduation?
JUROR: May 28th.
THE COURT: May 28th.
And then you say there's something else that you have
to go to?
JUROR: That is optional. I can probably work around
that. But mostly it's just making sure I make it to that, and
then just taking care of my sister.
THE COURT: So if you are able to go to the graduation
on May 28th, then your commitments to the school would be
satisfied; is that correct?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And then you say that there's someone else
who can take care of your sister, although it's not preferable,
is that what you're telling me?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All right, then. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)



THE COURT: All right. Are we off on the 28th?
MS. MURRAY: No, that's next Tuesday.
MS. SHROFF: I made the same mistake. I was all
excited.
THE COURT: All right. So what do you want to do?
MS. SHROFF: You know, let her go to her awards
ceremony. We're in good shape with numbers.
MR. FINKEL: Graduation is important.
THE COURT: All right, then. 38, was it?
All right. No. 38 is excused.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 37.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: So basically, like, I'm door-knocking for a
political candidate. And the primary is on the 25th. And
whether she wins or loses, I might be out of a job.
And on top of that, if it's, like, eight to ten weeks
for pay and the trial is seven weeks, I'm not going to have any
money coming in. And I won't be able to pay my credit card or
pay for my cat's health, like the cat insurance.
THE COURT: So you're saying this would be a financial
hardship for you?
JUROR: A really bad one.
THE COURT: All right.



JUROR: There's one more thing I need to raise.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: I don't want to sound mean or anything, but
when I heard that the defendant does like crypto stuff, I'm
kind of like really opposed to any crypto stuff at all. I kind
of think they are nontrustworthy. They run scams. I would be
really biased. I don't think I can move past it at all. I've
heard a lot about things that happen with these, I'm sorry.
THE COURT: No, that's all right.
All right. I appreciate your candor.
You can step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: We've already excused her.
MR. KAMARAJU: We don't have an objection.
MR. FINKEL: To excusing her again? Neither do we.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What is your number? 39?
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: Okay. What is your name?
JUROR: My name is (redacted).
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I have a ten-year old who I am solely
responsible for getting to and from school every day. My
spouse works overnights till 8 a.m., and sleeps during the day.



Once school ends, I'm it. I'm his summer camp until August,
when his actual summer camp starts. We don't have family in
the area. A lot of people have family help; we don't have
that. I live in northern Westchester. It took me two hours to
get here. I'm all my kid has until August. Also, we have a
family vacation planned the week of 4th of July on top of all
that.
THE COURT: All righty.
JUROR: So that's it.
THE COURT: Thank you for letting me know.
JUROR: And I'm a nervous wreck now not having my cell
phone. I'm his emergency contact as well.
THE COURT: All right. I understand.
You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No. 39, is there any objection to my
excusing No. 39?
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 41.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: Well, I have an immediate scheduling issue.



I'm scheduled to fly out of New York to San Francisco for a
conference on Tuesday afternoon. And I'm not planning to
return from California until June 8th.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: My name (redacted).
THE COURT: And why do you need to go to the
conference?
JUROR: It's a caregiver conference and it's part of
my -- I'm the CEO of a small company, and I was invited to
attend the conference.
THE COURT: So is it something that you're required to
do?
JUROR: I'm not required, but it would require a lot
of moving around to change it.
I also have a ticket -- confirmed ticket, which is
nonrefundable, to leave the country on June 21st and not
returning until July 1st.
THE COURT: And where are you going?
JUROR: To Ireland.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: And then just the last thing is that I run a
small company. I'm CEO. We have six employees. And so, you
know, I can be gone for a little bit, but to be out without any
communication during the day, during working hours for that
long would definitely be problematic.



THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing her?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Was that 41?
MS. SHROFF: Yes.
THE COURT: All right, then.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there.
If you'll tell me your number, please.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: 23. And your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: My father is in Hospice, he's 97. I'm his
only child and primary caretaker for him. I came because I
thought I would probably have to serve for two weeks, but seven
weeks would not be possible. If something happens, I'm the
only one.
THE COURT: I'm sorry to hear about your dad.
All righty. Don't worry, you may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: She was?



MS. SHROFF: 23.

THE COURT: Okay. So she is excused without
objection; correct?
MR. FINKEL: Yes, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. If you'll tell me your number,
please.
JUROR: 21.
THE COURT: And your name.
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I'm going to be away next Thursday and Friday.
And I work in a hospital in their IT department, so it would be
hard for me to take off that much time.
THE COURT: And so what hospital do you work at?
JUROR: Montefiore.
THE COURT: So that's a big, big hospital with many,
many, many employees. And I imagine that you're not the only
IT person there; am I correct?
JUROR: No. No. I mean yes, sorry, you're correct.
THE COURT: Okay. So they would be able to find
somebody to fill in for you; is that correct?
JUROR: Yeah. I guess so.
THE COURT: And this going away that you talk about,



is that something that is obligatory?
JUROR: I mean, yeah. I have my flights booked. It's
for a bachelorette party.
THE COURT: Your flights are booked?
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing her?
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor. We're not going to
ruin her bachelorette party.
THE COURT: All right. So she was 21. Okay.
(Juror present)
JUROR: Hello again, your Honor.
THE COURT: Hi there. Your number again?
JUROR: 19.
THE COURT: And what's the issue?
JUROR: There are a few.
So I'm going on holiday on Friday with my family.
Then I'm going to Germany at the end of June through July the
2nd for a major international sports event. We bought the
tickets, bought the plane ticket, reserved hotels. It's an
expense of approximately 5K.
Certainly a seven-week absence from my job would be
extremely detrimental to my employer due to the fact that they
will need to quickly, through some sort of fire drill, delegate



authority, because currently I'm authorized to do certain
things. And quite a few affiliates in the U.S. and overseas
that, you know, other people are not authorized to do. And
incur legal fees in terms of expenses to substitute for my
presence there, that I would say -- I would estimate it to be,
for a seven-week period, something along the lines of 500,
600K.
THE COURT: What do you do?
JUROR: I'm a managing director and counsel at an
investment bank.
THE COURT: So you're an attorney?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Well, an investment bank can certainly
afford to find a substitute for you.
JUROR: I'm not saying that they couldn't. I'm just
saying they could find a substitute, but my team consists of
much more junior lawyers. And those lawyers are unable to
provide the same type of review and produce the same type of
documents without going to outside counsel. As I'm sure you
know, your Honor, outside counsel is quite expensive, since
we're talking about exalted products, derivatives, very
structured. It would cost them quite a lot.
So just to give you an idea, even if you need like a
memorandum, a legal memorandum, and hopefully the lawyers here
can attest to that, or just a summary or even a due diligence



questionnaire to produce in connection with a certain M&A
transaction, merger and acquisition transaction, your Honor,
just that would cost like around 250, 300K.
THE COURT: So you also mentioned that you have an
event abroad; is that correct?
JUROR: Yeah, it's the Europe 2024 event, your Honor.
THE COURT: Did you buy your tickets already?
JUROR: I did. I did.
THE COURT: All righty. You can step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No. 19.
Is there any objection to my excusing him?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: We don't object, your Honor.
Just to note it's possible that the trial is completed
by that point. It's possible, to the extent someone's travel
or someone's reason for being excused is because they maybe are
going away, for example, for July 4th, to the extent we're not,
that would be, from the government's perspective, a good time
for an alternate juror to step in.
So we don't object to this particular juror; I just
wanted to note that as we move forward.
THE COURT: Understood.
No. 19 is excused.



(Juror present at sidebar)
THE COURT: What is your number?
JUROR: 42.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: Yeah, so I——just for context, I work in the
financial——for a financial technology company. I have to do
travel for that company, specifically over a week during the
middle of this period, which is going to be very hard to get
out of that trip because that's visiting one of our largest
customers. So that's the primary issue.
THE COURT: What is your role at the firm?
JUROR: I'm a sales leader, so I work with some of our
largest customers, and it's critical that I meet with those
customers. We have some scheduled meetings already set up on
the West Coast, and if I don't attend those meetings, it's
going to cause some hardship for my team.
THE COURT: So if you were hit by a truck and other
people at the firm needed to fill in for you, couldn't these
meetings take place?
JUROR: I presume, yes.
THE COURT: Okay. So you're not completely
indispensable.
JUROR: I don't think anybody is.



THE COURT: Okay. Is there anything else you wanted
to say?
JUROR: Specific to——
THE COURT: My question, the question that I posed.
Sounds like you have nothing further to say, so you
can step back. Thank you.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: He was No.?
MS. SHROFF: 42.
THE COURT: I see no reason to excuse him.
MR. FINKEL: No objection.
MR. KAMARAJU: No objection.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 32.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: So I work with the NBA, and right now it's
post season, and we tend to travel for our finals and playoffs,
and right after that I'm going to have a medical procedure
during the down time, so——
THE COURT: And when is that scheduled for?
JUROR: It hasn't been scheduled yet because——I don't



want to get too detailed, but it's basically IVF, and that
basically turns on, like, how your follicles are growing, so
I'm going to try to start the procedure right when I get back
from traveling from finals, and then it could last anywhere
from three to four weeks, the procedure.
THE COURT: So are you saying that you have scheduled
it during this time because——
JUROR: Because my——because once the season ends, I
have about two or three months to kind of get everything in
order before the season begins again, September.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing her?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay. So that's No. 32.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What number are you?
JUROR: 31.
THE COURT: And your name, please?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have two young children. I've organized
child care for the next two weeks after 5:00. I don't have it



available to me after that time. It's just——I won't be able to
make it work with the numbers.
THE COURT: All righty. You can step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 31?
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What number are you?
JUROR: 33.
THE COURT: And?
JUROR: Mine is, 24th through 27th, I have my cousin
coming in from the UK for a prepaid vacation, and I need
time——I need like a day to see if she can move it without any
penalties.
THE COURT: You're saying that you could contact her——
JUROR: If I have my phone, though.
THE COURT: During the lunch break you could try to
get ahold of her and see whether she can change her schedule.
JUROR: Well, can we move it. I might need till
tomorrow morning. Yes. That's when——
THE COURT: You're saying maybe by tomorrow morning
you would have an answer?
JUROR: Yes, yes.



THE COURT: But it might even be sooner than that?
JUROR: If I can get my phone. 'Cause she's over in
London, so we've got the time change difference, so I just need
to know can she push it and are there any penalties associated
with it. Is that all right?
THE COURT: Okay. So you'll make that inquiry and
you'll come back to me.
JUROR: I will. Yes, I will.
THE COURT: All right. Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE LAW CLERK: Next one?
THE COURT: Yes.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What number are you?
JUROR: 43.
THE COURT: Say again?
JUROR: 43.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I'm a single mom. I have two children. I
have no financial help or no one to help me with them, so I
need to work.
THE COURT: Are you saying it would be a financial
hardship for you to——



JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: ——be a juror?
JUROR: Yes. I have something else, but I don't know
if you want me to tell you now or wait.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: When I was growing up, my father was in
federal prison for 20 years for some of the similar crimes, tax
evasion, insurance fraud.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. Thank you for telling
us. All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing
No. 43?
MR. KAMARAJU: We'd love to keep her, your Honor, but
no.
THE COURT: Okay. Okay.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What's your number?
JUROR: 45.
THE COURT: And what's your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I've got three kids at home——a 2-year-old, a
4-year-old, and a 9-year-old——and my husband and I being their
primary caregivers, like, have coordinated our schedules to



cover them, and then also the school calendar, and it doesn't
help that.
THE COURT: Understood. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 45?
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 58.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I'm a physical therapist, and we're extremely
short staffed where I live, and ultimately my patients just
won't be able to get serviced for care for the next seven
weeks.
THE COURT: So who do you work for?
JUROR: Ivy Rehab.
THE COURT: And where is that?
JUROR: We have 600 locations, but I work in
Westchester, in the Harrison location.
THE COURT: So if you were hit by a truck, what would
happen?
JUROR: We would have——we would have an even longer



wait list to get in for physical therapy, and patients,
unfortunately, would be in pain.
THE COURT: So essentially your exclusive concern is
the fact that you're short staffed.
JUROR: Mm-hmm.
THE COURT: Is that a yes?
JUROR: Yes. Sorry.
THE COURT: But if the facility was adequately
staffed, you would have no problem serving.
JUROR: Yeah, absolutely. I believe in servicing the
community in which I operate. This is what I wake up and do
every day.
THE COURT: You my step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I don't see a reason to dismiss her.
MR. FINKEL: The government agrees.
MS. SHROFF: Honestly, your Honor, I can't tell the
difference between her or somebody else who couldn't be here
because they had child care issues. It's the same thing. I
mean——
THE COURT: No. You have an obligation to take care
of your children, and if your children aren't taken care of,
there's a safety concern there. But this is about somebody who
has a broken ankle and can't get the physical therapy within
the time period that they desire. They may have to go to a



different physical therapist.
Okay. Let's have the next person.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What's your number?
JUROR: 60, your Honor.
THE COURT: 60?
JUROR: 60.
THE COURT: Your name, please?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I just graduated with my master's in software
engineering and I'm job searching, and I'm worried that the
time spent here would delay my finding a role at a company. So
the process is pretty lengthy. It requires a couple hours, two
to four hours usually of technical——technical assessments for
interviews at these companies, and so for each one, that's a
significant amount of time, plus prepping for these
assessments, plus actually applying to the roles and writing
cover letters. It's really a full-time job.
THE COURT: So what would happen if you simply could
not devote yourself to that during this time period?
JUROR: Well, I'm worried that I won't be able to find
a position as summer openings happen and it will delay my entry
into the field.
THE COURT: And if that happens?



JUROR: I won't be able to move out of my parents'
house and go out and find an apartment, I won't be able to
start my career.
THE COURT: So this, you're saying, would disrupt your
plan to get a job within a certain time period and to move out
of your parents' house within a certain time period; is that
correct?
JUROR: Yes, ma'am.
THE COURT: All right. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I do not think that is a ground for cause
dismissal. Is there any disagreement?
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: No.
THE COURT: Okay. Let's get the next one.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What number are you?
JUROR: 27.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: So I have been unemployed since the end of
January. I'm just now starting up a new job. Seven weeks
leaves me seven weeks almost no money, not enough to pay my
bills. Financial hardship probably would be too much for me.



THE COURT: All right. So you'll step back. Thank
you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 27?
MR. KAMARAJU: No.
MR. FINKEL: No.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What is your number?
JUROR: 28.
THE COURT: 28. And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: It's going to cost me too much money to travel
for this.
THE COURT: Where do you live?
JUROR: Monsey.
THE COURT: So you're saying it's too expensive for
you.
JUROR: It's going to cost me a hundred dollars a day
traveling.
THE COURT: So what kind of transportation do you use,
sir?
JUROR: I take Monsey Trails, and then I get a taxi
here.
THE COURT: I'm sorry. I didn't understand. First



you take what?
JUROR: A local community bus.
THE COURT: So there are buses that come from Rockland
County to the Port Authority, and then you could take a train
from the Port Authority downtown.
JUROR: I won't be able to——I got to take——I got to
take a cab to the bus.
THE COURT: Okay. And——
JUROR: And then the bus and the train.
THE COURT: Okay. So you're saying that the cab fare
from your home to the bus station——
JUROR: And then the bus station——
THE COURT: You're saying that that's too expensive
for you.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Tell me your number again?
JUROR: 28.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back. You can step
back.
JUROR: Leave?
THE LAW CLERK: No, sir. Go back to your seat. Thank
you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing
No. 28?



MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: My number is 35.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I am a lawyer for the financial institution
AIG, and in all likelihood, on May 28th, it will be announced
that I get to retire, so that gives me between——that gives me
between May 28th and June 30 to clear out my docket, assign it
to other people, etc., etc. To not be here while I can do
that——June 30th will be my retirement date.
THE COURT: What is the nature of your work?
JUROR: I'm an in-house litigator.
THE COURT: And so if you were here as a juror, are
you saying that you would be distracted by this obligation to
clear out your docket?
JUROR: Yeah. I've got to assign——I've got to assign
the cases to other folks and I've got to close the matters that
I'm working on.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you, Judge.
(Juror not present)
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, I think you excused No. 35



before.
THE COURT: Yes. I forgot about that. Yeah.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What is your number?
JUROR: 53.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: Me and my husband are both from Czech
Republic, from Europe, and in June is my——end of June is my
father-in-law 80th birthday, and we were planning to visit, not
in June, but we're planning like early July. We don't have
yet, like, set-up date, but trying to coordinate with my
sister, with my sister-in-law, with my sister, with my——so
there's a lot of people that are involved, so we don't have the
set-up date, but we're planning early July, so——
THE COURT: All righty. Well, I hope you have a good
trip. You may step back.
JUROR: Yeah. Okay. The other——
THE COURT: It's fine. You can step back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What number are you?
JUROR: 54.
THE COURT: What is your name, sir?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?



JUROR: If I don't work, I don't get paid on my job.
THE COURT: What do you do?
JUROR: I work for New York Power Authority security,
in White Plains.
THE COURT: So are you saying that this would be a
financial hardship?
JUROR: Big financial, yeah, but, you know, a big
financial.
THE COURT: Understood. You can step back.
JUROR: Okay. Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 54?
MS. SHROFF: No.
MR. FINKEL: No.
THE COURT: Wow. Seems like the line keeps on
growing.
THE LAW CLERK: We only put the first couple rows and
then the next couple rows, so we still have——
THE COURT: How are we doing numberwise?
THE LAW CLERK: I'll have to check.
(Next juror present at sidebar)
THE COURT: What is your number?
JUROR: Oh, 51.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.



THE COURT: If you would say that louder.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: It's just really bad timing at work. I work
at an auction house and we have this big sale mid-July that if
I'm gone for the next seven weeks, I think it's going to be
really bad. I think they're going to get really mad at me.
THE COURT: What auction house do you work for?
JUROR: Phillips.
THE COURT: And if you were hit by a truck today,
somebody would be able to step into your role; isn't that true?
JUROR: Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm just——I know there's,
like, bigger problems, but it's just——there's——I think it
would——I think my boss would be really mad, and everyone else
too, but obviously, if it happens, it happens.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: All right. I don't see any reason to
excuse her.
THE LAW CLERK: The jury administrator wants to know
if and when we're breaking for lunch. There are apparently
some people who want to go out. We have 75 people downstairs
waiting.
THE COURT: Oh, the people downstairs can go.
(Next juror present)



THE COURT: Hi. What's your number?
JUROR: 66.
THE COURT: And what's your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have two issues. My work doesn't pay me for
the time off, and I can't afford to have seven weeks not
getting paid; and then I'm leaving for a two-week trip on
Friday.
THE COURT: So you're saying this would be a financial
hardship for you?
JUROR: Very much so, yes.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 66?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What's your number?
JUROR: 65.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: Oh, XXXXXXXXXX. I have a family vacation
already scheduled. It's July 4th and we return back
August 24th.
THE COURT: And do you have plane tickets?



JUROR: I can——when I have access to my phone, I can
forward them to you.
THE COURT: No. I'm saying you've scheduled the
flight.
JUROR: Yes, everything's been scheduled for.
THE COURT: All right. You can step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 65?
MR. FINKEL: The government objects. I think we'll be
done by July 4th, and if we're not, there will be an alternate.
MR. KAMARAJU: I don't think you can plan that way,
your Honor.
THE COURT: You gave me a certain time estimate, and
now you're kind of waffling, and so I don't feel comfortable.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, I'm not waffling. Yesterday
I told the Court that we believe we'd certainly be done by
July 4th. That's still our belief. The defense case is,
according to yesterday's information, approximately four days.
The government's case, as we said yesterday, is four to five
weeks, trending towards four weeks. We'll be done by July 4th.
If we're not——
THE COURT: Well, you can make a representation we're
going to get it done by July 4th, instead of the wishy washy.
MR. FINKEL: So that is my belief, your Honor.



THE COURT: Right. I need more than a belief in order
to make a schedule.
MR. KAMARAJU: Also, your Honor, we just told all
these people that it was going to be a seven-week trial.
THE COURT: No, that doesn't bother me. If he's now
willing to commit to being done by a certain day, then I have
the flexibility.
MR. FINKEL: So, your Honor, the only reason I can't
commit is because there are things outside my control——
THE COURT: Of course.
MR. FINKEL: ——including the defense case, the length
of cross. But if you're asking me for a good-faith
basis——good-faith estimate, does the government believe this
trial will be done by July 4th, yes, and to the extent it's
not, which I acknowledge is a possibility, the government's
view would be that at that point, if this juror makes it, an
alternate can take their place. So the government objects, but
of course understands it will be the Court's prerogative how to
proceed on this issue.
MR. KAMARAJU: We don't object.
THE COURT: You don't object.
MR. KAMARAJU: We don't object. We think the person
should be excused.
MS. SHROFF: I agree, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. I'm going to excuse that



individual. Have the next one step up.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 67.
THE COURT: What is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: So three things. I've got personal trips
coming up, including this weekend, I leave on Friday, come back
on Tuesday. I have a business trip the following week. And
then the week of July 4th I'm gone as well on a family
vacation.
THE COURT: So do you have tickets already purchased?
JUROR: Yes, yes.
THE COURT: All right, sir. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 67?
MR. KAMARAJU: No.
MR. FINKEL: No.
THE LAW CLERK: You've got like 40 excused.
THE COURT: All right. We're still good. We've got
another 75 downstairs.
MS. SHROFF: I renew my application to let No. 12 to
go to work. He was no different than anyone else. That poor
guy.



(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What is your number?
JUROR: 64.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: I don't find it a problem, but I just realized
how long you said it would be, and I'm diabetic, so I know I
have at least four doctor's appointments during that time. So
I don't know if that's an issue. Also——
THE COURT: So we're going to be ending every day at
2:45, and so that does leave you time at the end of the day to
get to a doctor.
JUROR: So I could just change appointments or
something like that.
THE COURT: Correct.
JUROR: Okay. One more thing. I'm going away this
weekend and I won't be back till Wednesday.
THE COURT: Is that something for which you purchased
tickets?
JUROR: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
THE COURT: Flight?
JUROR: No, not flight, hotel. And they're going
to——if I don't, you know——if I don't go, they're going to
charge me a cancellation fee.



THE COURT: I see. Okay.
JUROR: And it's only till Wednesday. So——
THE COURT: All right. You can step back.
JUROR: Okay. Thank you so much.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing her?
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 55.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is your last name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is your problem?
JUROR: So I work for a temp agency right now, so I
got lucky, they gave me a long-term assignment, but they don't
pay out, like, jury duty things. They max three days. So then
seven weeks is a lot. And then since I do customer service,
they need people on the phone, so I don't know if my assignment
is being reassigned to somebody else, and I don't know, like,
what am I going to come back to?
THE COURT: So are you saying that this would be a
financial hardship for you?



JUROR: Yeah. It's like I basically don't know if my
job is going to be there when I get back, 'cause, again, it's
like a temp agency, so——
THE COURT: Did you say 55 or 56?
JUROR: 55.
THE COURT: Okay, then. All right. You can step
back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No. 55, any objection to my excusing her?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 57.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: So the week of June 22nd I have a wedding in
Cyprus.
THE COURT: So you have purchased tickets for the
wedding?
JUROR: Yeah. Nonrefundable.
THE COURT: Okay. Well, bon voyage.
JUROR: Thank you.



THE COURT: Thank you. You may step back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
MR. KAMARAJU: Great travel plans.
THE COURT: No objection to my excusing her, correct?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 74.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I am going to Kabul, leaving tomorrow, coming
back Tuesday; and then the main one is the last week in June,
I'm going away with my family and my boyfriend's family, where
a certain question might be asked, knock on wood.
THE COURT: Oh. Understood. All righty. You may
step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
MR. KAMARAJU: Good luck with that.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: No objection to my excusing No. 74?
MR. KAMARAJU: None here, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No.



MR. KAMARAJU: My wife would kill me.
MS. SHROFF: You would regret that.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 72.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: I'm moving out of the state in the next month
to go to grad school.
THE COURT: Where are you going?
JUROR: I'm between Georgetown and Duke, but I'll know
next week.
THE COURT: Great.
JUROR: I just don't think I can commit seven weeks.
THE COURT: What are you going to study?
JUROR: Business.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 72?
MR. FINKEL: No.
MR. KAMARAJU: No.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 71.



THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: My name is XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I'm a self-employed physical therapist. It
would be extreme financial hardship——and I'm having to relocate
my business by July 1st, so it would put an end to my business
to serve now. I'm sorry.
THE COURT: All righty. Good luck.
JUROR: Thank you so much.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 71?
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. Your number, please?
JUROR: 63.
THE COURT: Your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: The problem is that I'm supposed to, I think
Thursday——that's the 28th of June——go away with my girlfriend,
and I was planning on actually proposing to her that week.
THE COURT: Oh.
JUROR: So it would be a pretty big bummer if I had to
change that.



THE COURT: Good luck to you.
JUROR: Thank you.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: All right. Then no objection to my
excusing No. 63.
THE LAW CLERK: Is his girlfriend in the jury venire?
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: I'm juror 62.
THE COURT: What is your name?
JUROR: First name XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: Your full name.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: So I know that our trial is seven weeks. I'm
getting married at the end of June. I also have——my fiancée is
pregnant with my firstborn. Her first doctor's appointment is
tomorrow. I work full-time as a registered nurse. And I see
that this is going to be seven weeks, and it's just not——I'm
already distressed that I'm already going through this, and
so——
THE COURT: Understood. Understood. You may step
back.
(Juror not present)



THE COURT: This makes me feel very optimistic.
No. 62, any objection to my excusing him?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Nor us, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number?
JUROR: 48.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I'm a New York City DOE teacher. I work with
students with disabilities, and I just feel like seven weeks
being away from them is going to hinder everything they've
learned so far this year and for the rest of the school year.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 48?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 61.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?



JUROR: I'm an independent contractor working in TV
production, and to do seven weeks would be really hard. With
the rerun strike last year, it's a hardship. And I have a job
starting up around June 10th. Seven weeks for us is a long
time.
THE COURT: This would be a financial hardship.
JUROR: Both financial and time. I'm a producer. I
hire the crews that go onto the films.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty. Thank you. You may
step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing 61?
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from us, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. Your number?
JUROR: 56.
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: So I'm a self-employed photographer, career.
I could serve. However, I have two trips planned, first week
of June and last week of July, overseas, work related.
THE COURT: Are you saying that you've already
purchased the tickets for that?
JUROR: Yes.



THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: The June, yes; not the July.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 56?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: And your number, please.
JUROR: 68.
THE COURT: 68. And your name.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have booked a family vacation June 5th,
Wednesday, until June 8th, Saturday, flight to Atlanta and
hotel room.
THE COURT: Already purchased.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All right, then. You can step back.
JUROR: What does that mean?
THE COURT: You can go back to your seat.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: All right. Any objection to my excusing
No. 68?



MR. FINKEL: Not from the government.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. So what I'd like to do is to
stop now and have them return so that we can continue at 2:00.
MR. FINKEL: Okay.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. Thank you, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT: It is now almost ten of 1.
ALL COUNSEL: Thank you, your Honor.
(In open court)
THE COURT: All right. So our work for the morning
has come to a close. You'll have to return to the courtroom or
rather to the hallway ready to come into the courtroom at
2 p.m. sharp. Some of you are going to be excused.
Mr. Steinberg is going to read the list of those who have been
excused. But the rest of you must return and be in the
hallway——not downstairs, not on the way to the courthouse, but
in the hallway by 2:00 ready to come back in.
One thing that you must be very conscientious about is
that you cannot discuss the case amongst yourselves or with
anyone else. Don't permit anyone to discuss the case in your
presence. The attorneys are not to have any contact with you.
So if you see them in the hallway or on the elevator, or
outside, and they don't look at you or they don't greet you,
it's not that they're being rude, it is that they simply are



not permitted to have any contact with you.
So have a good lunch. Mr. Steinberg will now read the
list of those who are excused.
THE LAW CLERK: The following people are excused and
do not need to return after lunch. Please also obtain your
jury card from Mr. Shrinath on your way out. He is in the blue
suit and just raised his hand.
So the following jurors are excused: No. 25, No. 30,
No. 35, No. 36, No. 37, No. 44, No. 50, No. 59, No. 87, No. 91,
No. 93, No. 97, No. 53, No. 20, No. 1, No. 6, No. 9, No. 13,
No. 17, No. 18, No. 26, No. 19, No. 21, No. 23, No. 24, No. 27,
No. 28, No. 31, No. 32, No. 38, No. 39, No. 41, No. 43, No. 45,
No. 54, No. 92, No. 93, No. 66, No. 65, No. 57, No. 55, No. 74,
No. 72, No. 71, No. 63, No. 62, No. 48, No. 61, No. 64, No. 56,
and No. 68.
Jurors who have been excused, please get your card.
Everyone else may leave for lunch and return to the hallway
after lunch. Thank you.
Please be ready to go at 2 p.m. sharp. Thank you.
After you get the card, you should give it to the jury
administrator where you assembled this morning downstairs. To
repeat, after you get your card, please bring it to the jury
room where you assembled downstairs this morning. Thank you
again for your service.
THE COURT: So we started with 100, we are down 51,



and we have another 75 downstairs. So I'm still optimistic
that we'll get our jury.
See you after lunch.
ALL COUNSEL: Thank you, your Honor.
(Luncheon recess)



A F T E R N O O N S E S S I O N

2:15 P.M.

(Venire present)
THE COURT: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome back.
For those of you who came on time and were ready to
walk into the courtroom at 2 p.m., thank you. For those of you
who are late, it's simply impossible to run a trial if I can't
depend upon you arriving promptly at the appointed time. So
please, please come on time; otherwise, everyone is waiting and
things are thrown off.
All right. Do any of you have any personal knowledge
of the charges in this case? Personal knowledge of the charges
in this case.
We are still not finished yet with the previous
question. So if you'll line them up, please.^
(At sidebar)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What's your number?
JUROR: 80, eight zero.
THE COURT: And your name please?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: I don't have the finance to do this for seven
weeks. I get paid by the hour.
THE COURT: So you're saying it would be a financial



hardship?
JUROR: I -- yeah. I don't think I have the money to
live, because I just graduated college, still paying student
loans. I couldn't do this seven straight weeks.
THE COURT: All righty. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing him?
MR. FINKEL: No.
THE COURT: Is that eight zero?
MR. FINKEL: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What's your number?
JUROR: 75.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: My sister is getting married in Philadelphia
on Friday. I'm supposed to walk her down the aisle.
I'm also an attorney. I have two court appearances
coming up next month, one in a case in California; another one
over here in Queens. I could probably get somebody else to
cover it, but another member of my department is actually on
the Trump jury, which is kind of unfortunate.
And then I have a vacation planned the last week in



June, the Jersey Shore. I could probably work that out. But
then we're booked -- my family is booked to travel to Italy the
following week.
THE COURT: And when do you leave for Italy?
JUROR: Saturday the 6th is it? Sorry, I don't have
my calendar on me. July 6th, I think.
THE COURT: And you have tickets already?
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. You can step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing him?
MR. FINKEL: No.
MR. SCHIRICK: No.
THE COURT: He was number?
MR. SCHIRICK: 75.
THE COURT: Okay.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What's your number?
JUROR: 76.
THE COURT: What's your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I have a planned family vacation on the 15th
of July.



THE COURT: The 15th of July?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: Okay. So we're only going through the
12th.
JUROR: It could extend, your Honor.
THE COURT: Excuse me?
JUROR: It could extend. You said it yourself before.
THE COURT: Yes. I feel more confident than I did in
the morning that it will only go until the 12th. So no problem
for you then.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: Very good. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I'm relying on you.
(Juror present)^
THE COURT: What is your number?
JUROR: 89.
THE COURT: 89?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: My name is (redacted).
THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: I have a work-related problem. I am a partner
at Kirkland & Ellis in the investment funds group. I'm really,
really under water with some deals right now. And I don't



think I'm in a position where I can be on a case for seven
weeks. I understand my civic duty; would be happy to come back
later this summer and do another trial. But I can't be in a
jury box for nine hours a day and then working 12 to 15 hours a
night for seven weeks. I can't do it. I wouldn't even be a
good juror.
THE COURT: So why wouldn't you be a good juror?
JUROR: Because I will be sleeping. I have an
unbelievable amount of work that I have to complete and I can't
do both at the same time. And I can't sub out my work.
THE COURT: Are you saying that you would be
distracted by your work obligations were you to serve as a
juror?
JUROR: Of course I would. And I also don't know that
I would have attention span, stamina, etc.
THE COURT: All righty. You can step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing her?
MR. SCHIRICK: None.
MR. FINKEL: No.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. Your number, sir?
JUROR: 95.
THE COURT: And your name again?



JUROR: (redacted).

THE COURT: What's the problem?
JUROR: So I work for a bank.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: And they don't have seven weeks of duration to
be able to serve as a jury duty. I think it's significantly
less than seven weeks.
THE COURT: Are you saying that they won't pay you?
JUROR: No, no. I check HR, check with HR. I think
the period that is allowed for jury duty is less than seven
weeks.
THE COURT: Okay. So there's a legal obligation to
serve as a juror no matter what your company might say.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: So my question for you is are they saying
they won't pay you?
JUROR: There is nothing about the pay. There's no
provision about the pay.
THE COURT: Okay. So they don't have a say in what
citizens' obligations are.
JUROR: Okay. And in addition, we just got examined
by Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and there are a lot of
objectives that we have to meet and a project. And it's a very
short duration right now, on top of all the other daily tasks
that I need to do. It goes by due dates.



THE COURT: What bank do you work for?
JUROR: I work for Mizuho.
THE COURT: And does Mizuho have other employees?
JUROR: Yes, they do. It's just that the department
I'm in has specific due dates. And it's -- it kind of makes it
a little bit difficult for me to be able to not be in it.
THE COURT: So what happens if you get hit by a truck
today?
JUROR: I'm just saying it's just going to be -- it's
going to be a lot of on my part, I think, so just that explain
my situation, that's all.
THE COURT: So what I'm getting at is if you were to
disappear today --
JUROR: Right.
THE COURT: -- the bank would find somebody else to do
your job; isn't that right?
JUROR: That's true.
THE COURT: Okay. So then okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I am not going to excuse him.
MR. SCHIRICK: No objection.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello.
JUROR: Good afternoon, ma'am.
THE COURT: Your number, please.



JUROR: 96.

THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: I'm an educator, high school. And I have a
caseload. And it's about the end of the school year, and I
have to tie up my relationships with my students before they go
on, and my other compliance issues I'm responsible for at the
school.
THE COURT: You say you have a caseload. What is your
title?
JUROR: I'm a therapist. So I'm working with students
all the time.
THE COURT: Are you in the public school system?
JUROR: Yes, public school system.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty.
If you'll step back, please.
JUROR: Thank you, ma'am.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 96?
MR. SCHIRICK: No.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello.
JUROR: How are you?



THE COURT: I'm well. How are you?
JUROR: I'm okay.
THE COURT: Would you tell me your number, please.
JUROR: 82.
THE COURT: 82? And your name, please.
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: What's the problem?
THE COURT: Yeah. You came to tell me something.
JUROR: Oh, okay. I am a nurse, okay. So it will be
very hard for me to lose seven weeks.
THE COURT: So are you saying because financially it
would be a hardship for you?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Would you be paid if you did not go to
work?
JUROR: No, I have to go to work.
THE COURT: Okay. All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing No.
82?
MR. SCHIRICK: No objection.
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What number are you?



JUROR: Juror 84.
THE COURT: And what's your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what's the problem?
JUROR: My employer, they only pay two weeks of jury
duty. So I'm afraid if I go to a seven weeks trial, I'm going
to have to get a pay cut of five weeks.
THE COURT: And so that would be a financial hardship
for you?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing her?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MR. SCHIRICK: No.
THE COURT: She was 84?
MS. MURRAY: Yes.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 85.
THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I'm self-employed. I have a doggie daycare.
I'm a dog trainer. So I live in Westchester. When I come



here, I have to close my business because I run it on my own.
So weekends and holidays are days that I'm free, but during the
week it's kind of hard for me to come.
And then the dates that you gave us, I do have dogs
that stay overnight, so I have to be home during the day
because I have no one to take them out. I have 15, 20 dogs
every day. And that's one of the reasons. If I have an
employer, then it's -- but I don't.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 85?
MR. SCHIRICK: No.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 86.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I take care of my niece when my sister is at
work.
THE COURT: I am sorry?
JUROR: I take care of my niece when my sister is at
work. It's financially hard for me to be out for seven weeks.
THE COURT: All righty. You can step back. Thank



you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing No. 86?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MR. SCHIRICK: No.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 98.
THE COURT: 98. And your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: Three things, actually.
I have a publication deadline. I'm submitting a
chapter for a book that's due in August; I have a five-hour
daily commute; and I've got a chronic eye condition that makes
it harder for me to read the more tired I get. And I think
commuting here, you know, every day for seven weeks is going to
be exhausting.
THE COURT: Where do you come from?
JUROR: I live in Putnam County.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is there any objection to my excusing No.
98?
MR. SCHIRICK: No objection.



MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello.
JUROR: Hi.
THE COURT: What's your number?
JUROR: My number is 99.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: Well, I am still working. I'm semi-retired.
And on Mondays, I open the office. If the holiday falls on a
Monday, then Tuesday I open the office. And the length of time
and the fact that maybe a Monday I might have to not be
available for work, it causes me financial difficulties. I'm
semi-retired, I'm 76 this year, and I need the money.
THE COURT: Got it. Okay. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you so much.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: All righty.
Any objection to my excusing No. 99?
MR. SCHIRICK: No objection.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 100.



THE COURT: And what is your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: I have work travel planned for the middle of
June where I'll be out of the state for a couple days. I also
have a family member's and a friend's bachelor party scheduled
for July within the time frame of the trial.
THE COURT: So is the bachelor party during the day?
JUROR: I'd be leaving in the middle of the week, yes,
before the trial would end.
THE COURT: Where would you go?
JUROR: Up to Saratoga, New York. And then we're
traveling -- middle of June would be out of state to Michigan
for a couple days during the week in the middle of the week.
THE COURT: What do you do for a living?
JUROR: I'm a civil engineer.
THE COURT: And do you work for a company?
JUROR: Yeah, I do consulting for HTR. It's a
consulting company based out of New York. And we have a
program that's nationwide which involves some travel that I've
been doing for the past couple years.
THE COURT: So if you get hit by a truck today, is
somebody else in the company going to be able to do your work?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Yes. Okay.



You said that the bachelor party is in Saratoga?
JUROR: Mm-hmm.
THE COURT: All right. So that's a very easy drive.
JUROR: Yes, but it would be, I guess, before the
trial would end.
THE COURT: What day of the week is the party?
JUROR: I'd be leaving on a Wednesday. It would be
July 10th I'd be leaving.
THE COURT: You're saying the party is on a Wednesday
as opposed to, say, a Friday or Saturday?
JUROR: Well, it's the whole weekend. I'm getting
there Wednesday night, the party's through the weekend,
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
THE COURT: There's something in addition to the
bachelor party?
JUROR: No, it's the entire weekend.
THE COURT: It's the entire weekend.
Okay. You can step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing him?
MR. SCHIRICK: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. No. 100 is excused.
(Juror present)



THE COURT: Hello.
JUROR: I was here before, No. 33.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: We can't move the vacation without significant
penalties.
THE COURT: All right. I understand.
JUROR: We tried.
THE COURT: Thank you. Thank you for making the
effort.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So No. 33, anybody object to my excusing
her?
MR. SCHIRICK: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)^
THE COURT: Hi. What number are you?
JUROR: No. 3.
THE COURT: No. 3. And what is your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: When I work with mentally and disabled
individuals, really it's for six weeks going to be
overwhelming. And I work at night, you know. And then plus I
don't have no kids of my own, but I assist with my family I
have to pick up from school. So I can't do it. It's going to



be hard.
THE COURT: So are you saying with regard to your job
that --
JUROR: The job is going to be overwhelming for eight
weeks.
THE COURT: Overwhelming in what sense?
JUROR: Because we already short. The staff is short.
The staff, we are short already.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: And then personally my family, I have to pick
up my nieces and nephews from school.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: Because I work in the night.
THE COURT: What time do you pick up the children?
JUROR: I work at night. One finish at 2 -- 3:45.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: What number was that?
MR. SCHIRICK: Three, I believe.
THE COURT: All right.
So any objection to my excusing No. 3?
MR. SCHIRICK: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. Your name?



JUROR: (redacted) No. 52.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: So my fear is being out of the field for work
for seven months -- seven weeks, forgive me. I train position
and operators to do cataract surgery. And the postponement of
seven weeks potentially, and my fear is I'm going to lose
business and I'll be out of a job. That's my fear.
THE COURT: So do you work for a company that gives
you a salary?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: And so are you saying they won't pay you
if you don't show up?
JUROR: What I'm saying is I don't know we're going to
have replacements for -- to provide support for these surgeons
to do the cataract surgery.
THE COURT: Who do you support, what institutions?
JUROR: ASCs and hospitals that do cataract surgeries,
such as me. And Gramercy. And we do cataract surgery there.
I provide support with the surgeons on there. If I'm not
there, they won't use our product; and I don't have any
replacement for me if I'm not there.
THE COURT: You're saying there's no one else who can
do your job?
JUROR: There's no one else in this territory that
would do my job. I cover New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware,



and New York City.
THE COURT: So if you get hit by a truck today, no
surgery?
JUROR: They won't use our product.
THE COURT: They'll use somebody else.
JUROR: They won't use our product.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing him?
MR. SCHIRICK: No objection.
MS. MURRAY: No.
THE COURT: He was number?
MS. MURRAY: 52.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. Your number, sir?
JUROR: 76. I was here before.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: The problem is I don't feel comfortable
between you telling me that you're going to finish on the 12th
and I have a flight on the 15th. I know you're super smart,
and I know that you have this whole case under control. But
the gap between the 12th and the 15 is very uncomfortable for
me, besides the financial strain that dragging this for more
than two or three weeks is going to take on my family.
THE COURT: So when you say financial strain, what do



you mean?
JUROR: Well, you guys pay 60 bucks an hour, and I'm
going to be not paid for my job.
THE COURT: You're saying you would have to forgo your
salary, you would not be paid while you are here?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Okay. So any objection to my excusing
him?
MR. SCHIRICK: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: And he's number?
MS. MURRAY: 76.
THE COURT: Okay. All righty.
Looks like that's it. Let's go back.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Does anyone have any personal knowledge of
the charges in this case?
All right. Please step up.
(At sidebar)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: What number are you?
JUROR: 12.



THE COURT: And what knowledge do you have about this
case?
JUROR: So I likely read it in The Wall Street Journal
that -- so the knowledge I have is that he was or had a strong
relationship with Steve Bannon. I think his ultimate goal was
to take down the communist regime in China. And that he
defrauded, I believe it was, a billion dollars or so from
investors or was, you know, alleged to have defrauded about a
billion dollars from investors. And that, you know, Steve
Bannon has a close relationship with Trump, so it was all in
the -- I guess The Wall Street Journal and the papers that I
read.
THE COURT: So many of us read The Wall Street
Journal.
JUROR: Right.
THE COURT: And it's not -- it doesn't surprise me
that you may have had heard about the case. And so the first
question is can you put aside what you have read and come into
the court with an open mind and listen to the testimony of the
witnesses, review any documentary evidence, follow my
instructions on the law, and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: I believe so, yes.
THE COURT: What do you mean you believe? This is a
yes-or-no question.
JUROR: Yes. Yes, I mean -- yes.



THE COURT: Yes?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. You also mentioned that the matter
had something to do with Steve Bannon. You mentioned the
former president.
JUROR: Right.
THE COURT: Does that have any bearing on your point
of view about this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: You don't have any biases for or against
Mr. Bannon or Mr. Trump?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I see no reason to excuse him.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What number are you?
JUROR: I am 40.
THE COURT: 40.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: That I have heard about the case before from
some friends in the nonprofit that I work in with the Himalayan



Farmers Network. Apparently there was some confusion between
the farmers alliance and the Himalayan Farmers Network. So I
had known about the case before.
THE COURT: And could you tell me a little bit about
the network.
JUROR: Sure. They grow orange-fleshed sweet
potatoes, which are a primary source of vitamin A, which
prevent childhood blindness, which is a big issue in Nepal and
the rest of the Himalayas.
THE COURT: Okay. So agriculture is unrelated to this
case.
JUROR: Understood.
THE COURT: They are two different, very different
subject matters.
JUROR: Understood.
THE COURT: So is there anything about the fact that
there may have been some confusion that would prevent you from
being a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: Probably.
THE COURT: Why?
JUROR: Because there are people who work very, very
hard to improve people's lives under the name of the Himalayan
Farmers Network. And we have someone with a very similar name
who steals from people, doesn't sit well with me.
THE COURT: So first of all, these are only charges.



JUROR: Understood.
THE COURT: We have seen no evidence thus far, and
Mr. Guo is presumed innocent.
JUROR: Understood.
THE COURT: And he cannot be found guilty until a
unanimous jury finds him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
So right now if we were to have a vote of the people
in this room, they would have to vote not guilty because of the
presumption of innocence and the burden on the prosecution.
So can you put aside whatever you may have heard about
the defendant or his activities, and come into the courtroom
with an open mind, listen to the testimony of the witnesses,
review the documentary evidence, follow my instructions on the
law, and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: I could try.
THE COURT: It's a yes-or-no question.
JUROR: And so I would say no.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: She was number?
MS. MURRAY: 40.
THE COURT: And I am going to excuse her.
MR. SCHIRICK: No objection.
MR. KAMARAJU: Just to make the record clear.



(Juror present)
THE COURT: Sir, your number?
JUROR: 42.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: (redacted).
THE COURT: And what is the issue?
JUROR: So on a professional level, and there's part
on a personal level.
On a professional level, I've been involved in
financial technology companies, including the Chinese company,
over the past 20-plus years. My current company also is
involved in crypto.
So on a personal level, I've been investing in crypto
space for the past eight years; it's sort of a family-related
business now. And just in terms of the content of the case and
my ability to be impartial, I have concerns.
THE COURT: So cryptocurrency has become very popular
among Americans — actually globally.
JUROR: Yup.
THE COURT: And so why would you have these concerns?
JUROR: Yeah. So, I mean, I know about a lot of
compliance-money-laundering-related issues that have happened
both on a professional level and on a personal level. I feel
like I'm too close to what's been going on in this space over
the last almost decade for me to be able to judge the facts in



an impartial way.
THE COURT: So numbers of people have knowledge about
cryptocurrency and other financial matters. And the question
is can you put aside your knowledge and come into the court
with an open mind and listen to the witness testimony and
review the documents, follow my instructions on the law, and be
a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: And your question is?
THE COURT: My question was can you put aside your
knowledge about the subject matter and your feelings about the
subject matter, and come into the court with an open mind and
listen to the witness testimony, review the documentary
evidence, follow my instructions on the law, and be a fair and
impartial juror?
JUROR: Honestly, no.
THE COURT: All righty. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Was he 42?
MR. SCHIRICK: Correct.
THE COURT: All right. So I am going to dismiss him
for cause.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 47.
THE COURT: And your name, sir?



JUROR: (redacted).

THE COURT: And what is the issue?
JUROR: When I came into the room, I recognized the
man accused and one of the lawyers. I seen the case in the
news. And I don't have much details about the case, but that's
the knowledge I have from hearing the case in the news.
THE COURT: So this case has been in the news. So it
doesn't surprise me that you may have seen something or heard
something or read something.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: The question is, can you put aside
whatever you have heard or seen and come into the courtroom
with an open mind and listen to all the evidence in the case,
hear the witnesses, review the documentary evidence, follow my
instructions on the law, and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: So I work as an assistant property manager in
the city and -- building in Sutton Place in Midtown East. And
there's a lot of high-profile residents, diplomats, people from
all over the country.
And there have been certain scenarios of few residents
who have not paid rent on time because they either trying to
wire the money to America from their country and they use it as
an excuse not to pay rent.
I do have another case of residents where they have --
they're being sued for fraud and we are trying to evict them



because they haven't paid rent either.
So it would be hard for me to not take the case a
little bit personal, since I always involve into like those
residents or I have -- you know, going after those residents
for them to pay rent. So I don't know if I would be able to be
transparent or impartial.
THE COURT: So this is not a case where Mr. Guo is
accused of failing to pay rent.
JUROR: Right. I understand. Yeah.
But I do have residents who have been accused of fraud
and as a consequence of that. I've been involved in like their
not being able to pay rent. So I'm involved with -- very
familiar with lawyers in their cases trying to get them to pay
rent and leave.
THE COURT: And you can't put aside these particular
cases, your experience with these particular cases, and come
here with an open mind?
JUROR: I could, but it's something I do every day and
it's hard for me, like, not to judge the people that -- at
least the people live in my building. They are wealthy or the
high profiles. And there's always this money involved when it
comes to like, you know, get away with things sometimes. So --
THE COURT: Are you saying that you come in with a
negative feeling already toward Mr. Guo?
JUROR: Not personally to him, but to people who tend



to be rich or have high profiles.
THE COURT: But he is the only person here on trial.
It's not a trial against the class of rich people. And so the
question is can you look at him as an individual and be fair
and impartial to him?
JUROR: Not after what I see on TV.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: He's 47?
MS. MURRAY: Yes.
THE COURT: Any objection to my excusing him for
cause?
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
MR. SCHIRICK: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: That's it? Okay.



(In open court)
THE COURT: Is there anything about the nature of the
charges in this case that would prevent you from being a fair
and impartial juror?

THE COURT: YinYang Wang, also known as Aila.
Yongbing Zhang, Zachary Effting. Zhaoying Ye. Zhengqiao Du.
Do any of you know any of those people or have you or your
family members or close friends had any dealings directly or
indirectly with any of those people?
The witnesses in this case may include one or more of
what is known as an accomplice, or cooperating witness, a
person who has admitted to participating in crimes related to
the indictment, as well as other crimes. Is there anything
about the fact that cooperating witnesses may testify in this
case that would prevent you from being a fair and impartial
juror?
I will now read the names of potential businesses or
entities that may be mentioned during the trial. ACA Capital.
Armanino. Bank of Princeton. Bitgo. Brioni. Dallas
Lamborghini. Eastern Profit. Ferrari Beverly Hills. Freedom
Media Ventures. G Bank. G Clubs. G Coins. G Fashion. G
Mall. G Media. G Music. And G News. As well as Gettr,

any of your family members or close friends had any dealings

Sir, what is your number?
JUROR: 78, your Honor.
THE COURT: 78? And what is it?
JUROR: Which entity?



THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: Bank of Princeton.
THE COURT: What is your relationship to the Bank of
Princeton?
JUROR: I work for a separate bank, but there's
participation loans between the two banks.
THE COURT: You work for a bank and sometimes there
are participation loans——
JUROR: Well, there is a participation loan between
the two banks. I'm not aware of any other relation, but
there's a specific loan that I've been working on together with
Bank of Princeton.
THE COURT: So in the course of your work you deal
with a number of different entities; is that correct?
JUROR: Yes, yes. I work for a different bank, and
this is a participation loan with the Bank of Princeton.
THE COURT: Just the fact that you may have a business
relationship with the Bank of Princeton, is that going to
prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror if the Bank
of Princeton is mentioned in this trial?
JUROR: No. No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Do you think you can be completely
impartial if the Bank of Princeton comes up?
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Do you think you might have a bias in



favor of the Bank of Princeton because your business is doing
business with the Bank of Princeton?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Would you have a bias against the Bank of
Princeton because of that?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. You may be seated.
Anybody else?
Do any of you know or have any family members or close
friends had any dealings, directly or indirectly, with any of

entities, directly or indirectly?
I'm going to continue with my list.
Passione Rossa. Phaxis. Post Oak Motors.
Promemoria. RH Southeby's. Rule of Law Foundation. Rule of
Law Society. Strategic Vision. Taurus Management. Voice of
Guo. Voice of Good. Anybody know or have any family members
or friends who have had dealings, directly or indirectly, with
any of those entities?

relatives or close friends had any association or business
dealings with any member of the staff of United States
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (or SEC), or the Department of Homeland Security?
Have you, a family member——I'm sorry. Oh. What is
your number?
JUROR: 89.
THE COURT: And what have your dealings been?
JUROR: Oh, just there are a number of former SEC
employees that I work with directly on a daily basis. I don't
know if that counts.
THE COURT: All right. You may be seated.
JUROR: Thank you.



THE COURT: Have you, a family member, or close friend
ever been employed by any federal, state, or local law
enforcement agency, or the justice system? Oh, there's an
additional person over there. What is your number, please?
JUROR: Yes, your Honor. 98. The late Bill Pauley,
Judge Bill Pauley married me, six years ago.
THE COURT: He presided over your wedding.
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
JUROR: 75, your Honor. Formerly employed by the U.S.
Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia. It was
within law school though, so I wasn't employed, but I was trial
practice certified.
THE COURT: All right. Thank you.
JUROR: I'm No. 11. My sister works for the federal
government.
THE COURT: Your assistant?
JUROR: My sister.
THE COURT: Your sister.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And what does she do?
JUROR: She's an ALJ with the Department of Health and
Human Services, your Honor.
THE COURT: And is there anything about her job that
would prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror in this



case?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Considering that your sister is employed
by the federal government, would that cause you to side with
the government in this case?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Would it cause you to have a bias against
the government?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Would it cause you to side with the
defense?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Would it cause you to have a bias against
the defense?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Is there anything that would prevent you
from being a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Anyone else? What is your number?
JUROR: 95. My younger brother is a prosecutor in
Long Island.
THE COURT: In the state?
JUROR: In——I think he's in Mineola. I don't think it
is state. I'm not too sure on that one.
THE COURT: Is there anything about your relationship



with your brother or his work that would prevent you from being
a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: Not really.
THE COURT: Because your brother is a prosecutor,
would that cause you to side with the prosecution in this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you be against the prosecution?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Would you have a bias against the defense?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Would you be for the defense?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Anything that would prevent you from being
a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Anyone else?
JUROR: My daughter used to work at the New York City
Department of Investigation, in particular for the New York
Police Department, but she's now working for a different
department for the city.
THE COURT: So is your daughter a lawyer?
JUROR: No. Well, she does analysis for New York City
Department of——
THE COURT: And your number again, sir?
JUROR: No. 4.



THE COURT: Okay. So is there anything about your
daughter's work at any of those divisions that would prevent
you from being a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Considering that she works for the
government, would that make you side with the government in
this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you be against the government?
JUROR: No. I would be fair.
THE COURT: You would be fair. Okay. I'm asking you,
would you have a bias against the government?
JUROR: No, no.
THE COURT: Would you have a bias in favor of the
defense?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you have a bias against the defense?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Anything that would prevent you from being
a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Anybody else?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Your number, please.
JUROR: No. 15. My sister works for the U.S.



Department of State.
THE COURT: Okay. So considering that she works for
the federal government, is there anything about her job or your
relationship with her that would prevent you from being a fair
and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Would you favor the government because
your sister works for the government?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Would you be against the government?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Would you have a bias against the defense?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: A bias in favor of the defense?
JUROR: None.
THE COURT: Anything that would prevent you from being
a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Your number, please.
JUROR: No. 60, your Honor. My father was an
auxiliary police officer with the NYPD.
THE COURT: All righty. Is there anything about his
job that would prevent you from being a fair and impartial
juror in this case?
JUROR: I believe it may bias me towards the side of



the police department, if that was the question, ma'am.
THE COURT: So would you agree with me that in every
profession, there are those who are competent and who have
integrity and then there are those who are incompetent and who
lack integrity, in every profession?
JUROR: It depends on what we would describe as a
profession.
THE COURT: Every job. There are those that do their
job competently and with integrity and then there are those who
don't.
JUROR: There are jobs that are inherently bad or
immoral, in my opinion.
THE COURT: So let's just stick with being an
auxiliary police officer. Do you consider that to be a job
that can be characterized as a positive contribution to
society?
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: But would you agree that there are some
who take on that role who may not be good at it?
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: And there may be some who lack integrity
when they carry out their duties; is that correct?
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. So knowing that there are good
apples and bad apples, would you have a bias in favor of a law



enforcement official who is on the witness stand?
JUROR: I would think that the majority would be good,
so that seems to be a bias.
THE COURT: So you're saying you would give any law
enforcement witness the benefit of the doubt.
JUROR: Yes, ma'am.
THE COURT: Okay. You may be seated.
Who else?
JUROR: Juror 69. My daughter currently works for the
Connecticut State Court System as a court reporter, recorder.
THE COURT: She's a stenographer?
JUROR: No, recorder. So she has electronic means and
she sits in trials and records and transcribes.
THE COURT: In the same way that this very competent
individual is doing?
JUROR: Perhaps. It looks very similar.
THE COURT: All right. Okay. Is there anything about
her job that would prevent you from being a fair and impartial
juror in this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: And it would not interfere with your
ability to come into the courtroom with an open mind?
JUROR: No, it doesn't.
THE COURT: Okay, then. You may be seated.
Have you or any family member, individually or in the



course of business, ever been a party to any legal action or
dispute with the United States or any offices, departments,
agencies or employees of the United States, or have any
interest in any such legal action or dispute or its outcome?
Your number, sir?
JUROR: Juror 76. I do tax preparation. I constantly
fight with the IRS.
THE COURT: You can distinguish between the IRS and
other departments of the government, right?
JUROR: Certainly.
THE COURT: Okay. Anybody else?
Does anyone have any bias, prejudice, or other strong
feelings for or against United States Department of Justice,
United States Attorney's Office, or any law enforcement agency?
Have any of you read, heard, or seen anything in the
newspaper, on the internet, or on TV about this case? And I
address this question to those who have not already answered
the question. And in answering the question, I don't want you
to disclose the contents of what you may have heard.
JUROR: Okay. Juror 89. I've read some internet
articles about the case.
THE COURT: Okay. You may be seated.
JUROR: I wouldn't say that I——your Honor, juror 78.
I wouldn't say that I actually have——saw the details of the
case, but just standing outside, I heard associations about the



case, just loud, on the megaphone. I didn't know about it
before this morning, your Honor.
THE COURT: When you say standing outside, what do you
mean by that?
JUROR: With the megaphone, there was just
something——something comparing this to another case.
THE COURT: Are you saying that you exited the
courthouse and you heard something?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. And without stating what you
heard——
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: ——does that have any impact on your
ability to be a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: So you understand that here in the United
States we have freedom of speech.
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: And we can praise or criticize individuals
in public, right?
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: That's right. And so given that precious
freedom, that does not mean that what someone says is
necessarily going to influence you; is that correct?
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.



THE COURT: That's right.
Okay. Who else?
This trial will likely generate media attention. Will
each of you follow my instruction that you should absolutely
avoid reading, watching, or listening to media reports
concerning the case, including coverage of the case on social
media, like Facebook, Twitter, blogs, etc., until after the
case is over?
THE JURORS: Yes.
THE COURT: Is there anyone who cannot follow that
instruction?
Will each of you follow my instruction that you may
not research or talk about the case with other people until the
case is over?
THE JURORS: Yes.
THE COURT: Is there anyone who will not follow that
instruction?
As I mentioned, during the trial you will hear
evidence concerning alleged racketeering, an alleged
racketeering conspiracy involving wire fraud, securities fraud,
bank fraud, and money laundering. Will the nature of the
charges affect your ability to render a fair verdict?
Have you or anyone close to you been involved in any
proceedings involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission?



Have you or anyone close to you filed for bankruptcy
or been involved in a bankruptcy proceeding?
JUROR: Juror 79. My girlfriend is a restructuring
attorney.
THE COURT: Did you say your girlfriend is a
restructuring attorney?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: So your girlfriend is involved in
assisting clients who need to restructure their debt; is that
correct?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: And would that have any impact on your
ability to be a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Anybody else?
Do you or anyone close to you have strong views about
the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist party?
JUROR: Yes, your Honor. There's been a lot of news
about their treatment of the——I believe it's Uyghur people.
Also, the political situation with Taiwan is very concerning
for the future, as the situation with Hong Kong was a few years
ago.
THE COURT: Counsel, would you step up, please.
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: So I suspect that any number of people may



have strong feelings about the Chinese government or the CPC.
What line of questioning do you want me to pursue?
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, we would ask if people have
strong feelings, if they want to——I think it would be
appropriate to deal with those feelings at sidebar, since there
could be a wide range of things that could be relevant to the
trial or irrelevant to the trial. That would be government's
view.
THE COURT: So this individual, for example, what
would you want me to ask him? He said he's not happy with
Taiwan, he's not happy with the Uyghurs. What else?
MR. FINKEL: This individual I think should be struck
for cause because he has a bias in favor of law enforcement.
THE COURT: Yes, we know that already. But there may
be somebody who comes along who says something similar about
the Chinese.
MR. FINKEL: I think it should be explored and I think
that it should be asked of him whether what he's heard he can
put out of his mind so that he can focus on the evidence or
lack of evidence that is introduced at this trial, render a
fair and impartial verdict based on what he sees and hears at
this trial, and follow your instructions.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, I think every government
summation I've ever heard is, use your common sense, don't
leave it at the door. His common sense would include the bad



acts of the Communist Party of China, so I think it's kind of a
tight balance here asking somebody to set aside——so maybe,
before the person——actually, I think he's the only one who may
have raised his hand, so——
THE COURT: I'm not going to bring him up because
we've already decided——
MS. SHROFF: I don't know if there's anybody else.
THE COURT: I think there might be another person.
MS. SHROFF: Oh, there might be?
THE COURT: I'm just trying to understand what it is
that you want me to get at.
MR. KAMARAJU: Personally, I would just ask, whatever
their feelings are about the Chinese party, can you be fair and
impartial in this case, in the same way you would ask about any
other——
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, the government's concern is
that part of their defense I think is that Mr. Guo is fighting
against the Chinese Communist party, and if a juror may not
decide on the facts of this case and just decide that this is
an individual who's fighting against the Chinese Communist
party, they would be sympathetic to him, that would mean
someone who's not fair and impartial. That's what the
government's concern is.
MR. KAMARAJU: I think your Honor can address that by
asking, can you be fair and impartial.



THE COURT: I'm not going to bring up the defense.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, certainly not, your Honor. I would
simply say: Whatever your feelings are about the Chinese
Communist party, can you be fair and impartial about your
verdict in this case? That's all.
THE LAW CLERK: Judge, there's someone else who wants
to talk about the duration of trial. He just missed the
question.
THE COURT: Okay. So if you'll have him come up.
THE LAW CLERK: Judge, also, Juror No. 60, I think
he's already been struck.
(Juror present at sidebar)
THE COURT: Sir, what is your number?
JUROR: 73.
THE COURT: What's your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: Now I didn't go——I didn't go up here earlier
about the duration issue so I wanted to hear what, you know,
the case is about, like that, but now that I think this is
going to be a long trial and I'm a——I work in the finance at
Columbia University, and this is the end of the fiscal year and
I'm heavily involved with the closing. If the trial——
THE COURT: The closing of what?
JUROR: The books, accounting books. So if the trial



is going to be every day, that affects me.
THE COURT: But when you're away from your job at
Columbia, you're still receiving 100 percent of your salary,
aren't you?
JUROR: I do.
THE COURT: And if you got hit by a truck today,
they'd find someone else with your skills to fill in your
position; isn't that right?
JUROR: That's correct.
THE COURT: Okay. So you can be absent from your job.
JUROR: Okay. But what I'm saying is what I do right
now, in this situation, nobody does it except me.
THE COURT: Right. But that doesn't mean that someone
else——
JUROR: I know. Nobody is indispensable.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: Yes. I'm just saying my concern.
THE COURT: I understand you're saying that this may
be your specialty.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: I bet Columbia University has tremendous
resources and it can identify other people who may not be as
good as you are but who may approximate your skills and
talents.
All right. You may step back.



(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I'm not going to excuse him.
THE LAW CLERK: On 60, the conversation about the
police officer was while he's standing up over there, and I
think we had a conversation at sidebar.
THE COURT: So No. 60, the young man who was talking
about his father being an auxiliary police officer, do we agree
that he should be struck for cause?
MR. FINKEL: Yes, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Is there someone else responding to the
last question? Okay.
JUROR: Juror 81, your Honor.
THE COURT: What number is that?
JUROR: Juror 81.
THE COURT: Yes. Go ahead.
JUROR: I'm a member of the military reserves, and
they've been telling us about potential conflict with China,
but that's pretty much——
THE COURT: Okay. So I imagine that they must tell
you that we need to prepare to deal with any number of
different countries; isn't that correct?
JUROR: Yes.



THE COURT: Okay. So the fact that they may have
mentioned China, would that prevent you from being a fair and
impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Do you have any particularly strong
feelings about China?
JUROR: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. You may be seated.
You may hear testimony about or from former senior
members of the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon and
Peter Navarro. Do you have any strong views about advisors to
former president Donald Trump, including Steve Bannon and Peter
Navarro, that would prevent you from being a fair and impartial
juror in this case?
All right. Please step up.
(At the sidebar; juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What's your number?
JUROR: 11, your Honor.
THE COURT: What did you want to tell me?
JUROR: To be truthful, I don't trust them. I don't
trust Steve Bannon. Those are my——
THE COURT: So——
JUROR: Just in terms of what I've read in the news.
THE COURT: So there may be things in the news about
an individual that concern you, but we're not thinking about an



individual generally. It's only with respect to this case.
And so what a juror has to do is to come in with an open mind
and listen to the evidence in the case, listen to the
witnesses, review the documents, follow my instructions on the
law——
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: ——and not concern themselves with things
they've heard outside the courtroom.
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Can you do that and be a fair and
impartial juror?
JUROR: I don't think so, your Honor, to be very
honest.
THE COURT: Why not?
JUROR: I've just been following a lot of the news
over the past four years, and his beliefs are not my beliefs,
and that's pretty much how I feel about that, your Honor.
THE COURT: I understand that maybe his politics are
different from your own.
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: But the question is: Can you, knowing
that you disagree with him——you can disagree with a person,
right? I'm sure that you have family members or friends where
you strongly disagree with them.
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.



THE COURT: But does that make you unable to be fair
and impartial towards them?
JUROR: No, your Honor. I understand the question.
THE COURT: You can be fair and impartial in this
case?
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
MR. KAMARAJU: Your Honor, she's clearly struggling
with that answer. She said no initially. Obviously your Honor
brought up the family member analogy and that brought her
around, but she very clearly, from my perspective, said that
her feelings about Steve Bannon, who is going to come up in the
trial in connection with the businesses here, she doesn't trust
him, she doesn't think he's honest, so I don't think there's
any way that she should not be excused for cause.
MS. SHROFF: Also, your Honor, the fact pattern is
such that Steve Bannon is standing, according to the
government's evidence, next to Mr. Guo, making a political
announcement. If she actually said, I simply don't trust
Bannon, she's obviously going to——the obvious context is, it's
in the very context in which she doesn't trust him, and her
words were, "I don't think so, your Honor, to be honest." She
only came around because the link was to a family member, whom
you have to like whether or not you disagree or not. Family,



you're stuck with.
THE COURT: So what context do you understand that
Mr. Bannon is going to come up, if you feel comfortable telling
me that?
MS. SHROFF: I don't know. It's the government's
proof. They can——
THE COURT: I don't know. I don't know if you're
bringing him up. I don't know.
MS. SHROFF: No. The government is going to bring him
up, not us.
THE COURT: The only thing I know about Mr. Bannon and
Mr. Guo is that Mr. Bannon was arrested on his yacht. Is there
more to it than that?
MR. FINKEL: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.
MR. FINKEL: There's more to it than that. Just to be
transparent, of course, to the Court, the government views
Mr. Bannon as a co-conspirator in this case. What's at issue
here is whether or not this juror can be fair and impartial.
As defense counsel both pointed out earlier, everyone brings
their own sort of common sense and biases to any interaction
they have. And what matters, which is key for the Court, your
Honor, is when you asked her, can you be fair and impartial,
can you place what you know out of the courtroom outside of
your mind and base your decision only on the witnesses and the



evidence you hear in this case, and she said yes. So if they
want to strike her as a peremptory, they're free to do that.
MS. SHROFF: That's not what happened. She said, "No,
I don't think so, your Honor, to be honest." Then the Court
analogized and asked about the family structure. Then she let
out——and I wrote down on my card a big sigh, and she stopped.
So I do not think that that is correctly characterized.
THE COURT: Let's bring her back.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: I expect that Stephen Bannon will come up
in this case, and you expressed disagreement with his political
views.
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Knowing that he will come up in the case,
can you put aside your negative views toward him——I understand
that you have them, but put them aside and be a fair and
impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: You may step back.
(Juror not present)
MR. KAMARAJU: We renew our objection, your Honor.
MR. SCHIRICK: Only because I've been recently
reviewing some of the government's exhibits, one of the
government's summary exhibits that they plan to introduce very
early on for one of the early witnesses very prominently has



Steve Bannon on videos with his speaking by association with
Mr. Guo and the Rule of Law Foundation. So right up front
we're going to have to confront this issue where Mr. Bannon is
speaking essentially on behalf of the defendant.
THE COURT: Okay. Could you read back to me my
question and her answer.
(Record read)
THE COURT: All right. I believe that I have
rehabilitated her and so I am not going to dismiss her for
cause.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, Stephen Bannon isn't just
going to come up. The evidence that she's going to be
receiving is that Miles Guo and Stephen Bannon jointly put
forward a political movement, right, and she has said she
distrusts that. So at the very least could the Court ask her
that if there was evidence linking the defendant to Mr. Bannon,
would she still be fair and impartial towards the defendant,
while she's judging him? It's not a by line that Steve Bannon
is——the way the question comes up is, Steve Bannon's name will
come up. Sure, his name may come up. Then we wouldn't have
this argument. But he's closely aligned. There's a lot of
testimony that comes out about Steve Bannon here.
THE COURT: What I asked her to assume is that he is
involved in this case. That's what I said. And I'm
acknowledging that she has a bad impression of Stephen Bannon,



and she has said she can still be fair. I'm not going to
dismiss her for cause.
Could we have the next person.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. What is your number?
JUROR: 16.
THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the issue?
JUROR: I think I would find it difficult to be
impartial given that there might be Trump administration
individuals involved in the case.
THE COURT: So you feel that you have a bias for or
against people who are affiliated with Donald Trump?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: So if I told you that there are
individuals who are involved in the case who are associated
with Donald Trump, knowing that now, could you set aside
whatever your feelings are, good or bad, can you set them aside
and come into the court with an open mind, listen to the
evidence of the case, hear the witnesses, review the
documentary evidence, follow my instructions on the law, and be
a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: I could. I just don't know that I would
believe what they're saying is true. So even though I could



listen to your instructions and try to follow them, I don't
know that I would feel that I could trust the testimony they
gave as inherently true, just——
THE COURT: So I understand you to say that you have a
bias against people involved with Donald Trump; is that
correct?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: All right. I think that she should be
dismissed for cause.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
THE COURT: No. 16, is that correct?
MS. SHROFF: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right, then.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: No. 15.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: 15.
THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What's your last name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the issue?



JUROR: I'm not sure I can trust the testimony of
Steve Bannon.
THE COURT: So I'm not saying that he necessarily will
be testifying in this case. What I'm saying is that he will
come up. He is an involved individual. And so it sounds to
me, when you say that you cannot trust him, that you have a
negative viewpoint of him.
JUROR: I think he's a vile human being.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: Sorry.
THE COURT: Is that because of the political views
that he has expressed?
JUROR: No. It's more as a woman. I just find him to
be despicable.
THE COURT: Okay. I understand you have negative,
intensely negative feelings about him.
JUROR: Thank you for acknowledging that.
THE COURT: But the question is, can you, knowing that
you have these feelings, put them aside and come into the
courtroom with an open mind, listen to the witnesses testify,
review the documentary evidence, follow my instructions on the
law, and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: Yes, I do think I can do that.
THE COURT: Excellent. You can step back.
JUROR: Thank you.



(Juror not present)
MR. KAMARAJU: We're going to object. I understand
her answer, but just so I can make the record, she referred to
Steve Bannon as a "vile human being." Steve Bannon is the
reputed chairman of GTV and he's involved in the Rule of Law
Foundation. He's in a video with Mr. Guo. He's going to be
all over the case. And to have a juror who views him as, to
use her term, a "vile human being," regardless of her answer——
THE COURT: Would you feel the same if she said that
he was a saintly individual?
MR. KAMARAJU: Well, obviously I would take a
different perspective, but I think they would object, your
Honor, and on the same basis.
THE COURT: But an individual can be conscious of
their feelings, good or bad, and still set them aside. She has
said that she can set them aside. I do not believe she should
be dismissed for cause.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, maybe if you could just ask a
clarifying question whether or not she could judge Mr. Guo
fairly if she heard testimony that Mr. Guo and Mr. Bannon were
in business together? That's the question I would ask.
Because the government's evidence is going to show they're hand
in hand for months at a time, the government is going to allege
that Mr. Guo bought Mr. Bannon a house, the government is going
to allege, literally, that he's a co-conspirator. So if a



despicable human being is in a chain with you and you're a
woman——and, you know, as a woman, I have my own issues with
Mr. Bannon, but I'm just saying, it's not that Bannon's name is
going to appear. It's that Bannon and Mr. Guo are going to be
linked by the government. So the government's proof is that
they're in business together. Then would you be able to be
fair to Mr. Guo? That's the question. It's not a peripheral
appearance by Mr. Bannon. So if it was Donald Trump, yeah,
that's a peripheral appearance because Bannon——I mean, Mr. Guo
and Donald Trump don't stand on a yacht together announcing the
Rule of Law Foundation or doing anything else. They're
actually——the evidence is, they are together.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, the key fact about the
interaction with that prospective juror is, the Court asked
her, can you be fair and impartial, despite your prior opinions
on Mr. Bannon. She emphatically said yes. That's all that
matters. That's what matters.
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: That's not all that matters, actually.
THE COURT: I'd like to bring her back.
(Juror present)
JUROR: Hi.
THE COURT: Beforehand, you used the words "vile" and
"despicable" to describe Mr. Bannon.
JUROR: Yes.



THE COURT: And I asked you whether you could set
aside your negative feelings and come into the court with an
open mind and listen to the evidence in this case and follow my
instructions on the law and be fair and impartial. You
answered yes.
JUROR: If he's not on the witness stand. I said that
before that I don't know if I could believe his word.
THE COURT: Right. Okay. So let us assume that he's
not going to be on the witness stand but that there will be an
allegation that he has a business relationship with the
defendant. Can you set aside your negative feelings about
Mr. Bannon and come into the courtroom with an open mind and
listen to the evidence of the case, follow my instructions on
the law, and be a fair and impartial juror, knowing that that
is an allegation?
JUROR: That he has a business dealing with the
defendant.
THE COURT: Correct.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Very good. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
MR. KAMARAJU: We made our record. We're going to
renew our objection.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Your number, please.



JUROR: 40.

THE COURT: And your name.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the problem?
JUROR: The question was, do I have an issue with
Steve Bannon or former Trump officials?
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: Yes, I would have a hard time believing
anything Steve Bannon said.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
MS. SHROFF: Didn't we let her go already?
THE COURT: Yes, we did.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: I'm juror 47, your Honor.
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: I just have a——against Trump, political views
against Trump and Steve Bannon, and I don't think I would be
able to be partial in this case.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you for coming forward.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: We've already excused him.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: What is your number?
JUROR: 52.



THE COURT: Your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And the issue, please?
JUROR: And the issue is more when you mention Trump,
it just triggers the reaction. I can't in full conscience say
I will be without prejudice with the mentioning of Steve
Bannon. I would like to think I would, but I——I can't be.
THE COURT: I appreciate your candor. You may step
back.
(Juror not present)
MS. SHROFF: He was already struck, right?
THE COURT: Yes, he was.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number?
JUROR: 88.
THE COURT: And your name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what would you like to tell me?
JUROR: All I know about Mr. Guo at this point is that
he gave Steve Bannon a yacht to live on for two years, and I
think that's——I think that's accurate. And I would not really
be able to trust anything Mr. Bannon said.
THE COURT: So if I tell you that Mr. Bannon is not
going to be a witness in this case but the prosecution alleges



that Mr. Bannon and the defendant had a business relationship——
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: ——can you set aside whatever feelings that
you have based on things you've heard outside of the courtroom?
Can you set those feelings aside, come into the courtroom with
an open mind, listen to the evidence in the case, hear the
witness testimony, review the documentary evidence, follow my
instructions on the law, and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: I would do my best.
THE COURT: Well, I need a yes or no answer.
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
MR. KAMARAJU: We're going to object, your Honor, that
he's not being struck for cause. What he said was he couldn't
trust——he couldn't trust anything that Steve Bannon said. The
government's allegations are going to involve things that Steve
Bannon said, that they claim are false. What the juror says is
that he can't trust anything, he doesn't know anything about
the evidence, but a juror who says that——
THE COURT: All right. Let's bring him back.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. I believe that you said that
you would not be able to trust Steve Bannon if he was a
witness; is that correct?



JUROR: Correct. Correct.
THE COURT: Okay. So I expect that the government is
going to put forth statements made by Mr. Bannon during the
case, and so my question for you is, can you still put aside
these negative feelings that you have about Mr. Bannon and
knowing that his statements may be part of this trial, can you
come into the courtroom with an open mind and listen to the
evidence in the case, listen to the witnesses, follow my
instructions on the law, and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Very good. Step back.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What's your number?
JUROR: No. 60.
THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.
JUROR: If Steve Bannon's testimony is involved, I
can't trust a word that Bannon said. I can't——I think he's a
cheat and a liar. He and Cohen and Flynn and Trump himself and
the rest are despicable, so——
THE COURT: Thank you for your honesty. You may step
back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: He's already been excused.
MR. FINKEL: Yes. He's really been trying so, so



hard.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 89.
THE COURT: And your name, please.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: Yes. Go ahead.
JUROR: I have to be honest. It's been a minute. The
question is that Steve Bannon is going to be a witness,
potentially?
THE COURT: Not that he would be a witness but that he
is involved in the case. There's an allegation that he has a
business relationship with the defendant.
JUROR: Okay. So my political leanings are not
particularly——what's been going on over the last eight years
would lead me to have a bias against Steve Bannon. I don't
know how that would affect my view of his testimony. I would
try to be unbiased, but I can't promise that.
THE COURT: Thank you for your candor. You may step
back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: She's already been excused.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. Your number, please.
JUROR: 42.
THE COURT: And your name.



JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.

THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: So given my sort of preconceptions of one of
the individuals you mentioned, I would have a difficult time.
THE COURT: Which individual?
JUROR: Steve Bannon.
THE COURT: So you have strong feelings about
Mr. Bannon?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: You don't need to tell me whether they're
favorable or unfavorable.
JUROR: Yup.
THE COURT: But I expect the prosecution to allege
that he had a business relationship with the defendant. And
knowing that, could you put aside whatever feelings you have
towards him and come into the court with an open mind, listen
to the witness testimony, review the documentary evidence,
follow my instructions on the law, and be a fair and impartial
juror?
JUROR: In all honesty, no.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What is your number, please?
JUROR: 46.



THE COURT: And your name.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And the last name?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: Okay. And what would you like to tell me?
JUROR: About bias for Steve Bannon, right?
THE COURT: Yes.
JUROR: I wouldn't trust anything he would say under
oath if he were a witness.
THE COURT: So he's not going to be a witness.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: I expect that the government is going to
allege that he had a business relationship with the defendant.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: And so you said that you couldn't trust
him. Essentially you're expressing negative feelings toward
him. But the question is, can you put aside, can you push away
those negative feelings and come into the courtroom with an
open mind and listen to the witness testimony, review the
documentary evidence, follow my instructions on the law, and be
a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: I would think with my feelings, my bias, it
might be a little more heavy, honestly.
THE COURT: Understood. Understood. Tell me your
number, one more time.



JUROR: 46.

THE COURT: Thank you very much.
JUROR: All right. Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: So I am going to dismiss 46 for cause.
MR. FINKEL: No objection.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 75, your Honor. XXXXXXXXXX. I'd have a tough
time, given the credibility of either of those two people you
mentioned.
THE COURT: All right. Understood. You may step
back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: He's already been——
MR. FINKEL: Yeah.
MR. KAMARAJU: Yeah.
THE COURT: Yes.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: Hello. What's your number?
JUROR: Juror 94.
THE COURT: And your name.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: And what is the issue?
JUROR: I don't believe I could be a fair——hearing the



testimony from Bannon.
THE COURT: So I would not expect Mr. Bannon to
testify.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: I expect that the government is going to
say that he had a business relationship with the defendant.
And so could you put aside these feelings that you have
developed about Mr. Bannon up till now, can you put them aside
and come into the court with an open mind, listen to the
witness testimony, review the documentary evidence, follow my
instructions on the law, and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: I would do my best.
THE COURT: So I need a yes or no answer.
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: What number is that?
MS. SHROFF: 94.
THE COURT: 94. So I will excuse her for cause.
(Next juror present)
JUROR: 95.
THE COURT: One moment, sir. One moment.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: All right, sir. What is your number?
JUROR: 95.



THE COURT: Your name again?
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: What is the problem?
JUROR: So this is——this is an issue with the Trump
administration. So I believe with all the misinformation, they
divided the country to an extreme. And I believe you
specifically mentioned Steve Bannon. I remember him being on
TV where they had Trump, former Trump, Donald Trump having
personal, physical contact with Steve Bannon, and the
negative——given my negative opinion on Trump, that is my
feeling on that.
THE COURT: You're saying that you have negative
feelings toward Trump advisors?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: So the question is, well, first of all, I
don't expect Mr. Bannon to be a witness in the case. But I do
expect that the prosecution will allege that he had a business
relationship with Mr. Guo. And so the question is, can you put
aside these negative feelings that you have developed and come
into the courtroom with an open mind and listen to the witness
testimony, review the documentary evidence, and follow my
instructions on the law and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: I'll definitely give it a try, but the thing
is, I cannot view him as an honest person because he definitely
did contribute a lot toward the Donald Trump——former election



of Donald Trump, president Trump. I mean, I have no idea
whether he is a——I have no idea. But if he is here as a
witness and if I'm hearing him, I cannot give a hundred percent
confidence that I'll completely trust.
THE COURT: So he's not going to appear as a witness.
JUROR: Okay, okay, okay.
THE COURT: The allegation is that Mr. Guo has
business dealings with him.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: And so he will be mentioned.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: And the question is whether you can put
aside your negative feelings about him that you come into the
courtroom with now.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: And you can be aware that you have these
negative feelings, but push them aside and come into the
courtroom with an open mind, listen to the witness testimony,
review the documentary evidence, and be a fair and impartial
juror.
JUROR: I'll definitely try.
THE COURT: Okay. You can step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: He's number what?
MR. FINKEL: 95.



JUROR: I'm going to dismiss him for cause.
(Next juror present)
THE COURT: No. 98? Your name, ma'am.
JUROR: Yes, my name is XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
JUROR: I find the previous administration's sense of
alternative facts to be the root of a significant threat to
American democracy; I find Mr. Bannon to be as repugnant a
human being as you can find; I think that he's a liar, that
he's a master manipulator, probably a thief; and I can't
imagine any evidence that would change my mind about that.
THE COURT: Thank you for your candor. You may step
back.
JUROR: Thank you.
(Juror not present)
(Next juror present)
JUROR: Good afternoon.
THE COURT: You're No. 22? And your name, sir.
JUROR: XXXXXXXXXX.
THE COURT: Okay. And what would you like to say?
JUROR: Yes. I think my concern is really about Steve
Bannon. I happen to listen to the news a lot, and I personally
don't like his position when it comes to race matters, his view
on people like me. So whatever he has to say, really, I don't
really find anything positive coming out of him. So him——with



that in mind, him as a witness would——I think it would——it will
impair or affect my judgment of anything he has to say.
THE COURT: So he will not be appearing as a witness.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: The government alleges that Mr. Bannon had
a business relationship with Mr. Guo.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: And so there will be statements made by
Mr. Bannon, but he is not going to be present in the courtroom.
And so the question is, can you put aside these negative
feelings that you already have about him, can you put them
aside, come into the courtroom with an open mind, listen to the
witness testimony, review the documentary evidence, follow my
instructions on the law, and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: Those are the concerns that I would try to
work on, but I will work on it is what I can say standing right
here. I would try to work on it. I can't give a definite yes
or no, right now, just because of those feelings.
THE COURT: Okay. You may step back.
JUROR: Okay.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: He's 22? I'm going to excuse him for
cause.
MR. KAMARAJU: Your Honor, we were just going to ask
if you would ask a specific question with respect to statements



from Mr. Bannon as part of the government's proof with jurors
11 and 16.
THE COURT: If you'll have 11 come back.
MS. MURRAY: 16 was struck.
MR. KAMARAJU: Oh, 16 was struck? Then obviously——
MS. SHROFF: No. No. You have the wrong number then.
MR. KAMARAJU: 15, your Honor. I apologize.
MS. SHROFF: 11 and 15, your Honor. I'm sorry.
(Continued on next page)



MR. FINKEL: The government has no objection to the
additional question about the statements. I think really the
heart of the matter is whether the jurors can be fair and
impartial or whether they would associate that because the
defendant had a business relationship with him, they couldn't
be fair and impartial and they couldn't put that out of their
mind. That's really the inquiry.
MS. SHROFF: It's not just a business relationship.
The government is going to argue that they were on a yacht
together for days and weeks at a time; that he lived with
Bannon and Guo, they lived together; Guo gave him a ton of
money; Bannon joins in his political movement.
We're not talking about a business relationship where,
you know, to a bank, I lent him ten grand and then he didn't
pay my ten grand back. There's a business relationship, and
then there's Guo and Bannon. And that is going to come from
the government. They are going to put that forward.
MR. KAMARAJU: Just to be specific, the particular
part of the business relationship are businesses that the
government alleges to be part of the racketeering enterprise,
so GTV, the Rule of Law Foundation. So it's not sort of an
esoteric relationship.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, really what they're getting
at is whether the juror — and this is a fair question, whether
the juror would associate Mr. Bannon -- the mere association



between the two of them would tend to make the juror have a
bias against the defendant, find against the defendant. That's
really the question. And if the answer to that is yes, I think
the government wouldn't object to cause.
THE COURT: All right. We'll have her come in.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. I had mentioned before that
Mr. Bannon is not going to be a witness. But the government
alleges that there was a business relationship between Mr. Guo,
the defendant, and Mr. Bannon.
Is the fact that they had this relationship going to
cause you to be biased against Mr. Guo?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: You can be a fair and impartial juror
despite that?
JUROR: Yes, your Honor.
THE COURT: Please step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: I'm going as far as I'm going to go.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hello again.
JUROR: This is very nerve-racking.
THE COURT: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You're number again?
JUROR: 15.



THE COURT: Okay. So I had mentioned before that
Mr. Bannon is not going to be testifying.
JUROR: Okay.
THE COURT: What is alleged is that the defendant,
Mr. Guo, and Mr. Bannon had a business relationship. The fact
that the government will allege that they had a business
relationship, is that going to cause you to be biased against
Mr. Guo, the defendant?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: You can be fair and impartial?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: All righty. Please step back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: Is that it?
THE LAW CLERK: Yes, Judge.
THE COURT: Okay.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Do you have any strong views about
cryptocurrency that would prevent you from being a fair and
impartial juror?
All righty. If you'll step up please.
(At sidebar)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there.
JUROR: Hi there.



THE COURT: And what is your number?
JUROR: 99.
THE COURT: Okay. What did you want to tell me?
JUROR: Well, I never care for the whole idea of
cryptocurrency because I felt like who do they think they are,
trying to change the American gold standard? And so it turned
me off. And I thought that it was just some kind of ripoff,
the people, kind of falsehood.
THE COURT: Okay. Thank you for your candor.
All right. You may go back.
(Juror not present)
THE COURT: We can go back.
MS. SHROFF: Okay. Thank you.
Your Honor, are we going till 5 today, straight
through?^
THE COURT: Oh, yes, yes, yes.
MS. SHROFF: I just want to know if you're going to
take a bathroom break.
THE COURT: I'm not going to take a break unless one
of these potential jurors asks me.
MS. SHROFF: All right. Then I'll just grin and bear
it.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Is it your opinion that the actions
charged in the indictment as I have described them should not



be crimes or should not be prosecuted by the government?
Have you been involved as a defendant, victim,
witness, or in any other way in any prosecution for fraud or
money laundering?
The defendant is charged with acting with others in
committing the alleged crimes. Some of those other individuals
are not on trial in this case. You may not draw any inference,
favorable or unfavorable, toward the government or the
defendant from that fact. You also may not speculate as to the
reason why other persons are not on trial.
Would any of you have any difficulty following this
instruction?
Have you, a family member or close friend, ever been
involved or appeared as a witness in any investigation by a
federal or state grand jury or by a congressional or state
legislative committee, licensing authority or governmental
agency?
Have you, a family member or close friend, ever been
questioned in any manner by a federal, state, or local law
enforcement agency, including the FBI?
Your number please?
JUROR: 76.
THE COURT: Okay. And what happened?
JUROR: I tried to be an FBI agent when I was about 21
years old and I went through the whole process.



THE COURT: Okay. Thank you for letting me know.
Anybody else? Your number?
JUROR: 15. I have numerous friends and family that
work for the federal government. And one or two of them, I was
interviewed by the FBI as part of their security clearance.
THE COURT: So you essentially were a reference for
those individuals?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: Is there anything about that experience
that would cause you to be biased in favor of or against either
party in this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Anybody else?
Have you, a family member or close friend, ever been a
witness or a complainant in any hearing or trial, whether
state, local, or federal?
JUROR: No. 10. I was a witness probably 25 years
ago. And I worked in retail for shoplifting cases, but that's
about it.
THE COURT: And what court did you appear in?
JUROR: Queens, Queens County Court.
THE COURT: And is there anything about that
experience as a witness in a shoplifting case that would
prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No.



THE COURT: Did you witness the shoplifting?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Would that make you favor the government
in this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you be biased against the
government?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would it make you favor the defendant in
the case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you be biased against the defendant?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Are you, a family member or close friend,
under subpoena or, to your knowledge, about to be subpoenaed in
a criminal case?
Have you, a family member or close friend, ever been
charged with a crime?
Have you, a family member or close friend, ever been
the subject of any investigation or accusation by any grand
jury, federal or state? If you'll step up, please.
(At sidebar)
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi there. What is your number?
JUROR: 16.



THE COURT: And what did you want to tell me?
JUROR: My grandfather was accused of fraud and
assault by a partner. And he was put in jail briefly. I don't
think it was -- he was ever fully charged. But he -- he was
put in jail because of assault towards her, and she accused him
of fraud. Social Security fraud, I think.
THE COURT: All righty. Thank you very much.
(Juror not present)
(In open court)
THE COURT: Anyone else? Okay.
Have you, a family member or close friend, ever been
the victim of a crime?
Go ahead. Your number?
JUROR: 89. I was mugged.
THE COURT: All righty. Thank you for letting me
know.
Who else?
JUROR: 52.
THE COURT: No. 52. You're saying that you were
mugged; is that correct?
JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: Who else?
JUROR: No. 58. My car was stolen.
THE COURT: No. 58. Your car was stolen.
And so when did that happen?



JUROR: About ten years ago.
THE COURT: And where was that?
JUROR: In Brooklyn.
THE COURT: Did you report that to the police?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Did you get the car back?
JUROR: I did. Not in good condition, but, yes.
THE COURT: Were you satisfied with the way the police
handled the case?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Is there anything about that experience
that would cause you to be biased against the defendant?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you favor the defendant?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you be biased against the
government?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you favor the government?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Who else?
JUROR: My sister was recently shot.
THE COURT: I'm so sorry to hear that. Is she okay?
JUROR: She is alive, but "okay" would be stretching
it.



THE COURT: Very sorry to hear that. And I hope that
she recovers.
Who else?
JUROR: I was mugged twice.
THE COURT: And what number are you?
JUROR: Oh, 88. Sorry.
THE COURT: And when did those muggings happen?
JUROR: Probably 20, 25 years ago.
THE COURT: Was that here in New York?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: And did you report the muggings?
JUROR: Yes. Well, one I reported one -- no, I
reported both of them.
THE COURT: And was anybody held accountable?
JUROR: Well, the perpetrator of the second mugging
was arrested for a much worse mugging. And he was held
accountable for that. I don't know what happened to my case.
THE COURT: And the first matter was not dealt with at
all?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Okay. So given that you were mugged twice
and no one was held accountable for those muggings, would that
interfere with your ability to be a fair and impartial juror in
this case?
JUROR: No.



THE COURT: Anybody else?
JUROR: 16. My boyfriend was mugged a couple of
months ago.
THE COURT: Thank you for telling me.
One moment.
JUROR: Hello. No. 42.
THE COURT: And what happened?
JUROR: I had money removed from my bank account on
two occasions by an illegal -- by somebody else who shouldn't
have been doing that.
THE COURT: Who else?
JUROR: No. 90. My home was burglarized.
THE COURT: And where was that?
JUROR: In Westchester County.
THE COURT: And was anybody held accountable?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: And when did this happen?
JUROR: 2015.
THE COURT: You reported it to the police?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Were you satisfied with the way the police
handled the case?
JUROR: Yes, but we lost a lot of things.
THE COURT: So considering that, your house was
burglarized, you lost possessions, no one was held accountable,



would that cause you to have a bias against the defendant in
this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you have a bias against the
government in this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you be biased in favor of the
defendant?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Biased in favor of the government?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Is there anything that would prevent you
from being a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Anyone else?
Have you ever served on a jury or grand jury in
federal or state court? What number?
JUROR: 76.
THE COURT: And when was that?
JUROR: I would say about 20 years ago.
THE COURT: Okay. Who else?
JUROR: 75. A grand jury here in the Southern
District about six or seven years ago.
THE COURT: Who else?
JUROR: Juror 77. Like four or five years ago, here.



THE COURT: Here in this courthouse?
JUROR: No, it was state.
THE COURT: It was state court?
JUROR: Yeah.
THE COURT: And was it a civil or criminal case?
JUROR: Criminal.
THE COURT: And without telling me the verdict, did
you reach a verdict?
JUROR: Partial. Not all the counts --
THE COURT: Did the jury reach a unanimous verdict on
at least one count?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. Given your experience in state
court, is there anything that would prevent you from being a
fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Who else?
JUROR: Number 88. I've been on civil and criminal in
New York state and also federal court.
THE COURT: In what county?
JUROR: Manhattan, New York.
THE COURT: And the criminal cases that you were on,
did they reach a verdict?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. And the civil cases, what happened



in those cases?
JUROR: Reached a verdict.
THE COURT: And how recent was the most recent jury
service?
JUROR: That I was actually on the case?
THE COURT: That you were a member of the jury.
JUROR: 20 years ago, I would say.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: 42. This was a state case, criminal, well
over ten years ago.
THE COURT: Thank you.
Who else?
JUROR: No. 52. I was in a civil case in Kings County
about 15 years ago.
THE COURT: Thank you.
Who else?
JUROR: So No. 12. I was on a state criminal case in
2016 as an alternate juror.
THE COURT: And were you placed on the jury? Did you
substitute in for one of the jurors?
JUROR: I was on the jury; so I listened to the entire
trial, but I was excused before the decision.
THE COURT: So you didn't participate in reaching a
verdict; correct?
JUROR: Correct.



THE COURT: How long ago was that?
JUROR: 2016.
THE COURT: Okay. Who else?
JUROR: No. 5. Civil. Ten years ago.
THE COURT: Where?
JUROR: Manhattan county.
THE COURT: And did that go to verdict?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay.
JUROR: Criminal trial in the Bronx, Bronx Criminal
Court, 15 years ago maybe.
THE COURT: All right. Without telling me the
verdict, did the jury reach a verdict?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Okay. Is there anything about that
experience that would prevent you from being a fair and
impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you give the microphone to Juror No.
5.
Is there anything about your experience being a juror
that would prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror in
this case?
JUROR: No, ma'am.
THE COURT: The government witnesses in this case will



include agents and analysts from the FBI. Would any of you be
more or less likely to believe a witness merely because he or
she is a law enforcement officer? And I address this question
to those who have not already answered it.
Some of the evidence admitted at trial may come from
searches performed by law enforcement officers. I instruct you
that those searches were legal and that the evidence obtained
from those searches is admissible in this case.
Do any of you have strong feelings about searches
conducted by law enforcement officers or the use of evidence
obtained from such searches that would interfere with your
ability to be a fair and impartial juror in this case?
Does anyone have any expectations about the types of
evidence that the government or the defendant should or will
present in this criminal trial or in a criminal trial more
generally?
Would everyone be able to follow the Court's
instruction that the government is not required to use any
particular technique in order to investigate a case? Is there
anybody who would not be able to follow that instruction?
Under our system of law, the jury determines the facts
and the Court determines the law. These two areas are separate
and distinct. At the end of the case, I will instruct you on
the law. You're required to accept the law as I explain it to
you. It will be your job to determine the facts subject to my



explanation of the law. You may not substitute your notions of
what the law is or what you think it should be.
Is there anyone who feels that he or she is either
unwilling or unable to apply the law as I explain it to you?
Under our system of law, every defendant is presumed
innocent and cannot be found guilty unless a jury, having heard
all the evidence in the case, unanimously decides that the
evidence proves his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
Is there anyone who has any difficulty accepting the
law or the presumption of innocence as to the defendant?
Under our system of law, the burden of proof is on the
government. That burden never shifts to the defense. The
defendant does not have to prove his innocence, present any
evidence, testify, or cross-examine any of the government's
witnesses. If the defendant chooses not to testify, you cannot
hold that against him. Is there any juror who cannot follow
that instruction?
Conversely, if defense counsel decides to put on a
case on the defendant's behalf, that fact does not shift the
burden of proof to the defendant, nor does it diminish the
obligation of the government to prove the defendant's guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt. Would any of you have any
difficulty following this principle?
The law provides that only the evidence produced here
in the courtroom may be used by you to determine whether the



government has met its burden of proving the defendant's guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt. You may not consider any outside
facts beyond the trial evidence. Is there anyone who has
difficulty accepting that law?
The law provides that the question of punishment is
for the judge alone to decide. The question of the possible
sentence that the defendant may receive cannot enter into your
deliberations as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
Is there any juror who cannot follow that instruction?
If the evidence establishes the defendant's guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt, is there anyone who feels that they
could not render a verdict of guilty?
If the evidence does not establish the defendant's
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, is there anyone who feels that
they could not render a verdict of not guilty?
Do any of you have any legal training? And I address
this question to those of you who have not already answered it.
What number are you?
JUROR: No. 40.
THE COURT: And what is the nature of your legal
training?
JUROR: I used to work for the Coalition of the
International criminal Court.
THE COURT: Okay. Who else?
JUROR: That's it for me.



THE COURT: Does anyone have any religious,
philosophical, or other beliefs that would make him or her
unable to render a verdict?
All righty. I am now going to move on to questioning
the individual jurors. I'm going to start with No. 2.
If you would state your number.
JUROR: No. 2.

neighborhood during the last five years.

THE COURT: How do you spend your spare time?
JUROR: Reading or playing video games.
THE COURT: Is there anything that would prevent you
from being a fair and impartial juror in this case?
JUROR: I don't believe so.
THE COURT: It calls for a yes or no answer.
JUROR: Sorry, no. Yeah, no. Sorry.
THE COURT: Now, going on to No. 4. If you would
state your number, your county of residence -- I'm sorry,
you're No. 3. No, I'm going to No. 4.
If you would state your number, your county of
residence, and your neighborhood during the past five years.
JUROR: I'm No. 4. I live in the Bronx for the past

And I expect that there will be law enforcement
witnesses in this case. Would you be able to judge their

any other witness?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Would you tend to have a bias in favor of
a law enforcement witness?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you have a bias against a law
enforcement witness?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Is there anything about your husband's
job, former job, that would prevent you from being fair and
impartial in this case?
JUROR: Maybe. Because I hear him all the time
talking about, you know, the news. And I'm listening to
opinions.
THE COURT: All right. So many people express
opinions one way or the other. And, of course, sometimes you
have different opinions from your husband.



JUROR: Correct.
THE COURT: And so my question is can you put aside
his opinions and treat both sides in this case fairly?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Do you think that because your husband was
in law enforcement, that that will give you a bias in favor of
the prosecution?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you have a bias against the
prosecution?
JUROR: No.
THE COURT: Would you be in favor of the defendant?
JUROR: I've had -- I don't -- no.
THE COURT: Would you be against the defendant?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: So are you saying that you have a bias
against the defendant?
JUROR: Repeat it?
THE COURT: In other words, do you come into this
courtroom already with feelings against the defendant?
JUROR: To be perfectly honest, yes, because I've
experienced --
THE COURT: So the question is can you put aside any
previous experiences that you may have and come into the
courtroom with an open mind, listen to the witness testimony,



evaluate the documentary evidence, listen to my instructions on
the law, and be a fair and impartial juror?
JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: Are there any other adults in the
household who work?
JUROR: My son.

(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: With regard to Juror No. 8, I don't think
he is sufficiently fluent in English to serve as a juror. Is
there any objection to my dismissing him?
MR. FINKEL: Not from the government.



MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. So I want to go over——well,
first of all, are there any questions that you want me to pose
to any particular jurors who are left?
MR. FINKEL: No, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: We're going to make a for-cause
challenge to No. 7 at the time your Honor thinks is
appropriate.
THE COURT: On what grounds?
MR. KAMARAJU: Her husband is a retired NYPD
detective. Originally when your Honor asked her whether she
was biased against the defendant, she said yes based on the
conversations that her——I want to make sure I'm not too
close——based on conversations she had overheard with her
husband and a friend, and while your Honor asked a subsequent
question, she seemed very hesitant, to us, to answer in the
affirmative, and her most definitive and clear answer was that
she would be biased against the defendant.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, you followed up and asked
that potential juror whether she agreed with everything her
husband says and she said no. You said, are you able to put
aside opinions you may have heard from other people and decide
the issues in this case based on what you hear in this
courtroom, are you biased against any of the people in this
courtroom, she said no, and she said she could be a fair and



impartial juror.
THE COURT: That's right. I'm not going to dismiss
her for cause.
Anybody else?
MR. KAMARAJU: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay. So I just want to go over, is there
any individual that I have not gotten to? Oh, that means other
than 14 and 29, who did not come back after lunch.
MR. KAMARAJU: Oh, yeah. Thank you, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Nothing from the government.
THE COURT: All right, then.
MS. SHROFF: Could we have one——
MR. KAMARAJU: Was 96 addressed?
MR. FINKEL: We have 96 struck, but——
THE COURT: Let me see.
MS. SHROFF: So, your Honor, we would request that the
Court bring No. 7 back and ask her if she can actually be fair
and impartial in this case because I don't think the way she
answered, after a long pause and said yes——essentially, in
light of her previous answer that she said she could not be
fair, I would ask that the Court make a last inquiry of her.
THE COURT: So I think she was rehabilitated
completely and so I am not going to pursue this any further.
Juror 96 was struck.
All righty. So I am going to excuse those people who



have been dismissed, and those who have not, I'll have them
wait and we'll go through the peremptory challenges.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, can I make sure we understand
the peremptory system. So is it correct that essentially the
first 12 remaining jurors, whoever is last, that the defense
can strike as many as they want up to 10, and after they choose
those 10, whoever's left, the government can strike whichever
six, up to six, it wants?
THE COURT: Okay. So no.
MS. SHROFF: No.
THE COURT: So we start in round one, and the defense
strikes whomever they decide to. Now they might take all 10,
but I highly doubt it. So let's assume that they take two.
Then you're going to have a stab at the remaining 10.
MR. FINKEL: Okay.
THE COURT: Then there's another round with the
defense, and they get to strike as many as they have left, and
then you get your opportunity to do the same, and we just go
like that until they have eliminated all of their strikes.
MR. FINKEL: I see. In groups of 12 then.
THE COURT: Always in a group of 12.
MR. FINKEL: Okay. And sorry to——so we will know who
they're going to strike.
THE COURT: It's going to be out loud. I'm going to
announce it, and it will be obvious.



MR. FINKEL: Okay. Thank you.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor——
MR. FERGENSON: Your Honor——oh, go ahead.
MS. SHROFF: Okay. So your Honor, two things. One
is, does the defense go first each time or do we rotate, we go
first and then they go?
THE COURT: The defense goes first every time.
MS. SHROFF: Okay. And two, your Honor, we do need to
talk to the client before we exercise the peremptories. So
you're not going to make me do it tonight?
THE COURT: Oh, no, no, no, we are doing it today. If
you want to talk to your client, then he's sitting right next
to you.
MS. SHROFF: I just didn't know. I thought we ended
at 5.
THE COURT: It's not 5 yet.
MS. SHROFF: It's past 5.
THE COURT: I'm sorry. I read my clock wrong. So
forgive me for that. We're going to have to come back
tomorrow.
MS. SHROFF: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that.
Thank you, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: I was just going to ask a numbers
question. Do we have the count of nonstruck jurors? I wasn't
sure if there was enough.



MS. MURRAY: 21; 23 with the two who didn't come back
from lunch. So if they come back and they do the individual
tomorrow, it would be 23, but right now there are 21.
MR. KAMARAJU: Is that enough? Do we need more?
THE COURT: Well, we can go with the ones that we
have, and then we're going bring up another bunch.
MR. KAMARAJU: Okay. That's what I wasn't sure, your
Honor, if you wanted to do that first, bring up the others
first.
THE COURT: I want to do this group first.
MS. SHROFF: All right. Thank you, your Honor.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, just a logistical point. So
it appears we're going to be finished with jury selection
tomorrow. We'll go right into witnesses? We flew in witnesses
from out of state. We expect to be going. We're ready. And
we just want to make sure that expectation is correct and not
wrong.
MS. SHROFF: Are we sitting this Friday?
MR. FINKEL: Yes.
THE COURT: Remember I said we're on Fridays.
MS. SHROFF: No, no. I thought there was some
disagreement this morning. That's why I'm asking.
THE COURT: Yeah. We're going to go.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, your Honor.
MR. FERGENSON: Your Honor, I'm sorry. I just wanted



to make sure I understood the peremptories. So in your
hypothetical, we had 12, defense struck two, and suppose we
didn't strike any; are those 10 people on the jury?
THE COURT: They're on the jury.
MR. FERGENSON: Got it.
THE COURT: If you don't strike any, then we're just
going to add another couple and you're going to be then dealing
with those two. Exactly.
MR. FINKEL: Oh, okay.
THE COURT: Yes.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, if you could excuse me at
1:00 tomorrow for ten minutes.
THE COURT: Yes. Absolutely.
THE COURT: All right. The jurors are going to be
housed in 26A when they come back tomorrow morning. Okay.
MR. KAMARAJU: Thank you, your Honor.
(In open court)
THE COURT: All right, then. At this time

attorneys are not allowed to have any contact with you, so
don't hold it against them if they don't acknowledge you if you
see them.
So have a good evening, and I will see you tomorrow at
9 a.m.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, I'm sorry. May we just have
a quick sidebar for a moment.
THE COURT: Yes.
(At the sidebar)
MS. SHROFF: Maybe I missed it, but there is a juror
who is sitting there who was——I don't think he was ever
questioned, right? I think he's a late return.
MR. FINKEL: Wait a minute.
THE COURT: Wait one second. Which number is it?



MS. SHROFF: I don't know his number. He's the young
man who's sitting there. I think your law clerk knows.
THE LAW CLERK: 29. He came back late. He was one of
the ones who we were going to question tomorrow.
THE COURT: He'll have to come in with the remaining
75.
MR. FINKEL: What is the issue? I'm sorry. I missed
it.
MS. SHROFF: He wasn't questioned, Juror No. 29.
That's all.
THE COURT: Okay. I wanted to clarify something also
about the jury selection. It's in groups of 12. I just want
to make sure that everybody understands it. The first round is
a group of 12. The second round is a group of 12. Okay.
MS. MURRAY: Just one logistical question. If we do
impanel a jury tomorrow at some point before the 2:45, which
would be a typical trial day cutoff, do we expect to sit a full
day until 5 and go straight into openings or would you envision
that once the jury is impaneled, we go back to the Court's
typical trial day schedule?
THE COURT: So I just don't think that we're going to
finish in time to get started with openings. So I'll say we'll
finish with jury selection tomorrow and then open on the
following day.
MR. FINKEL: So we won't have any witnesses until



Friday.
THE COURT: Understood.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you, your Honor.
(In open court)
THE COURT: All right, then. So tomorrow morning,
26A, 9 a.m. Have a good evening.
(Jury venire not present)
THE COURT: So in my eagerness to push through, I lost
track of the time. You shouldn't hesitate to ask for a sidebar
to address that.
All right. See you tomorrow.
ALL COUNSEL: Thank you, your Honor.
(Adjourned to May 23, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.)
