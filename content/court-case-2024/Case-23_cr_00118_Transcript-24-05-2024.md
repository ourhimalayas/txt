(A jury of 12 and six alternates was duly impaneled
and sworn)
THE COURT: Counsel, would you approach, please.
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: Who's opening for the government?
MR. FERGENSON: I am, your Honor.
THE COURT: And for the defense.
MS. SHROFF: I am.
THE COURT: All right. You may step back.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Good morning.
THE JURORS: Good morning.
THE COURT: Members of the jury, the case is
officially on trial, and you are the jurors in the case. As
you can see, the jury is composed of 12 members. In addition,
there are six alternates. If you are an alternate, you need to
pay as close attention to the evidence as the jury. If for any
reason any one of the members of the jury is unable to serve,
an alternate will be required to step into the place of that
juror.
I now will give you some preliminary instructions to
guide you in your participation in the trial.
The second part of the trial is about to start. This
part is the opening statement by the prosecution. In the



O5O1GUO

opening statement by the government, he's required to indicate
to you what the prosecution intends to prove by way of evidence
to support the charges against the defendant. Once the
government's opening statement has been completed, defense
counsel has the option to make an opening statement.
Now what attorneys say in an opening statement is not
evidence. An opening statement is, in a sense, a preview of
what the attorney expects that the evidence will show.
Next, the government will present a witness and will
ask the witness questions. This is called direct examination.
Once the government completes those questions, the defense will
then be given an opportunity to question the witness. This is
called cross-examination. This process will continue for each
witness the prosecution will present to give testimony.
When the government finishes calling all of its
witnesses, the defense will be given the opportunity to present
witnesses also. Remember, the defense need not prove anything.
Therefore, they do not have to cross-examine the government's
witnesses or offer their own witnesses.
Once both sides have finished presenting witnesses,
the defense and the prosecution will be given the opportunity
to make closing remarks to you. These closing arguments will
not be evidence. They are just arguments made by the attorneys
to discuss the facts and circumstances in the case, and they
should be confined to the evidence and to reasonable inferences



O5O1GUO

to be drawn from the evidence. So again, neither opening
statements nor closing remarks are evidence, and you should
disregard any statement or argument made by the attorney that
is not based on the evidence.
After closing arguments, I will give you detailed
instructions on the law that relates to this particular case.
When I finish my instructions, you will then retire to
deliberate to reach a verdict.
Now I'm going to instruct you on evidence. First let
me tell you what evidence is.
Basically, evidence consists of oral testimony under
oath, any stipulations of the parties, and physical exhibits
during the trial that are introduced by either the prosecution
or the defense and allowed into evidence. If an exhibit is
given to you to examine, you should examine it carefully,
individually, and without comment.
There are two types of evidence——direct and
circumstantial. Direct evidence is direct proof of a fact such
as testimony of an eyewitness. Circumstantial evidence is
proof of facts from which you may infer or conclude that other
facts exist. There's a simple example of circumstantial
evidence that is often used in this courthouse. Assume that
when you came into the courthouse this morning, the sun was
shining and it was a nice day. Assume that the courtroom
shades were down and you could not look outside. As you were



O5O1GUO

sitting here, someone walked in with an umbrella that was
dripping wet. Then a few minutes later, another person also
entered with a wet umbrella. Now you cannot look outside the
courtroom and you cannot see whether or not it is raining, so
you have no direct evidence of that fact, but on the
combination of facts that I have asked you to assume, it would
be reasonable and logical for you to conclude that it had been
raining. That is all there is to circumstantial evidence. You
infer, on the basis of reason and experience and common sense,
from one established fact the existence or nonexistence of some
other fact.
Not all circumstantial evidence presents clear,
compelling inference. The strength of the inferences arising
from circumstantial evidence is for you to decide. I will give
you further instructions on these as well as other matters at
the end of the case, but have in mind that you may consider
both kinds of evidence.
If you're instructed that some evidence is received
for a limited purpose only, you must follow that instruction.
Questions asked by either attorney or even myself are
not in and of themselves evidence. Only questions coupled with
answers are evidence. Therefore, you may not infer any fact
from the mere asking of a question. The reason that I point
this out to you is simple. During the course of questioning,
the prosecution and the defense may exercise their right to



O5O1GUO

object to the other's question, to an answer given to a
question, or to introduction of an exhibit on the ground that
the attorney believes it is somehow legally improper or
inadmissible. At that point I will sustain or overrule the
objection. If I sustain an objection to a question, you must
disregard the question and any answer, if one has been given.
You must also draw no inference from the question or from any
answer. Nor are you to speculate as to what the witness would
have said if permitted to answer.
Evidence stricken from the record must likewise be
disregarded.
Conversely, if I overrule the objection, the question
will be allowed and the answer will stand, and it remains as
evidence. When I overrule an objection to any evidence, you
must not give such evidence any more weight than if the
objection had not been made.
Please bear in mind that my rulings on the law are
simply that, and under no circumstance are such rulings to be
considered by you as indicating that I have any opinion as to
the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Under our law, the
judge may not and will not entertain any opinion as to the
guilt or innocence of the accused. Members of the jury, you
and you alone are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts.
Now I want you to understand that objections may come
rather quickly, and at times either party may seem worried.



O5O1GUO

Please do not resent this or penalize either party for this.
Understand that they are just doing their job and this is part
of it.
As I stated at the beginning, you are the triers of
fact. Therefore, it is up to you to decide which witness to
believe and which witness not to believe. Furthermore, you
will decide how much of every witness's testimony to accept and
how much to reject.
How do you decide what to believe and what not to
believe? Listen to the witnesses, watch them, and observe
them, then decide whether you believe or disbelieve them in the
same way that you decide such questions in your everyday life.
Did they know what they were talking about? Were they candid,
honest, open, and truthful? Do they have a reason to falsify,
exaggerate, or distort their testimony? Just use your common
sense in evaluating all testimony. All that is asked of you is
that you apply the same common sense you would apply in your
everyday lives to determine who is telling you the truth, who
is not, and who is telling you something less than the full
truth.
Please remember that it is the quality of the evidence
that controls, not the quantity of the evidence, or the number
of witnesses called by either side.
You must decide the case solely on the evidence and
law before you, and must not be influenced by any personal



O5O1GUO

likes or dislikes, opinions, prejudices, sympathy, or biases,
including unconscious bias. Unconscious or implicit biases are
stereotypes, attitudes, or preferences that people may
consciously reject but which may be expressed without conscious
awareness, control, or intention. Like conscious bias,
unconscious bias too can affect how we evaluate information to
make decisions. All of us, no matter how hard we try, tend to
look at others and tend to weigh what they have to say through
the lens of our own experience and background. We each have a
tendency to stereotype others and to make assumptions about
them. Often we see lights and evaluate evidence through a
clouded filter that tends to favor those like ourselves. You
must do your best to put aside such stereotypes, for all
litigants and witnesses are entitled to a level playing field
in which we do the best that we can to put aside stereotypes
and prejudices. You are to be guided solely by the evidence in
the case and my instructions on the law.
Although you are the sole judges of the facts, my job
is to be the sole judge of the law. You must accept the law as
I give it to you, without any hesitation or reservation. You
must accept the law as I give it even if you privately disagree
with me or the law.
There are three basic principles of law that apply to
this and all criminal cases——the presumption of innocence, the
prosecution's burden, and the standard of proof.



O5O1GUO

First, the presumption of innocence. A defendant is
presumed innocent, and that presumption remains with the
defendant throughout the trial and is not removed unless and
until the defendant's guilt is proven beyond a reasonable
doubt. The indictment containing the charges against the
defendant is only an accusation, nothing more. It is not proof
of guilt or anything else. Therefore, because no evidence has
been presented to you as of yet, if you were to deliberate
right now, you would have to find the defendant not guilty.
Second is the prosecution's burden. The burden of
proof is on the government. The defense has no burden and is
not required to do anything to prove his innocence. The
defense has the option of just sitting back and doing nothing.
Why? Because the defense has no burden of proof, and the
defendant is presumed innocent. The defendant is not required
to put on a defense or call any witnesses because of the
presumption of innocence. If the defendant chooses not to take
the stand, to testify on his behalf, you may not draw any
negative inference from that; in other words, you cannot hold
that against the defendant.
Third is the standard of proof. The prosecution is
required to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt. This standard does not require the prosecution to prove
the defendant's guilt beyond all doubt or to a mathematical
certainty. The prosecution does, however, have to prove the



O5O1GUO

defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The doubt is not
reasonable if, instead of being based on the nature and quality
of the evidence or the insufficiency of the evidence, it is
based on some guess or whim or speculation unrelated to the
evidence.
In my final instructions to you at the end of the
trial, I will give you detailed instructions on the law as to
the specific charges against the defendant. Those instructions
are intended to guide you through your deliberations and to
enable you to reach your decision.
Finally, I'm now going to instruct you on how you must
conduct yourselves during the trial.
You must keep an open mind during the trial.
You must keep your eyes open during the trial.
You may not ask the witnesses questions.
Do not converse, either amongst yourselves or with
anyone else, about anything related to the case. You may tell
the people with whom you live and your employer that you are a
juror and give them information about when you'll be required
to be in court, but you may not talk with them or anyone else
about anything related to the case. Do not at any time during
the trial request, accept, agree to accept, or discuss with any
person the receipt or acceptance of any payment or benefit in
return for supplying information about the trial. You must
promptly report directly to me any incident within your



O5O1GUO

knowledge involving an attempt by any person to improperly
influence you or any other member of the jury.
Do not visit or view the premises or place where the
charged crimes were allegedly committed or any other premises
or place involved in the case. And you may not use internet
maps or Google Earth or any other program or device to search
for and view any location stated in the testimony.
Do not read, view, or listen to any accounts or
discussions of the case reported by newspapers, television,
radio, the internet, social media, or any other form of news
media. Do not attempt to research any fact, issue, or law
related to this case, whether by discussion with others, by
research in a library, or on the internet, or by any other
means or source.
In this age of instant electronic communication and
research, I want to emphasize that in addition to not
conversing face to face with anyone about the case, you must
not communicate with anyone about the case by any other means,
including by telephone, text messages, email, internet chat or
chat rooms, blogs, or social websites, such as Facebook and X.
You must not provide any information about the case to anyone
by any means whatsoever, and that includes the posting of
information about the case or what you are doing in the case,
on any device or internet site, including blogs, chat rooms,
social websites, or any other means.



O5O1GUO

You must also not Google or otherwise search for any
information about the case or the law that applies to the case
or the people involved in the case, including the defendant,
the witnesses, the lawyers, and myself.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to understand
why these rules are so important. Our law does not permit
jurors to converse with anyone else about the case or for
anyone to talk to them about the case because only jurors are
authorized to render a verdict, only you have been found to be
fair, and only you have promised to be fair. No one else has
been so qualified.
Our law also does not permit jurors to converse among
themselves about the case until the judge tells them to begin
deliberations, because premature discussion can lead to a
premature final decision.
Our law also does not permit you to visit a place
discussed in the testimony. First, you cannot always be sure
that the place is in the same condition as it was on the day in
question; second, even if it were in the same condition, once
you go to a place discussed in the testimony to evaluate the
evidence in light of what you see, you become a witness, not a
juror. As a witness, you may now have an erroneous view of the
scene that may not be subject to correction by either party.
That is not fair.
Finally, our law requires that you not read or listen



O5O1GUO

to any news accounts of the case and that you not attempt to
research any fact, issue, or law related to the case. Your
decision must be based solely on the testimony and other
evidence presented in the courtroom. It would not be fair to
the parties for you to base your decision on some reporter's
view or opinion or upon information you acquire outside of the
courtroom.
These rules are designed to help guarantee a fair
trial, and our law accordingly sets forth serious consequences
if the rules are not followed. I trust you understand and
appreciate the importance of following the rules, and in accord
with your oath and promise, I know you will do so.
During the trial, it may be necessary for me to confer
with the lawyers out of your hearing with regard to questions
of law or procedure. On some occasions you may be excused from
the courtroom for that reason. I will try to limit these
interruptions as much as possible, but you should remember the
importance of the matter you are here to determine, and should
be patient even though the case may seem to go slowly.
Finally, I permit jurors to take notes, but you do not
have to take notes. Notes are just an aid in your own
recollection. The court reporters in this case record
everything that is said in the courtroom, and any portion of
the testimony can be read back to you here in open court during
your deliberations.



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Mr. Fergenson
If you do take notes, be aware that note-taking might
distract you from something important that is happening on the
witness stand. Whether or not you take notes, rely on your own
recollection, and don't be influenced by the fact that another
juror has taken notes.
I just told you that you are to report any attempt by
anyone to improperly influence you. Lawyers are not permitted
to have any contact with you other than what takes place on the
record in this courtroom. If you see an attorney, for an
example, in the hallway or outside and the attorney does not
say hello or acknowledge your presence, please don't think that
the attorney is being rude. The attorneys simply are not
permitted to have that type of contact with you.
Now Assistant United States Attorney Micah Fergenson
will make his opening statement.
MR. FERGENSON: This case is about how the defendant,
Miles Guo, conned thousands of investors out of $1 billion, and
it's about how he spent millions of dollars of victim money on
himself.
In online videos, the defendant pitched investments in
a series of companies. In these videos, the defendant said
many false and misleading things. But at its core, the
defendant's fraud was simple. He promised his victims they'd
get rich, that their investments were safe, and they would not
lose any money. He told them that, as an ultra-rich



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Mr. Fergenson
billionaire, he would personally guarantee and pay back any
losses. He assured them he would never, ever let their
investments be stolen. These were lies. The truth is that the
defendant took investor money and spent it on
himself——million-dollar cars, yachts, a mansion. Miles Guo ran
a simple con, on a grand scale. He lived a billionaire's
lifestyle using money he stole from people he tricked and
cheated.
Now the defendant couldn't run a con this size alone.
You'll learn that the defendant and his partners in crime built
a criminal enterprise of different companies to carry out this
fraud. Some of the companies had offices right here in New
York City. The employees called the defendant the boss, and
the principal. And the defendant and his inner circle used
these businesses to steal money from their victims and to spend
it on themselves. And that's why we're here today, because
when the defendant conned people out of their money, he
committed several crimes involving fraud. When he and his
partners moved around investor money to hide that they were
spending it on themselves, they committed money laundering
crimes. And because the defendant committed these crimes,
using a criminal enterprise, a group of people and companies he
controlled, he committed a racketeering offense, a RICO
conspiracy.
Ladies and gentlemen, in this opening statement, I'm



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Mr. Fergenson
going to tell you what the evidence at this trial will show and
how the government is going to prove it——prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.
So first, what will the evidence show? For years the
defendant deceived thousands of people and stole their money to
pay for a lifestyle he could no longer afford. You see, the
defendant used to be a wealthy real estate developer in China.
But he left China and came to the United States. Eventually
the defendant spoke out against China's government, the Chinese
Communist Party, or the CCP for short. He began giving
interviews and broadcasting his own videos.
And he didn't talk just about the CCP. The defendant
also talked about how rich he was. He showed off his
$70 million apartment on Central Park, or his $30 million
yacht.
And the defendant's mix of showing off wealth and
criticizing the CCP was popular. He became an internet
celebrity in the Chinese community. He had thousands of
followers. And you're going to learn that the CCP didn't like
this, that the CCP tried to silence the defendant, even tried
to have him brought back to China. And you'll learn that the
governments of China and Hong Kong seized the defendant's
assets shortly before the schemes began. So the defendant
needed money.
Now you're going to learn that the defendant pitched



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Mr. Fergenson
many different investment schemes to his victims, but each one
was just a new spin on the same simple fraud. The defendant
told his followers that their money would be used for an
investment, and they could not lose any money. And instead,
the defendant stole the victims' money and spent it on himself.
He did that through four main schemes——GTV; the farm loans;
G/CLUBS; and the Himalaya Exchange. I'm going to talk about
each of those schemes in turn.
So the first business that the defendant raised money
for was GTV. What was GTV? It was an online media company
with a website and an app that had the defendant's videos, his
broadcasts on it. What did the defendant tell his followers
about GTV? He told them it was their special opportunity to
get rich without any risk. In 2020, the defendant announced,
in his online broadcast, that he would let his followers buy
GTV stock. The defendant told his followers that investing in
GTV had no risk. He told them he would personally pay back any
losses. He told them that investing in GTV could only make
them money. These were lies. And the defendant even lied
about the most basic part of the GTV investment——that the money
raised from GTV investors would be used for GTV, to grow the
business of GTV. Even that basic promise was a lie.
But the defendant's followers trusted him, and money
poured in. In months, victims invested over $400 million in
GTV.



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Mr. Fergenson
What did the defendant actually do with that money?
Almost immediately, just days after the fundraising for GTV
closed, the defendant took $100 million of GTV investor money
and used it for a high-risk investment on behalf of his son.
He essentially made a bet using $100 million of GTV investor
money, sent it to a hedge fund for an extremely risky
investment. This bet wasn't even made on behalf of GTV; it was
made in the name of a company owned by the defendant's son.
And guess what? The hedge fund bet didn't pay out. This hedge
fund bet lost $30 million. The defendant told GTV investors
that he would personally guarantee their money and pay back any
losses. Did he pay back the $30 million loss? No. That was
just a lie.
What was GTV? It was one way that Miles Guo lied to
take other people's money. But it wasn't the only way.
There's GTV and then the farm loan scheme.
Now farms, these farms didn't have anything to do with
farming or agriculture. The defendant used the word "farms" to
refer to online groups of his followers in different cities or
countries. And the farm loan scheme was just a way to continue
the GTV scheme. You see, almost right away, US regulators
began investigating what GTV was doing. Funds were frozen, and
GTV's bank accounts were shut down. But the defendant, he
didn't stop. Instead, in his broadcasts, the defendant blamed
these problems on the Chinese government. He claimed that



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Mr. Fergenson
victims who were complaining about their money being stolen
were traitors and CCP spies.
And the defendant told his followers they could still
buy GTV stock; they just couldn't call it stock. Instead,
investors could use "loans" that would be organized through the
farms. You see, each farm opened bank accounts that were used
to collect and pool money from farm members, the investors.
The defendant told his followers that to get GTV stock, they
could enter a "loan agreement" with a farm and send their money
to that farm. He said the farm would then enter a loan
agreement with GTV, and after a few years, the defendant's
followers, the farm members, could choose whether to get GTV
stock or cash. But that was another lie. The defendant and
his money launderer stole the farm loan money for themselves,
and the victims got nothing.
GTV, then the farm loan scheme. What were the farm
loans? They were another way that Miles Guo lied to take other
people's money.
The next scam was G/CLUBS. Now G/CLUBS was supposedly
a high-end lifestyle membership club, but really, it was
another way for the defendant to sell stock without calling it
stock. The defendant told his followers that by paying
G/CLUBS' initial membership fee, they would get stock in GTV or
G Fashion, the defendant's clothing company. How much was the
initial membership fee? The initial fee started at $10,000 and



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Mr. Fergenson
went up to $50,000 on the high end. Thousands of the
defendant's followers paid this fee, sending G/CLUBS hundreds
of millions of dollars and expecting to receive stock in
return. But G/CLUBS members did not get stock. That was
another lie.
Did members get anything for their membership costing
tens of thousands of dollars? The main thing they got was a
discount at G Fashion, which sold expensive clothing to the
defendant's followers, like an $800 pair of sweatpants. You
could get 10 percent off that price if you paid $10,000 for a
G/CLUBS membership. And while G/CLUBS members did not get
stock or any benefit worth tens of thousands of dollars, the
defendant spent the G/CLUBS membership money on himself and his
family.
GTV, farm loans, G/CLUBS. What was G/CLUBS? It was
another way that Miles Guo lied to take other people's money.
Now the defendant didn't just pitch stock to his
followers; he also pitched a pair of cryptocurrencies sold on
the Himalaya Exchange. At first he called them G Coin and G
Dollar, then they became H Coin and H Dollar——H Coin for
Himalaya Coin, H Dollar for Himalaya Dollar. These
cryptocurrencies were another scam. In his broadcast, the
defendant told his typical lies about this cryptocurrency,
guaranteeing investors would not lose money. He told his
followers that H Coin was backed 20 percent by gold. Ladies



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Mr. Fergenson
and gentlemen, H Coin was not backed by gold.
The defendant tricked his followers into buying H Coin
and H Dollar because he wanted more money. You see, the only
place you could buy H Coin or H Dollar was a supposed
cryptocurrency exchange called the Himalaya Exchange. But the
Himalaya Exchange was run by the defendant's money launderer;
same one who helped him steal the farm loan money. You're
going to learn that when the defendant was in a bind and needed
money, the defendant's money launderer sent $37 million of
Himalaya Exchange money—-real dollars, not H dollars——to get
the defendant out of the bind he was in. $37 million of money
that victims sent to the Himalaya Exchange used for his
benefit.
GTV, farm loans, G/CLUBS, the Himalaya Exchange.
What was the Himalaya Exchange? It was one more way
that Miles Guo lied to take other people's money.
These four schemes were really just different versions
of the same con, where the defendant tricked people out of
their money so he could spend it on himself and his family.
And he did it for greed. He used investor money to pay for a
luxury yacht, for private jets, to buy luxury cars, a
Lamborghini that cost nearly a million dollars, a Bugatti that
cost $4 million, a $4 million Ferrari for his son, a second
luxury yacht, a 50,000-square-foot mansion that he paid
millions more to renovate for himself and his family, and to



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Mr. Fergenson
buy things like a $35,000 mattress, and a $60,000 TV. And the
victims, the investors whose funds were stolen by the defendant
to fund these spending sprees? They got nothing. They just
lost money——money they had saved, money they had borrowed,
their family money, money they thought was safe. And he just
stole it.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, objection.
THE COURT: Overruled.
MS. SHROFF: This is opening statement.
THE COURT: Overruled.
MR. FERGENSON: That's what the evidence is going to
show.
Now how is the government going to prove it, prove to
you that the defendant is guilty? You're going to see and hear
several different types of evidence. You will hear the
defendant's own words. You will see the defendant lie on video
over and over. You'll see him lie and say that his victims
can't lose money, that he would pay back any losses, that he
would never spend investor money on himself. And you'll hear
him lie about what he did with investor money, saying that he
has not touched even a penny of it, and admitting that if he
did, it would be a crime.
You'll also hear what the defendant and his
co-conspirators said on phone calls when they didn't know they
were being recorded by a concerned employee. You will hear the



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Mr. Fergenson
defendant order his co-conspirators to transfer $100 million of
investor money that he later used to buy his mansion. And
you're going to see records related to each of the four main
frauds, about how the investor money was supposed to be used,
and then you'll see records showing how it was actually used,
bank records showing how the defendant and his co-conspirators
used dozens of shell companies and hundreds of bank accounts to
conceal the fact they were spending investor money on
themselves.
You'll see the GTV investment document that says GTV
investor money would be used to grow GTV's business, and then
you'll see the records showing $100 million of GTV investor
money going instead to a hedge fund bet for the defendant's
son.
You'll see the farm loan contracts given to victims,
pieces of paper that were ultimately worth nothing to them.
You'll see the bank records showing that farm loan money was
just stolen.
And you'll see photographs of the things the defendant
bought with G/CLUBS membership money, all while promising in
his recorded broadcast that G/CLUBS memberships were a way to
invest in GTV or G Fashion. You'll see photographs of the
G/CLUBS Lamborghini that was parked in the defendant's garage,
at his Connecticut home; photographs of the defendant's mansion
in New Jersey, paid for with G/CLUBS money. You'll see



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Mr. Fergenson
photographs of the defendant's custom Italian suits hanging in
his bedroom closet at that mansion.
You'll see the bank records showing the $37 million
transfer of Himalaya Exchange money for the defendant's
personal benefit, all while the defendant told investors in
recorded broadcasts that he had no ownership in the Himalaya
Exchange and that H Coin and H Dollar money was secure.
Now you'll also hear the testimony of witnesses. You
will hear from people who used to work for and used to trust
the defendant. You'll hear from former employees of the
defendant's G businesses. They will tell you that the
defendant and his co-conspirators ran and controlled those
businesses, and made the decisions about how money was spent
and where it was transferred.
Now some of these former employees are testifying
pursuant to what's called non-prosecution agreements, in which
the government has agreed not to prosecute them in exchange for
their testifying at this trial. So you should listen carefully
to the testimony of these witnesses. When you do, you'll see
it's consistent with all the other evidence in the case.
Ladies and gentlemen, you will also hear from victims
of the defendant's fraud, people who were drawn into Miles
Guo's online world, people who trusted Miles Guo, who believed
the lies he told them, and who lost money, sometimes their life
savings, as a result, people who eventually realized they were



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
being scammed.
Now the evidence, it's not going to come in all at
once. You'll see it witness by witness, document by document,
one piece at a time. But at the end of this trial, after
you've heard the testimony and you've seen the evidence, you
will see the full picture. This man conned thousands of
investors and stole $1 billion.
At the end of the trial, we'll have a chance to speak
with you again. Between now and then, I'm going to ask you
just to do three things——first, pay close attention to the
evidence; second, follow Judge Torres's instructions on the
law; and third, use your common sense——the same common sense
and good judgment that you use every day in your lives as New
Yorkers. If you do those three things, you will reach the only
verdict that is consistent with the evidence and the law——the
defendant is guilty.
THE COURT: Now we will have the opening statement on
behalf of the defendant, Mr. Guo, by Ms. Sabrina Shroff.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you, your Honor.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. It
was not a bet. It was not a scheme. It was not a con. It was
none of those things. And the reason we are here today is not
because the government brought an indictment; the reason we are
here today is because Mr. Guo has pleaded not guilty to the
indictment, and the evidence in this case will show——all of the



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
evidence——the witnesses that they bring in, as government
counsel noted, one by one, the documents that come in one by
one, will lead you to only one conclusion, and the conclusion
is that Mr. Guo is not guilty of the 12 counts brought in this
indictment.
I am here to tell you why there is no conspiracy, RICO
or otherwise, and there is no enterprise. Mr. Guo is not
guilty of the charges in this indictment.
Before I do that, and before I speak more to what the
evidence will show in this case, please allow me to introduce
myself. My name is Sabrina Shroff. And I, along with my
colleagues, represent Miles Guo.
Miles Guo is one of eight children who started life
with very little, born and raised in China, and that is in fact
where he and his brothers and his family made a fortune in real
estate. The evidence in this case will show that the fortune
was humungous. And yes, the government would like you to draw
many, many negative inferences from a person who, according to
them, spent thousands of dollars on a TV or on a mattress. I
ask you please, when you consider the evidence, consider the
evidence within the context and not to be drawn in by the
government's invitation to make judgment calls about people who
have money and spend it in a way that you and I simply
wouldn't.
So let's talk about what the evidence in this case



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
will show. The evidence in this case will show how Miles Guo,
filled with a determination to accomplish a goal, he had a
goal, and how he worked on that goal over a period of years,
and the goal was to establish, to set up, to form, and to move
forward a movement——a movement that would allow the people of
China, the Chinese people, to know that there was an
alternative, an alternative to the Chinese Communist Party, and
how the Chinese Communist Party could be removed so that
everybody could live in a way that they chose to live.
Mr. Guo, the evidence will show, did not have criminal
intent, and when the evidence in this case is complete, you
will see that what the government is trying to string together
is not just a group of people to try and prove to you an
existence of a conspiracy that really doesn't exist, but also
asking you to make value judgments about how money is made and
how money is spent.
So let me start where the government had started. Let
me talk about what the government spent the majority of the
time today, and what the government will spend a majority of
the time throughout this case on, the one person they ask you
to convict——Miles Guo.
He was raised in China, one of eight boys, and each
one of them grew up from nothing and made a fortune in real
estate. The real estate fortune of the eight brothers in China
was not just worth millions, it was worth hundreds and hundreds



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
of millions of dollars. And you will hear that despite this
incredible success, financial fortune that he had in China,
Mr. Guo left China and came eventually and settled down in New
York. And you will ask yourself and the evidence will show why
Mr. Guo left China. He left China because he'd taken on the
CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, and they were not pleased
with him at all. The Chinese Communist Party also had a goal,
and they were very determined to make sure their goal was met.
Their goal was to make sure Miles Guo stopped speaking about
the CCP.
Now you've heard from government counsel earlier
today, and he has certainly invited you to make moral
judgments, value judgments, all sorts of judgments, but what he
has asked you to do at his core, he's asked you to receive from
him almost a fiat that Mr. Guo lied. He wants you to accept
that Mr. Guo lied so that people would give him money and then
wants you to accept that the only thing he did with that money
is spent it on himself and his family. That is not this case,
and that is not true.
You are going to hear that, like almost every one of
us, there's more than one aspect to Miles Guo, and some of the
aspects and some of the things you will hear during the
testimony in this case will be both surprising and eye opening.
So when you evaluate the evidence that comes in through the
witnesses, when you think about Miles Guo's story, when you



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
think about who Miles Guo is, I ask you, keep in mind and
conceptualize the world that he lived in because it is not our
world. Our world is not filled with surveillance, constant
harassment, and constant oversight and disruption by the
Chinese Communist Party.
You will hear testimony in this case from government
witnesses that Mr. Guo was forced to leave China. He was
forced to leave behind his wife and his daughter. Both were
arrested and detained in prisons in China for almost two years.
You will learn and you will have evidence that shows
you that once Mr. Guo got to New York, instead of focusing on
all the negatives that were before him and all the hurdles he
had to face, what he did is, he started to and continued over
time to speak out against the Chinese Communist party, and that
is what he did all the time, all day long. That was his goal,
to get that story out. And repeatedly he said——and you will
hear it through the trial——that the people of China are not the
Communist party. That is what he wanted to tell the people
that were here in the United States and the good-thinking
people that he had to leave behind in China.
What is it that he set out to do? He set out to start
a movement and tell the truth about the CCP. And with that, he
started to speak, he started to write, and he started to
broadcast, and soon that came to be known amongst those who
believed him and amongst those who followed him to be the



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
Whistleblower Movement.
And what did he talk about? He talked about things
that he knew. He knew of the corruption in the CCP, and that's
what he talked about. He knew certain secrets of corrupt
government officials, and that's what he talked about,
specifically. What else did he know? He knew the many ways in
which the CCP worked, and he knew of the many, many ways that
the CCP could make one's life hell, and one's professional life
and one's business life and one's personal life.
Now once Mr. Guo started talking about the CCP, the
reaction to it was immediate and strong, and the reaction
wasn't just from the people who were enthralled by what he had
to say. There was another reaction too. There was a reaction
by the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, and they too had a
goal. Their goal was to make sure that he stopped.
So you see that most vividly when Mr. Guo, and the
evidence will show, had a broadcast on April of 2017,
April 19th of 2017, when he starts and gives a live interview
on Voice of America. In face of relentless bullying by the CCP
to stop, to be quiet, Mr. Guo decided to have a live-feed
interview on April 19th. The interview was, and his goal was,
to broadcast in an uncensored, live manner so that nobody could
doctor what he had to say. And what happened to this live
interview? While he's still speaking, in mid-speech, the feed
is cut off, the line is cut off, and the interview is stopped.



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
There is no warning. There is no notice. All of a sudden, all
of the work he had put in to make sure this interview goes
through, it's cut off. And what happens after that? What
happens after that also gives you a context about the world in
which Mr. Guo has to live and do business.
Immediately after the April 19th interview, the
Chinese Communist Party issues what is called a red notice.
That is——a red notice is a warrant through the Interpol,
seeking Mr. Guo's immediate arrest and extradition back to
China.
After that interview with Voice of America, his wife
and his daughter are arrested in China by the Chinese police.
He loses all access to social media. His YouTube account is
cut off. His Twitter is cut off. And he has no access
whatsoever to any methodology by which he can get his word out.
What else do they cut off access to? They cut off
access to any method by which he could get himself or his
businesses any help. The CCP hacked his phones. Every
cellphone he has, they hacked. They hacked his computers——his
home computers and his work computers. They even hacked the
home and work computers of other people who are either
assisting him or doing business with him. And this pattern of
harassment by the CCP——and the evidence will show all of this
pattern——escalates and becomes more and more sophisticated.
So let me give you an example of how sophisticated



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
this harassment can get.
At one point the CCP is so determined to shut down any
and every bank account that the CCP starts to send money into
these accounts in the names of people who are on the OFAC list.
The OFAC list is a list set by the United States government
that lists the names of people who have engaged in criminal
conduct and are not allowed to use our banking system. The CCP
uses those names to send in money, triggers a reaction from the
compliance people in the bank, the bank shuts down all of his
accounts, because the monies being wired, they think, are in
the name of known criminals on the OFAC list.
You will hear all of this evidence from the government
witnesses, and you will know that the CCP has a thousand
different ways to mess with Miles Guo and to try and stop the
political movement that was really the essence of his entire
being.
The evidence will show why Mr. Guo continued,
continued in this movement, and why he endeavored to overcome
each and every one of these hurdles. He was determined to make
sure the movement survived, and he wanted to make sure others
who wanted to join the movement were able to do so.
So what did Mr. Guo do? He set up the Rule of Law
Foundation and he set up the Rule of Law Society. He dedicated
both those entities to make sure that they provided people with
support to fight the propaganda given by the CCP. To give



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
voice to the movement, he created a social media company. The
government lawyer has spoken endlessly about it. GTV. What
was GTV? GTV was a real company set up to spread the message
of the Whistleblower Movement. The point of GTV was to get an
uncensored voice out, not to just the people of Chinese beliefs
and systems who lived in the United States, but also the many,
many people who were left behind in China, who also wanted to
be part of that movement. And that is what GTV offered them.
Yes, GTV was the first of multiple business opportunities that
aimed to spread the voice of the Whistleblower Movement.
Mr. Guo participated in GTV, the farm loan program, G/CLUBS,
and the Himalaya Exchange, and its currencies, H Coin and H
Dollar. These businesses were at the heart of the movement,
and the government is simply wrong when it argues that they
were not real businesses. The evidence in this trial will show
that GTV was, unlike many, many others, a citizen-based
journalism website. It allowed for people to speak openly and
talk to each other without repercussions from the CCP.
The farm loan program. The farm loan program, the
evidence will show, not what this prosecutor has just told you,
but it will show that the farm loan program was a way for
people to give their money at an interest rate to support the
movement——the movement that they were interested in. And it
was a way for people to earn money from these loans. I remind
you, keep an eye on the time frame when all of this happened.



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
United States and most of the world is in the midst of a
pandemic, and people are eager to interact with each other
online.
What was G/CLUBS? G/CLUBS was what the government
lawyer here mocks whether or not one should spend X amount of
dollars on a sweatshirt or sweatpants——I think he said
sweatpants. That is a person's choice, and that is exactly
what China didn't want people to have and what the movement did
want people to have——choice. You want to spend your money that
way, that is entirely up to you. And what did G/CLUBS
membership allow? It allowed a person, if they wanted, to
support the movement, at whatever price they wanted to support
it. If you wanted to support it at the $10,000 level, you
could, and if you wanted to support it at the $50,000 level,
you could. The evidence will show——and I ask you, when the
evidence comes in, do not take that invitation to make a moral
or value judgment on what and how people should spend their
money. The question is, does the evidence show the existence
of real companies, the existence of real employees, the
existence of people who did actual, real good work, the
existence of people who dealt with the same problems you and I
deal with at our jobs, trying to do the best job we can because
we're chosen by people and bosses, because we have talent,
expertise, and hard work, and those are the people that worked
in each one of these companies.



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
There is no denying at all that all of these entities
were built around Mr. Guo's celebrity. Yes. And he was the
one who started speaking as early as 2017 and continued
speaking against the CCP.
You know what else the evidence will show? That not
just other people were the ones who invested. Mr. Guo's
friends invested, Mr. Guo's family members invested. Why?
Because they too——they too believed in the movement. So they
invested. They invested in GTV, they invested in the farm,
they invested in G/CLUBS, and they invested on the Himalaya
Exchange. They believed. The evidence will show that these
companies were built, were put together, just like any other
business; maybe not with the same level of infrastructure, but
people believed. And Mr. Guo, like many, many of us, had a
vision, had an idea. What he did not quite have is the
infrastructure that you and I bring to our daily lives. When
he first started, he spoke very little or no English. He was
new to this country. He wasn't familiar with the way things
are done. And yes, you will hear recordings in which he speaks
in a demanding voice, one instant, for work to get completed,
and at some times even appears to be extremely pigheaded in a
way that many a person is. Does that mean he's a criminal?
No. Does that mean he committed these crimes? The evidence
will show it does not. What the evidence, again, will show is
that the people who he hired were people who were able to



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
contribute to each one of these businesses.
Now the government, I suppose, will spend some amount
of time introducing evidence about two individuals, Yvette Wang
and William Je, and I ask you, as you hear the evidence the
government puts in, to pay some and close attention to what
roles each one of these people played. The testimony will show
that Ms. Wang was the head of operations. She ran the
day-to-day of each business. She was in charge of hiring. She
did the best to hire people, and her hiring practices were the
same as yours or mine. She hired people that she met along the
way in her business, she hired people through a headhunter when
she needed a person or a spot filled. And she was no more or
no less committed and no more or no less demanding than any
other chief executive officer that works.
William Je is another name that the evidence will
show, and William Je was the finance guy. He's a well-regarded
investment banker who had managed the fortune not just of the
Guo family fund but he had managed the fortunes of many another
companies. He had expertise, he had skill, and that is why he
was the finance guy.
And I've already talked at length about Mr. Guo, who
was the ideas man. He came up with the ideas and he put
together the thought and the vision of what the movement that
he believed in would look like.
So you see, he wasn't alone in the movement. He



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
wasn't moving all on his own. In fact, that's why it was
called the Whistleblower Movement. The point of it was to have
others join and participate.
So what will the evidence show at the end of the day?
The evidence will show that each one of these companies hired
and had people working towards the existence of a real
business. They believed and Mr. Guo believed. Mr. Guo
believed in this movement. So when the government lawyer asks
you and tells you to believe that Mr. Guo defrauded the members
of this movement, what the government is saying to you is that
he intentionally misled supporters to steal money, the same
money that they had given to the movement, the movement that he
had devoted almost his entire life to, the movement for which
he fled China, the movement for which he put up with being
followed every day, the movement for which his phones were
hacked, the movement for which his wife and his daughter sat in
prison for two years, and the movement for which he was not
allowed to leave and travel outside the United States, the
movement for which he risked his very existence. That's what
they're saying he set out to harm. They're saying that he set
out to harm the very thing that was almost an extension, a
symbiotic extension of who he was. And he did all of that even
though he had a fortune from a family fund that allowed him to
live in luxury. What the government is asking you to believe
is not just illogical; it defies common sense.



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
I ask you to consider this. All of the evidence that
the government lawyer talked about——the wealth, the millions of
dollars' worth of luxury hotel in Manhattan where he lived, the
yacht, the mattress, whatever it is that he talked about——you
know what the evidence is going to show? The evidence is going
to show that no matter what else these witnesses say to you,
Mr. Guo had that lifestyle long before the government even
alleges that he committed this fraud.
The suits, sweatpants, the house, the evidence will
clearly show, that has been his lifestyle for decades, well
before the government says he lost money and well, well before
any of this was even a thought in the government's mind. And
it certainly continues today and continued for days after
because the family fund will always support Mr. Guo.
And I ask you to consider this, because the government
does invite you to make this value judgment. It is easy for a
person to judge another as either shallow or rich, but shallow
or rich does not make for a criminal. That does not mean that
the government's inference is a proper one.
The evidence will clearly show that Mr. Guo did not
need to steal money to buy the Brioni suits. None of that
would be worth all of the hardship he went through to keep the
CCP at bay. What the evidence will show here is that Mr. Guo
did not steal money from GTV, he did not steal money from the
farm loans program, he did not steal money from G/CLUBS, and he



O5O1GUO1 Opening - Ms. Shroff
did not steal money from the Himalaya Exchange.
The government will also invite you to think, and
invite you to conclude, that the reason Mr. Guo did certain
things are because he was engaged in criminal activity.
(Continued on next page)



O5OVGUO2 Opening - Ms. Shroff
MS. SHROFF: So what else is the government going to
elicit in terms of evidence? The government is going to seek
to elicit that Mr. Guo had constant telephones that he changed;
he had almost hundreds and hundreds of telephones. And that he
had these telephones, and he changed his number constantly
because he didn't want people to know what he was doing.
I ask you to consider this: If you have been the
target of constant hacking by the CCP, and if you have been the
target of people listening in on your phones, using your voice
recordings to impersonate you, wouldn't you also change your
phones that often?
If you were in constant fear of being threatened,
kidnapped, killed, moved, would you also not have a car that
does not tell people where and when you're going to be taken?
It's logical that that is what a person who is being surveilled
would live in that manner. If you were Mr. Guo and you were
being constantly targeted, wouldn't you want a safe and secure
place to have business meetings? Wouldn't you establish a base
where people you wanted to do business with could come and meet
with you without the interference and the distortion from the
CCP?
For every piece of evidence of wealth that they put
in, you will have an equally fair inference that he took those
steps not to cheat, not to indulge, but to make sure that the
movement survived despite the distortions of the CCP.



O5OVGUO2 Opening - Ms. Shroff
I ask you to keep in mind when they talk to you about
bank accounts, Mahwah, homes, ask yourself, why would a person
have to open a bank account, unless, of course, each time a
bank account was owned, somebody from the OFAC list deposited
money into your account and had compliance to them. That's the
reason why Mr. Guo's actions must be evaluated in the context
and the lifestyle in which he was supposed to exist.
So the government will introduce the evidence. And I
ask you to keep in mind that for each piece of evidence that
comes into them, the necessary inference from them is not the
accurate one. They ask you to infer from the filing of a
bankruptcy that Mr. Guo simply did not have money.
Now, whether we think it's fair or whether we think it
unfair, the rich often declare bankruptcy. Personal bankruptcy
does not mean poverty. None of that inference is correct. And
I ask you, when you hear evidence of that, to consider how it
is that Mr. Guo, who did not have any personal assets at that
time, because the CCP was the one that had seized his property.
There was a time — and you will hear evidence coming
in — that Mr. Guo was to pay a fine of almost $100 million
within a few days. And that is what leads to a filing of
bankruptcy. But the government's request that from that you
draw the conclusion of guilt, again, is a misplaced request.
The government will argue throughout this case that
what Mr. Guo did was simply unlawful. They will ask you to say



O5OVGUO2

you can be persecuted and you can still be a fraud. And when
they ask you that, I ask you to think about how the evidence
shows them to be wrong. The government isn't just saying that
there is a fraud. What the government is asking you to do is
to conclude that Mr. Guo defrauded essentially himself because
he is the movement, and the movement him.
So when they ask you to take a look at the evidence
that comes in — the evidence of wealth, the evidence of
spending, the evidence of luxury — I ask you to evaluate all of
that evidence in the context which I have described. And if
you do so, and if you evaluate the evidence, understanding how
difficult it was for these entities to survive, and how each
one of the people who worked for these entities worked hard to
maintain and forward a movement, you will reach the only
logical conclusion in this case: That Mr. Guo is not guilty of
the 12 counts of the indictment. Thank you.
THE COURT: Members of the jury, I want to remind you
about our trial schedule. Every day, every weekday, you'll be
entering the courtroom at 9:30 in the morning. By 9 o'clock,
you'll have a light breakfast available to you, so you can come
early. But you must be ready to enter the courtroom at 9:30.
So, in general, we'll take a half-hour break between
11:30 and 12; and I will also have a light lunch for you. And
then we'll go until 2:45. By condensing the schedule this way,
I don't take up your entire day until 5 p.m. I'm very aware



O5OVGUO2

that you have other important things to do during the day, and
so that is why I've designed the schedule in this way.
So at this time we will take our half-of-an-hour
break.
(Jury not present)
THE COURT: You may be seated. Counsel, is there
anything before we return in half of an hour?
MR. FERGENSON: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: You're ready with your first witness?
MR. FERGENSON: Yes, your Honor.
MR. KAMARAJU: Not from the defense, your Honor.
THE COURT: All righty.

remember his number, his actual number on the jury.
MR. KAMARAJU: It makes sense that he's an alternate.
MR. BARKAN: 192 is Alternate 5, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay. Alternate 5.
To the Honorable A. Torres:
I am profoundly disappointed that my excuse for
dismissal wasn't granted. My request began with I am a working
single father. My child will have field trips, Father's Day,
tea ceremony, and graduation. And I will now not be able to
attend. When school ends on June 18th, I will not be able to
take her to camp. My family is far away and not able to assist
regularly. I am a widower. My wife passed away in childbirth.
So being able to something my child is very important.
I've just learned about the need to gather at a
location at an agreed-upon time. I dropped my child off at 8
a.m. Any adjustments brought in will cost me, my family, and
job gravely, not to mention thousands of dollars. I did not
detail my work position and how I am required to be at my job.
I thought my reasonable request based on my home and living
situation would have been sufficient.
To the attorneys, I appreciate the confidence you have



O5OVGUO2

in my selection. You have royally screwed me over.
Juror No. 192.
MS. SHROFF: He's the gentlemen who served on Judge
McMahon's jury. I think he said that when he was being voir
dired.
THE COURT: What would you like me to do?
MS. SHROFF: I say we let him go. We have six; we can
live with five.
MR. FINKEL: So, your Honor, the government is fine
with five alternates. However, we defer to the Court on the
appropriateness on how to deliver the message. And the
government's concern would be sending a message to the rest of
the jury that merely sending a letter to the Court would allow
them to be excused from service.
The government has no objection to proceeding with
five alternates; and just ask the Court to use its discretion
and its experience on how to -- the timing of how to deliver
the message.
THE COURT: So I am also told that the jurors are not
pleased with the arrangement that they meet at a pick-up point
and be taken by car to the courthouse. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXwhich I think is acceptable.
MR. KAMARAJU: Fine with us, your Honor.
THE COURT: So this juror, Alternate No. 5, does not



O5OVGUO2

know about that offered alternative yet. I could always bring
him in and ask him if that change would make it acceptable to
him, see what he says.
MS. SHROFF: We leave it up to the Court, if the Court
wants to ask him. But he seems royally, as he puts it, pissed
off. So my inclination would be to let him go. But perhaps
the Court could consider if we just let him sit through the day
and then we let him know just not to come on Monday, and then
assume that -- either tell the jury that, you know, this is the
new pool and provide no explanation, so that they don't think
somebody got away with something.
THE COURT: I definitely will have him sit through the
day, and I will speak with him after we're finished for the
day. Okay.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, one application before we
leave. Just that the location where the jurors are going to
meet be sealed in public record for the reasons that the
government stated in its motion, and that the location where
the jurors are going to meet not be shared with the defendant.
THE COURT: I think that that is totally appropriate.
MS. SHROFF: We don't even know where they were going
to meet, so we have nothing to share.
THE COURT: Okay. So those items will be sealed.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, your Honor.

DIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Good afternoon.
A. Good afternoon.
Q. Where do you work?
A. I'm a special agent with the FBI in the New Haven field
office.



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
Q. How long have you been with the FBI?
A. 26 years.
Q. What, if anything, did you do before you were an FBI agent?
A. I was an auto underwriter with State Farm.
Q. Special Agent McNamara, what is ERT?
A. It's an evidence response team.
Q. Can you please describe to the members of the jury what the
evidence response team does.
A. Sure. Evidence response teams, they are bureau-wide. They
are people who are additionally trained in crime scene
management and forensic evidence collection.
Q. Special Agent McNamara, what role, if any, do you have with
ERT?
A. I'm the senior team leader for the New Haven team.
Q. What is a search warrant?
A. A search warrant is a document that's obtained from a
judge, usually an investigator gets it. It explains what it is
that you are allowed to search and what it is that you are
allowed to search for and seize.
Q. Special Agent McNamara, I want to direct your attention to
March 15th, 2023. In connection with your role at ERT, what,
if anything, did you do that day?
A. We executed a search warrant at 373 Taconic Road in
Greenwich, Connecticut.
Q. What sort of neighborhood is Greenwich, Connecticut?



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
A. It's a very affluent neighborhood.
Q. How would you describe 373 Taconic Road?
A. It's beautiful, beautiful mansion. Very large, beautiful
yard, pool, tennis courts. And I believe it even bordered a
golf course.
MR. FINKEL: Ms. Loftus, we can display for the
witness what's been marked for identification as GX 133.
Q. Special Agent McNamara, what is GX 133?
A. That's an aerial view of 373 Taconic Road in Greenwich.
Q. Is that a fair and accurate photograph of 373 Taconic Road
in Greenwich?
A. Yes.
MR. FINKEL: Government offers 133.
THE COURT: No objection?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
THE COURT: Admitted.
(Government's Exhibit 133 received in evidence)
MR. FINKEL: If we could publish it, please,
Ms. Loftus.
Q. Special Agent McNamara, was the weather the day that you
were at 373 Taconic the same as what we see on the screen?
A. No, there was snow on the ground.
Q. Approximately what time did you arrive at 373 Taconic on
March 15th?
A. Around 7 a.m.



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
Q. And when you arrived, did the FBI have a search warrant?
A. Yes.
Q. For what?
A. For 373 Taconic Road and its grounds.
Q. Did the FBI have an arrest warrant that day?
A. Yes.
Q. For who?
A. Miles Guo.
Q. Was Miles Guo present at 373 Taconic?
A. No.
Q. Were there individuals besides FBI personnel present at 373
Taconic?
A. Yes, there were three residents. There were an older
female, a younger female, and a male. And my understanding was
it was the wife, daughter, and the daughter's boyfriend.
Q. Wife, daughter, and daughter's boyfriend of whom?
A. Of Mr. Guo.
Q. What were their names?
MS. SHROFF: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may state that. You may
answer.
A. The daughter was Mei --
MS. SHROFF: May we approach for a moment, please?
THE COURT: All right.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you.



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
(At sidebar)
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, the daughter's name is
immaterial. She has been the subject of a lot of online and
offline harassment. She's not even in court today because she
does not want to be identified. She has made no court
appearances, even though she's dedicated to her father, because
she is constantly harangued.
We have not once raised an objection to their
witnesses names not being disclosed. And there is no relevance
to what her name is. It's not pertinent at all to any
questioning here. Her name could be Sonia Gandhi, for all I
care, but her real name does not need to be used.
MR. FINKEL: It is pertinent because her name is on
documents, as is the name of the wife, as is the name of the
daughters, boyfriend or fiancé.
In addition, I should note it is relevant here.
Ms. Shroff opened on the fact of the wife and the daughter and
their relationship with him. Her name is on documents. We
need to explain who she is. It's relevant.
THE COURT: The harassers already know her name.
MS. SHROFF: She's not here in court. She didn't come
to court to support her father because she's being harassed,
your Honor. And I did not refer to her by name in my opening
for a specific reason, which is obvious why I didn't use the
wife's name and the daughter's name. And I think the record



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
speaks for itself on that point.
THE COURT: So the fact that these names are on
documents makes her name relevant. But also, the Chinese
Communist Party jailed the wife and daughter. I'm sure they
know the name, plus a lot of other information.
The objection is overruled.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, it's not the Chinese
Communist Party, it's quote/unquote victims.
THE COURT: Overruled, Ms. Shroff.
MS. SHROFF: Thank you.
(Continued on next page)



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
(In open court)
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. The daughter was Mei, M-E-I; Guo, G U O. The mother, I
only recall her last name was Ngok, N-G-O-K. And the male, it
was Cao, C-A-O.
Q. Do you remember the male's first name?
A. I do not.
MR. FINKEL: Ms. Loftus, if we can display for the
witness 3514-48. If you can please go to page 2 of that.
Actually, your Honor, may I approach?
THE COURT: You may.
Q. Special Agent McNamara, can you look at your screen towards
the bottom. And the question is whether that refreshes your
recollection as to the daughter's boyfriend's first name?
A. Yes.
MR. FINKEL: Ms. Loftus, can you bring that down,
please.
Q. Special Agent McNamara, what is the daughter's boyfriend's
first name?
A. Defeng, D-E-F-E-N-G.
Q. Special Agent McNamara, what was your role with respect to
the search at 373 Taconic?
A. I was a coordinator. I made sure we had the materials we
needed, assignments as to who would photograph, answer
questions; just sort of made sure that the search kept moving



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
and that everything was completed.
Q. And what were the sort of items that the team was looking
for?
A. Electronics like cell phones, computers, business records,
financial records, photographs, things of that nature.
Q. By the way, Special Agent McNamara, aside from your
involvement in this search on March 15th, were you involved in
the investigation concerning Miles Guo?
A. No.
Q. If you were not involved in the Miles Guo investigation,
can you explain to the members of the jury why, if at all, you
were participating in a search that day?
A. Sure. It was a request by New York. They had multiple
search warrants, so they needed assistance conducting this one.
And since it's in Greenwich, it's in our territory in
Connecticut, so they asked us for assistance. They asked us to
provide people and supplies and things that were needed to
conduct the search.
Q. Does that happen somewhat commonly within the FBI?
A. Yes.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, at this time I'd like to read
a stipulation to the parties.
THE COURT: Go ahead.
Before you read the stipulation though, I'd like to
let the jurors know what a stipulation is.



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
A stipulation is an agreement between both sides to
present evidence to the jury without calling a witness for the
purpose of discussing the subject matter.
Go ahead.
MR. FINKEL: It is hereby stipulated and agreed by the
United States of America and Miles Guo, the defendant:
If called as a witness at trial, a special agent of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, would testify as
follows:
On March 15, 2023, special agents and other FBI
employees executed a judicially authorized search of 373
Taconic Road, Greenwich, Connecticut. During the course of
that search, FBI personnel took photographs of exterior and
interior spaces of 373 Taconic Road, Greenwich, Connecticut,
and also lawfully seized documents and electronic devices.
Government Exhibits GX CT-20 through GX CT-30, GX
CT-35 through GX CT-72, GX CT-74 through GX CT-105 are fair and
accurate photographs of interior and exterior spaces of 373
Taconic Road, Greenwich, Connecticut, that were lawfully
captured by an FBI photographer on March 15, 2023, when
conducting the search.
Following the March 15, 2023 search, FBI personnel
scanned and photographed documents that were lawfully seized
during the search. GX CT-101 through GX CT-129, GX CT-157
through GX CT-187, GX CT-190 through GX CT-202, and GX CT-204



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
through GX CT-207 are true and correct copies of documents that
were seized during the March 15, 2023 search of 373 Taconic
Road, Greenwich, Connecticut.
It is further stipulated and agreed that this
stipulation, which is GX STIP-1, may be received into evidence
as a government exhibit at trial. And it's signed by the
parties.
With that, your Honor, the government offers GX
STIP-1.
THE COURT: It is admitted.
(Government's Exhibit STIP-1 received in evidence)
MR. FINKEL: And the government offers GX CT-20
through GX CT-30, GX CT-35 through 72, GX CT-74 through 105, GX
CT-101 through 129, GX CT-157 through 187, GX CT-190 through
202, and GX CT-204 through 207.
THE COURT: They are admitted.
(Government's Exhibits CT-20 through CT-30, CT-35
through 72, CT-74 through 105, CT-101 through 129, CT-157
through 187, CT-190 through 202, CT-204 through 207 received in
evidence)

MS. SHROFF: Objection. What the FBI generally does
is not relevant.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Yes.
Q. And you said that you reviewed the photographs from the
search. Can you explain what you mean by that?
MS. SHROFF: Objection to the leading.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may continue.
A. So we had -- we maintained a copy of photographs from the
search. When I was asked to come here, I reviewed this to
refresh my memory of the search.
Q. And the photographs that were part of the search, are they
maintained in FBI's records and kept that way?



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
A. Yes.
MS. SHROFF: Objection. She has no personal
knowledge.
THE COURT: Step up.
(Continued on next page)



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
(At sidebar)
THE COURT: So she is familiar with the photographs
from the search.
MR. FINKEL: So, your Honor, she was the team lead and
she's familiar with the ERT, including its recordkeeping
practices. For one, I think she recognizes parts of the
photograph, but that's neither here nor there. She can lay an
803(6) foundation as a photograph that was taken at the search.
She knows it was stored with the other photographs of the
search.
I'll lay that foundation that it was taken by someone
with knowledge of the matter at the time it occurred and kept
in the course of the FBI's business.
It's one photograph. We can lay the foundation.
MS. SHROFF: The government knows full well it has a
problem here. They asked me this morning to stipulate to it
coming into evidence and I declined because they are unable to
lay a foundation. The fact that --
THE COURT: What is wanting in the foundation?
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, number one, she didn't take
the photograph; number two, she didn't view the evidence;
number three, she didn't view that particular scene; number
four, the only reason she's table to testify this way is
because of the government giving her the photos that they took
from other members of the FBI team and showed it to her.



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
She has zero personal knowledge of this particular
photograph. And nothing about a photograph being in an FBI
file falls under the exception of a business record. Either
she has personal knowledge of this or she doesn't, and clearly
she doesn't, your Honor.
Additionally --
THE COURT: Isn't this kept in the regular course of
business?
MS. SHROFF: It doesn't fall within that exception,
because the exception is supposed to capture something that is,
one, a business record, which this is not; this is evidence
gathering. And documents gathered by the FBI are by definition
self-serving because they are prepared in the course of a
litigation. But they do not technically fall within the
business records exception.
Number two, the way this photograph is taken, it is
not a photograph of a scene that is in the home. So what
they've done is they've gone through the entire house, pulled
out all the sunglasses, laid them on a table, and then taken a
photograph. You can see that clearly from the photograph and
from the cases that are stacked up next to them.
So this particular person did not do the underlying
search for the sunglasses, did not place the sunglasses there,
and she has zero personal knowledge of any of this.
THE COURT: But the photograph was taken during the



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
course of the search.
MS. SHROFF: She wouldn't know that. It could have
been this search, it could have been another search, it could
have been a search before that. She doesn't know when this
photograph was taken.
MR. FINKEL: If I may just make a few points.
First of all, if necessary, we can bring another
person to simply authenticate one photograph. The parties have
worked quite well in good faith on stipulating authenticity,
suddenly that changed this morning.
Number one, I believe if I ask the witness, Do you
recognize any components of this photograph, she will say: I
know the door and that was from the room.
A witness does not have to be the one to take a
photograph to get it into evidence. The witness does not have
to be the one to move things around if that's, in fact, what
happened to get it into evidence. If Ms. Shroff wants to cross
her on how the sunglasses were arranged, if that is, in fact,
correct, I don't know, she can do that. It's just an
admissibility question.
THE COURT: So she may be able to testify as to the
door, but she certainly can't testify as to the rest of the
room and how these sunglasses were positioned.
MS. SHROFF: We would have no objection --
MR. FINKEL: Excuse me.



O5OVGUO2 McNamara - Direct
MS. SHROFF: -- to the photo of the door.
MR. FINKEL: Excuse me.
That would be appropriate cross.
This goes to the weight of the document. Excuse me.
This goes to the weight of the document, not to admissibility.
In either case, I can lay an 803(6) foundation. She's familiar
with the case file and she's familiar with how the records are
stored. That's one photograph. I'll just leave it at that.
THE COURT: So she can identify the room, but she
cannot identify these objects.
MR. FINKEL: Okay. So I'll lay an 803(6) foundation.
THE COURT: Okay.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor?
THE COURT: We're done.

(In open court)
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Special Agent McNamara, when a search is conducted by the
FBI, what happens to the photographer's photos?
A. The photographer brings the -- takes the SD card out of the
camera, places it into a tower. It's not a computer, it's a
tower where you just burn -- you can do like four copies at a
time. So that they place that in there. We burn the copies.
The first copy is the original, and that goes into
original envelope of -- original evidence envelope, a 1A
envelope we call it. It gets attached to the file.
The second is the backup copy; that also gets put into
the file.
The third copy is one we would send to the case agent
for a working copy so they wouldn't have to go and remove those
physically from the file to review it.
And if there were items that were being sent to the
lab, we would also burn a copy to send with those items to the
lab for review.
THE COURT: I'd like you to get closer to the
microphone. You can bring it closer, you can sit closer. And
speak up.
Q. And the copies of photographs, which field office, if any,
were they sent to?
A. New York.

CROSS EXAMINATION
BY MS. SHROFF:
Q. Good afternoon, Special Agent.
A. Good afternoon.
Q. Ms. McNamara, before March 15th, did you know anything
about Mr. Miles Guo?
A. No.
Q. And you prepared, I take it, right, to execute the search
on March 15th?
A. Prepared the search supplies and things of that nature,
yes.
Q. Right. And you had a plan in place, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And prior to executing the search, you met with or emailed
with the members of the team that were going to accompany you,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You discussed where Mr. Guo might be on March 15th,
correct?
A. I don't believe so.
Q. You did not discuss where——which one of the three homes you



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
thought he might be in?
A. I don't recall that.
Q. Do you recall, sitting here today, on what date you started
preparing to execute the search?
A. It was either earlier that week or late the prior week. I
believe.
Q. And you emailed, did you not, with other members, including
somebody named Robin, correct?
A. I don't know who Robin is.
Q. Robin Cartwright?
A. Rachel Cartwright.
Q. I'm sorry?
A. Rachel.
Q. Rachel, Robin, you emailed with her, right?
A. Yes. She's the one that requested our assistance.
Q. And in emailing with her, the plan was for her to exchange
information with you and you to exchange information with her,
correct?
A. Information about how we were going to conduct the search,
yes.
Q. Right. And you knew you were going to search a home,
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you knew it was a large home, correct?
A. Yes.



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
Q. And you knew the home could have Mr. Guo in it, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you were planning to arrest Mr. Guo, correct?
A. I was not.
Q. Well, somebody on your team was going to arrest Mr. Guo,
correct?
A. No one on my team does arrests. We simply do searches.
Q. Okay. And you testified earlier that you didn't recall
whether or not you anticipated where Mr. Guo would be, so let
me approach with something that might refresh your
recollection. That would be 3514-24.
Does that refresh your recollection, ma'am, that you
were anticipating Mr. Guo not being in the Connecticut home?
A. No.
Q. And it is fair to say that you interacted via email with
several individuals, all coordinating the search of this place,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's 373——I have trouble pronouncing the
street——Taconic Road; is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you wanted to go there early in the morning, correct?
A. Yeah. I did not choose the time.
Q. Okay. But in any event, you were there before 7:00; is
that fair to say?



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
A. No. We arrived around 7:00.
Q. And it's fair to say that the home itself is not one that
you had access to, correct?
MR. FINKEL: Objection.
A. I don't understand.
THE COURT: Overruled.
MS. SHROFF: I'll rephrase, your Honor.
Q. You couldn't get in through the gate, right? Your team
couldn't get in through the gate, correct?
A. Yes, we could. The gate was open when we arrived.
Q. The gate to the home was open.
A. Yes. When my team arrived, the gate was open.
Q. And how many teams preceded you?
A. The——the team that was doing the entry.
Q. The team that was doing the entry, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And the team that was doing the entry was coordinating with
the team that was following, which is your team, correct?
A. When——when they finished their entry and it was secured,
they let us know that we can then proceed to the location.
Q. Right. And did the team that was doing the entry tell you
that it was Mr. Guo's daughter who let them in?
MR. FINKEL: Objection.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. When you——



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
THE COURT: You don't need to answer.
Q. When you entered the home, did you see Mr. Guo's daughter
and wife seated outside on a bench?
A. No.
Q. When was the first time you saw Mr. Guo's daughter and wife
in that home?
A. Inside the house.
Q. Where were they seated inside the house?
A. I would call it like a family room.
Q. And they were put there by the——by the team that entered
before you, correct?
A. I don't know. I was not there.
Q. You don't know because you weren't there. And when you
entered the house, did you go from room to room in the home?
A. When I first entered the house?
Q. Yes.
A. When I first entered the house, I went towards where the
residents were to find Supervisory Special Agent Cartwright to
let her know that we were there.
Q. Because she was the first entry team, right?
A. I don't know.
Q. You don't know who the first entry team was?
A. I don't know who was on the entry team. I followed the
entry team. That was not part of the search.
Q. So you followed the entry team, correct, and the entry team



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
told you that the location was secure, correct?
A. We were at a staging location. When the entry team told us
it was secure, then we drove to the residence.
Q. And how many of you drove together?
A. I can only speak for my team. There were probably a dozen
of us or so.
Q. You just said you can only speak for your team, correct?
A. Right. You asked who drove together; that's who I drove
with, my team.
Q. Okay. Did any members of your team take any of the
photographs you testified to?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So we'll get to the photographs in a minute. But
let's just stay with your entry into the home, okay? When you
entered the home, it looked, as you said, like a home that was
lived in, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. There was food on the kitchen table, correct?
A. There was food, yes.
Q. Yes. And there were three people in the home, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And the three people were Mr. Guo's wife, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. His daughter, correct?
A. Yes.



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
Q. And his daughter's fiancé, correct?
A. I was told boyfriend, but yes.
Q. Okay. And did you see the boyfriend who was in crutches in
the bedroom or did somebody tell you about that?
A. I'm sorry. Can you repeat that.
Q. Sure. During your search did you see his daughter's
boyfriend?
A. Yes. They were all in that room together.
Q. Okay. And he was on crutches, correct?
A. Oh, crutches, yes. I'm sorry. I misunderstood you.
Q. That's okay. A lot of people misunderstand me.
But he was on crutches, right?
A. Yes, he had crutches with him.
Q. Right. And there were two dogs, two small poodle-like dogs
in the home, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And they had all been placed in that one room, correct?
A. No. I took the daughter upstairs to go get the dogs.
Q. Okay. So you took the daughter upstairs so that she could
retrieve the dogs, and you brought his daughter back down and
put her back in that room, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. And you had them stay there while the rest of your
team searched the whole home, correct?
A. Yes.



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
Q. Okay. You gave her a copy of the search warrant, I'm
assuming?
A. I did not.
Q. Okay. But she didn't stand in the way of you searching the
home, right?
A. No, she did not.
Q. Neither did the boyfriend who was on crutches, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. And certainly the wife didn't stand in the way, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. His wife is about 60 years old; is that right?
A. I have no idea.
Q. Wasn't she nervous when you watched her?
A. I didn't watch her. I——I saw her for——briefly. I spoke
with the daughter, I took her to get the dogs, brought them
back down, I let her know that, you know, if she needed to
bring them out, to feed them, it's not a problem, just let us
know, and then we proceeded.
Q. And then you started to search the house. You said there
were at least about 20 other people, correct?
A. Yeah. Oh, at least.
Q. Okay. And when you say at least, were there more than 20?
A. I think we had approximately 40 people searching.
Q. Okay. So you had 40 people searching, three residents in
the home, right?



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
A. Yes.
Q. And nobody interfered with your search.
A. No.
Q. Okay. At the time that you executed the search at
373——that's what I'm going to call it, okay——did you know how
many other homes Mr. Guo had?
A. No.
Q. Did you know he had a home in New York City?
A. I know that they were doing other warrants at the same
time. I'm not sure which homes he owned or where he lived.
Q. Okay. At the time that you executed the search did you
know Mr. Guo to have a lawyer?
A. I have no idea.
MR. FINKEL: Objection.
THE COURT: Overruled.
Q. At the time that you went to search Mr. Guo's home, did you
know anything about his status in the United States?
MR. FINKEL: Objection.
THE COURT: If you'll step up, please.
(Continued on next page)



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: So this is beyond the direct.
MS. SHROFF: I'm happy to call her as my own witness
then, your Honor. But I'm allowed to have some latitude about
what she knew when she executed the search warrant. I'd be
happy to be more constrained, your Honor, but——
THE COURT: So whether he had a lawyer, I allowed
that, but now going into his immigration status, I think that's
just going beyond.
MS. SHROFF: Well, she took——she took hundreds of
documents from his home. I'm entitled to ask what other
documents she took and what other documents he elicited
testimony about.
THE COURT: Are there documents that relate to his
immigration status?
MR. FINKEL: I don't know, but I understood from their
response to our letter the other night that his immigration
status is not at issue and it isn't——it's irrelevant. And I
also understood from your Honor's ruling the presence of
lawyers is not something that the defense was going to dwell
on, nor should they suggest, by implying to the jury that
Mr. Guo had a lawyer, somehow the search was improper. The
search was proper. It was judicially authorized.
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, asking if somebody has a
lawyer does not imply that a search is improper, number one.



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
Number two, she recovered documents. If they want to
cherry pick as to what they put in, I'm allowed to explore what
else was out there. We have no interest, and, you know, the
immigration issue——
THE COURT: You can ask whether or not there were
documents related to immigration status.
MS. SHROFF: Right. And that shows that a person
lived in their home; personal documents were in his home.
My——the point of my cross is to show that's his residential
home. I'm not seeking to present a defense that he has an
immigration consequence through this conviction, which is what
the brief was about, so I don't know why that's being brought
up here. Totally irrelevant.
THE COURT: So there's no dispute as to whether or not
it was used as a home, is there?
MS. SHROFF: Oh, yes. Their argument is that Mahwah
was also a home, and I'm trying to show this was his home
alone, nothing that is recovered here is anywhere comparable to
anything recovered in Mahwah. I am entitled to show that.
THE COURT: So you're saying this is his principal
home?
MS. SHROFF: His only residential home.
THE COURT: Okay. Well, she can bring out some
evidence on that issue.
MR. FINKEL: Certainly. It shouldn't suggest



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
immigration status. Immigration status is not something that's
relevant.
MS. SHROFF: We're not talking about a status. I have
a status, you have a status. I'm an American passport holder.
That's my status. If my passport is in my home, it's more
likely it's my home, it's less likely it's your home, right?
MR. FINKEL: I completely agree the passport is——
THE COURT: Sure. But you were asking about his
immigration status.
MS. SHROFF: I'll move from there and ask him if she
found some immigration-related document or his immigration
paperwork, his identity card, his wallet. I'm entitled to ask
all of that.
MR. FINKEL: Your Honor, no objection to identity
card, no objection to wallet. My objection is for 402, 403
reasons to immigration documents and immigration status.
That's not appropriate. It's not relevant. I have no issue
with them exploring personal effects that were there. That's
fine. But——
MS. SHROFF: We're not arguing he's going to be
deported or anything like that. We're just trying to show that
he had immigration paperwork at his home.
THE COURT: But ask for a passport as opposed to, do
you know what his immigration status was.
MS. SHROFF: Sure. I'd be happy to rephrase.



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
THE COURT: Thank you.
(In open court)
THE COURT: Objection is overruled.
BY MS. SHROFF:
Q. Agent McNamara, how many hours did you spend searching the
home?
A. None. I didn't search.
Q. Okay. You simply supervised the search, correct?
A. Correct, mm-hmm.
Q. And you were directly supervising how many people?
A. Approximately 40.
Q. 40 people, correct?
A. Mm-hmm.
Q. And 40 people were given the task of searching different
parts of the home, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Every bedroom was searched, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Every living room was searched, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Closets were searched, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Bathrooms were searched, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So in the closets, and it's——if I could please



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
have——actually, I rephrase that.
You were shown pictures of the closet, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And in the closet there were white shirts hanging, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Shoes?
A. Yes.
Q. Other men's clothing, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And did you know who those clothing belonged to?
A. No.
Q. Did you make any effort to find out whose clothing they
were?
A. No, that's not part of the search.
Q. Okay. And then you searched the kitchen, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. The kitchen was an average kitchen with kitchen-related
things in it, correct?
A. It was a very nice kitchen with kitchen-related things in
it, yes.
Q. Okay. But there was food there on the counter, correct?
A. There was food. I don't recall specifically what the food
was.
Q. Okay. And after you searched the kitchen, you searched the
other rooms, correct?



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
A. I did not search.
Q. Well, you testified to a lot of photographs during the
search, so I apologize.
You supervised the search where those rooms were
searched, correct?
A. Yes, ma'am, yes.
Q. Okay. Let's take a look at the photographs of the garage,
shall we, so that we can talk about that red Lamborghini.
Did you enter the garage to look for the red
Lamborghini?
A. I entered through the garage but not to look for the
Lamborghini.
Q. And is it fair to say that you had emailed with your team
about a search warrant for that particular Lamborghini,
correct?
A. The seizure warrant for the Lamborghini was included, yes.
Q. You emailed about the seizure warrant, correct?
A. I emailed the entire team, the search warrant and the
seizure warrant.
Q. Okay. And you had the seizure warrant for the car
separately discussed, right? It was an important issue for
you, correct?
MR. FINKEL: Objection. Vagueness.
THE COURT: What is the question?
Q. Sure. You were specifically told to look for a red



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
Lamborghini, correct?
A. No. It was——we had a seizure warrant for the Lamborghini,
but nobody said: Make sure you find the Lamborghini.

showed them to you when you were preparing for your testimony

O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross
There's an evidence tag on those keys, correct?
A. There's a tag. I'm not sure what——what kind of tag this
is.
Q. Okay. But it's a tag put on by your people, right? That
tag wasn't on the keys when you first——when you got the keys,
right?
A. I have no idea who put this tag on. They were not on the
keys at the time.

O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Cross

recollection. Objection.
MS. SHROFF: I believe she couldn't remember——
THE COURT: No, she did not say she could not recall.

Q. Okay. And you came in early 'cause you wanted to be
prepared for testimony here today, right?

that——where it had——it's like an office and it had cam——display
monitors with——for the security cameras.
Q. And the security, that's where you were told that the keys
were put, correct?
A. That's where the keys were found.
Q. Okay. So the keys were not found in the garage where the
car was, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. They were not found inside the car where one would leave
them if they used the car every day, correct?
MR. FINKEL: Objection, as to form.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Were they found inside the car?

MR. FINKEL: Object as to form.
THE COURT: I did not hear that.
MR. FINKEL: Objection as to form.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A. Nobody gave me anything. I managed the search. The
searchers searched, the photographers took the photographs,
they entered the items into our evidence list so we had a list
of what was taken, and they packaged it. They didn't hand them
to me to do that.
Q. Okay. Fair enough. And the search you said took four
hours, right?
A. Approximately four hours, yes.
Q. Nobody bothered you during your search, correct?
A. No.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MR. FINKEL:
Q. Special Agent McNamara, what was the role of you and your
team on March 15, 2023?
A. To help execute the search warrant.
Q. And when documents or physical items are recovered from a
search, what, if anything, does the FBI do to keep track of
where those materials come from?
A. So they're seized by the seizing agent, and then it starts
a chain of custody.
Q. And can you explain a little bit about how it's tracked
where particular materials are recovered from.
Like which room, for example.
A. Oh, sure. So when someone finds an item in a room, we send
the photographer, they take a photo in place. When we do our
photos, we give each room a letter, so when that item is
recovered, we'll say, give a description of the item, say, you
know, cellphone serial number so and so was located in room B
on desk. And then we put the people who——the two people who
actually found and witnessed that item.
Q. And was that procedure followed on March 15, 2023?
A. Yes.
Q. And Special Agent McNamara, when the FBI leaves, what
precautions or what's the policy and procedures right before
leaving? What does the FBI do?



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Redirect
A. With the evidence?
Q. The evidence and the photographs.
A. Oh. So there is a seizing agent, so there's one person
that takes custody of the evidence, and they start the chain of
custody, and they bring that evidence to the evidence room,
where it gets logged in and put into the case file. The
photographs, like I——I believe I said earlier, the photographer
takes the SD card and burns it directly to disks, so we don't
put it in a computer first, and then we make an original copy
that goes into the case file, a backup of the original copy
into the case file, a copy for the case agent, and then, should
we need another copy for the lab, or for sending stuff to
forensics, for forensics, then we make a fourth copy.
Q. Special Agent McNamara, do you know what stats FBI, the New
York FBI investigative team, took prior to the search on
March 15, 2023, with respect to this case?
A. No.
Q. Do you know what steps FBI——what investigative steps they
took after March 15th of 2023?
A. No.
Q. Do you know if the case agent——what's a case agent?
A. It's usually——there's usually one, sometimes more, assigned
as the——the responsible person for that case.
Q. And do you know if the case agents——are you a case agent on
this case?



O5O1GUO3 McNamara - Recross
A. No.
Q. Do you know if the case agents know what Saraca means?
A. I have no idea.
Q. Do you know if the case agents have reviewed those
documents?
A. I don't know.
Q. And discussed them with the U.S. Attorney's Office?
A. I don't know.
Q. Whether the case agents have gotten other search warrants?
MS. SHROFF: Your Honor, the case agent isn't
testifying here today.
THE COURT: He's asked whether she knows what the case
agent has done or not done. She may answer.
A. I do not know.
Q. And Special Agent McNamara, aside from the search March 15,
2023, do you have any other involvement in this matter?
A. No.
MR. FINKEL: Thank you, Special Agent McNamara.
THE COURT: Recross?
MS. SHROFF: Very briefly.

titles. I don't know.
Q. So you are only——your knowledge for this jury is only
limited to what he told you to testify about.

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. SHROFF:
Q. How are you doing, Mr. Bonsukan?
A. Good.
Q. You work at Lamborghini Dallas; is that right?
A. I do.
Q. Okay. Sorry about that. I can't see you.
And you were the one in charge of this particular
sale; correct?
A. I helped facilitate the paperwork on the particular sale.



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross
Q. Okay. Is it fair to say that you don't remember anybody
coming to like view the car, like you buy an average car,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. Nobody came to see it, right?
A. Not that I'm aware.
Q. Okay. And you said that, is it -- did I get it right that
Dallas Lamborghini sells about 35 of these cars a month?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And is it like an everyday car or is it like a
sporting car or a racing car?
A. It's, in the car world, called an exotic car. So there's
not very many made. Enthusiasts that love the brand buy the
car.
Q. Okay. And people generally buy the car because it could be
fun to ride in the car; is that right?
A. Yes.
MS. MURRAY: Objection.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. It's not an everyday-use car, right?
A. Not normally.
Q. Not normally. Okay.
And you've been doing this for 13 years; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And this was one of many sales you made during the course



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross
of your employment in Dallas; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So let me just walk -- just ask you a couple of
questions about the documents that you were shown by Ms. Murray
over here, okay?
MS. SHROFF: If I could just have first CT-39, please.
Q. You recognize this car, right?
A. Yes, this is a Lamborghini Aventador.
Q. What does "Aventador" even mean, can you tell us?
A. Aventador is the name of a model of a particular
Lamborghini that was built. Normally they're named after a
bull or a famous bull or a bullfighter.
Q. Okay. And this is the car that you sold, right?
A. It appears to be, yes.
Q. Okay. Could you tell us please what is this wire thing
that comes out of the car for?
A. It's a battery tender. Basically, maintaining the battery
as it sits in a garage, so it's fresh whenever the client wants
to drive it the next time.
Q. So do you normally do this if you're using the car every
day or do you charge up a battery when the car is not used
frequently?
A. It varies. The car is -- even when it's off, the computer
systems are still working. So a lot of owners always want to
keep a fresh battery, so they plug it up.



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross
Q. Okay. And you wouldn't -- you can't tell how often the car
is used; correct?
A. No.
Q. Okay.
MS. SHROFF: Could I have please -- I could have that
taken down. And if I could please have put up BR-460.
Q. And 460 is the document that you received from Ms. Murray
right here who did your direct testimony; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And she asked you for documents and you sent them to
her; correct?
A. Correct.
Q. You've never spoken to me, right?
A. No.
Q. And you've never spoken to anybody else on the defense
table?
A. No. No, ma'am.
Q. Okay. And I never asked you for any documents; correct?
A. No.
MS. SHROFF: Okay. So let's look at the next
document. Could we look at CT-38.
Q. And all of the documents pertain to this car; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And Ms. Murray asked you some questions about the type of
door that this car has, right?



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross
A. Yes.
Q. And it's a scissor door; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. Does that mean anything? I mean, it's just a door, right,
a straight door, a scissor door?
A. On a Lamborghini --
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
A. On a Lamborghini, it is a particular characteristic of the
particular model, which would be the Aventador.
Q. It's just like a gimmick, right?
A. Not necessarily a gimmick. It's just a particular type of
door that they have.
Q. Okay. And on this car there is what is called a VIN
number, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And the VIN number is the vehicle identification number;
correct?
A. Yes, ma'am.
Q. And it's fair to say, right, every car has a VIN number?
A. Yes.
Q. A Subaru has a VIN number?
A. Yes.
Q. And Ford has a VIN number?
A. Yes.
Q. So as opposed to this fancy car, if I just went and bought



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross
myself a regular old car, it would have a VIN number, right?
A. Yes, it would.
Q. Okay. So nothing special about the VIN number on this car?
A. No, just the identifying mark of that particular car.
Q. Okay. Great.
MS. SHROFF: So let's look at, please, 295, GC-295.
And if you could just scroll down.
Q. These are email exchanges you had about the sale of this
car; correct?
A. Are you still scrolling? It looks like from Max to a
number of people.
Q. Right. And you never -- you've testified you never spoke
to Max Krasner, right?
A. No, not -- not physically or -- it's just through email.
Q. Okay. And you just emailed back and forth because you
wanted the sale to go through; correct?
A. Yes.

want to sell the car?
A. Yes.
Q. And there was nothing untoward about the sale of this car;
correct?
A. No.
Q. You had no red flags while you were selling this car;

O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross

that said Proton; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. You get emails from gmail; correct?
A. Yes.

secret password; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. The top secret password was 123456; correct?
A. Yes.
MS. SHROFF: Okay. And if I could have that taken
down and please show 295. Would you scroll down. I'm sorry.
Q. And these emails go back and forth all through you -- all
through your dealership until September, right?
MS. MURRAY: Your Honor, objection. I think
Ms. Shroff is asking about a different document than the one
that's displayed for the jury right now.
MS. SHROFF: 460 is what I want, please.



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross
THE COURT: Is this the correct document?
MS. MURRAY: It is, your Honor, pages 19 to 22.
BY MS. SHROFF:
Q. So let's start with page 19. You see that email that's
right there says: "Hi Max, we have -- "
MS. SHROFF: There you go. Thank you.
Q. "We have signed copies of the buyer's order." Correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Odometer and dealer reassignment form, right?
A. Yes.
Q. By the way, sitting here today, do you recall if this was a
used car that you were reselling?
A. It is a pre-owned vehicle.
Q. Right. So it's -- by "pre-owned," you mean it was used
before, right?
A. Yes.
Q. It's not a brand-new Lamborghini, right?
A. No.
Q. Okay. So this is a used car that is being resold to
somebody, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Sitting here today, do you know how old that car
was?
A. During that time?
Q. Yeah.



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross
A. In 2021? So it was a 2021 model for Lamborghini and we
sold it in 2021.
Q. Okay. So how many owners had there been before it, do you
know?
A. I'm not sure.
Q. Do you know if it was more than one?
A. Possibly.
Q. Okay. You don't really know, right? It could have been
one, two, three, you just don't know?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. And sorry about that. And at this point in this
email chain, which is October 19 of 2021, right? Somebody is
giving you an address of where the -- do you read this email as
telling you where to send the paperwork or where to send the
car?
A. To send the title.
Q. To send the title, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And do you send the title to that address?
A. I don't. My title clerk does.
Q. Okay. And do you know what is located at 162 East 64th
Street?
A. No.
Q. Do you know what business is located there?
A. No.



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross
Q. Do you know who works there?
A. No.
Q. Have you ever heard of a person named Miles Guo? Have you
ever heard of a person named Miles Guo?
A. No.
Q. Okay.
MS. SHROFF: If we could just scroll down, please.
Q. And there is a conversation here about the passport;
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you get a copy of a passport, do you not?
A. Yes.
Q. And why do you need the passport, sir?
A. Gives identification of who the person that would be
signing off for the company when they buy a particular vehicle.
Q. Okay. And you got -- you got a copy of the passport;
correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And, of course, you did whatever you needed to do to verify
that that was a correct passport, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And then after that --
MS. SHROFF: If you could close that, please.
Q. You have an email that asks you if you can assist with
transport. And then they said that assistance for transport



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross
can be provided; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And when you're transporting the car, you would only
transport the car out of your dealership after the things on
your checklist have been met; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. You want to make sure title passes correctly, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Registration, right?
A. Yes. We don't do the registration on a cash deal, but we
make sure that the title is signed over to the correct buyer.
Q. Okay. And you also want to make sure that the buyer has a
driver's license, right?
A. Not necessarily a driver's license, just identification.
Q. Okay. So you want to make sure that the person is properly
identified, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you did that; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And after you took all of those steps, you were
going to ship the car out to whatever address they told you,
right?
A. Yes.
Q. Sitting here today, do you recall if the car was originally
supposed to go to a different address?



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross
A. No.
Q. You don't recall?
A. I don't recall, no.
Q. Okay. And is it fair to say that where a car goes also
determines the cost of the insurance of a car?
A. Well, the shipping carrier -- when we set up shipping for
our client, we want to make sure that the shipping carrier, A,
might be familiar with the vehicle in transporting a vehicle of
this amount; and making sure that we have ample insurance to
cover if something were to happen during transport for a
client.
Q. Right. But that is the insurance on the transport part of
the car, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Would you agree with me, as a person who's been in the car
business for 13 years, that each state has a certain cost for
maintaining insurance on the car?
A. I'm vaguely familiar.
Q. Some states are more expensive than others; correct?
A. Probably, yeah.
Q. Insurance depends on whether the car is placed in a garage
or parked on the street; correct?
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
The witness has said that he is vaguely familiar.



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross
MS. SHROFF: He might know the answer, your Honor.
THE COURT: With that understanding, he can answer.
Q. Do you know if insurance rates differ state to state?
A. No.
Q. Do you know if insurance is higher if you park the car on a
street versus if you park the car in the garage?
A. It depends on the insurance company.
Q. Okay. Fair enough.
MS. SHROFF: Could I have number 504, please. It's
okay, actually.
Q. When you were getting ready to ship the car, you were given
an address; correct?
A. I wasn't given the address. I have a sales assistant that
actually does our transportation for us that works with the
dealership.
Q. Okay. So once you finish of the sale of the car, somebody
else takes over to make sure the car gets to where it's
supposed to get, right?
A. Yes. Normally, the salesperson and our sales assistant.
Q. And would you know what is the markup on a used car?
A. The markup on a used car?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. It could vary.
Q. Do you know how much the markup on this car was?
A. In that particular instance, a Lamborghini Aventador,



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Cross
brand-new 2021 model would be, MSRP — manufacturer's suggested
retail price — at $650,000.
Q. Okay. And you don't know how long this car was sitting on
the parking lot before it was brought out, right?
A. Not -- no, not in particular. I could find out, but no.
Not long.
Q. When you were interacting with this person named Max,
correct, he was telling you or at least somebody in your office
where the car was going to go; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And Max you understood was part of G Clubs; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And he represented G Clubs' interest to you when he was
emailing with you; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And Max Krasner from the emails, you can conclude, knew
that the car was going to go to Connecticut; correct?
A. Yes.
MS. SHROFF: Okay. Could I have one moment, your
Honor?
THE COURT: Yes.
(Counsel conferred)
Q. Who did you talk to when trying to figure out the final
price sale of the car?
A. I didn't speak with anyone.



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Redirect
Q. I'm sorry, I cut you off.
A. Normally, the salesperson negotiates the price with the
particular client.
Q. So you have no idea how many times Max Krasner talked to
the salesperson and went back and forth before arriving at the
final purchase price?
A. No.
Q. You do not know how long those negotiations lasted;
correct?
A. No.
Q. And do you know if Mr. Krasner or anyone else from G Clubs
did an inspection of the car before it was shipped?
A. I don't recall. It could be possible.
MS. SHROFF: I have nothing further, your Honor.
Thank you.
THE COURT: Redirect.
MS. MURRAY: Yes, your Honor. Briefly.
REDIRECT EXAMINATION
BY MS. MURRAY:
Q. Mr. Bonsukan, you were just asked some questions about how
long that Lamborghini that we've been talking about was on the
lot. Do you recall those?
A. Yes.
Q. And you indicated it was not long; is that correct?
A. Yes.



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Redirect
Q. What do you recall about the volume of sales that
Lamborghini Dallas was doing during this time period, fall of
2021?
A. Fall of 2021, obviously in the COVID times, vehicle sales
were -- on a naturally aspirated engine, which would be this
Aventador, were going like crazy because Lamborghini announced
that they were going to start doing hybrid engines on their
vehicles. So collectors and people that loved this car would
try buying it, even if they're buying it for more than what the
original MSRP is.
Q. And you mentioned that the MSRP on this car was
approximately what?
A. Approximately 650,000.
MS. MURRAY: And Ms. Loftus, if we could pull up,
please, Government Exhibit BR-460 at page 2.
Q. And focusing on the final sale price of this car here, what
was the final sale price of this particular car, this used car?
A. The unpaid balance is $832,000.75.
Q. That's nearly $200,000 more than the manufacturer's
suggested retail price; is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And this was a used car, but it was the same year as it was
ultimately sold to G Clubs, right?
A. Yes.
MS. MURRAY: Ms. Loftus, if we could zoom out on this



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Recross
and go to the left and look at the mileage listed for this
particular car. It's on the top left description of sale unit.
Q. Mr. Bonsukan, how many miles were on this car when it was
sold to G Club International?
A. 317 Miles.
MS. MURRAY: All right, Ms. Loftus. We can zoom out
of that and go to the top again to the seller and the buyer
names listed.
Q. Now, Mr. Bonsukan, you testified on cross-examination that
you didn't know a person named Miles Guo; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know what the "G" in G Club International Limited
stands for?
A. No.
MS. MURRAY: Just a moment please, your Honor.
(Counsel conferred)
MS. MURRAY: Nothing further.
THE COURT: Recross.
MS. SHROFF: Yes, your Honor.
Could you just leave that exhibit. Thank you.
RECROSS EXAMINATION
BY MS. SHROFF:
Q. The Lamborghini that was sold, the red Lamborghini, right?
A. Yes.
Q. That was almost a collector's car; correct?



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Recross
A. Yes, could be.
Q. It was actually an investment; correct?
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
MS. SHROFF: She brought it out.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. The price was higher than a brand-new car, right? You
testified for Ms. Murray about that, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And why was that?
A. Why is the price higher? Because it's a popular vehicle in
terms of the Lamborghini world, when a lot of people were
trying to buy these cars.
Q. And they were going to change the model; correct? You
testified to it on direct, something about it going hybrid;
correct?
A. Yes, eventually.
Q. Right. And the model G Clubs bought would only go up in
value because they were going to stop making those Lamborghinis
that way; correct?
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: You may answer.
A. Possibly.
Q. Well, you testified on direct that if the price was going
to go up, people were going crazy, they wanted to keep that
model, right?



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Recross
A. It would be a risk, yeah, possibility where it could go up.
But it also could go down.
Q. Right. But that is why people were buying it, right?
A. Yes.
Q. You testified that they were literally hot off the parking
lot because everybody thought this would be a collector's
model, right?
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: That's a mischaracterization of his
testimony. Sustained.
Q. People were buying it during the pandemic nonstop; correct?
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. Did the sales go up during the pandemic?
A. Sales did go up, yes.
Q. Of that red model, right?
A. Amongst a lot of other models as well.
Q. Right. But the red model was included in the one where the
sales are going up, right?
A. That's correct. It's a rare car of Lamborghini.
Q. Exactly. Thank you.
MS. SHROFF: Could I just have this exhibit made
bigger.
Q. And you see on the left-hand side where the description of
the sale unit is listed?



O5OVGUO4 Bonsukan - Recross
A. Yes.
Q. And it says used; correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And when you go down, if you read further down on
this document, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. The salesperson's name is Mr. Durkey. And that's
the person on the email chain that Ms. Murray had you read
about; correct?
A. Correct. Yes.
Q. And he's the person who finalized the sale, right?
A. He would be the one point of contact of negotiating with
the customer.
MS. SHROFF: Okay. And if I could just have that
shrunk and the next page of the document shown, please.
Q. And this page shows you just an average sale of a car no
different --
MS. MURRAY: Objection, your Honor. Scope.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Q. The car that was driven off the lot was insured, right?
A. Probably, yeah.
Q. Okay. And it was dropped off in Connecticut; correct?
MS. MURRAY: Objection.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MS. SHROFF: I'm done, your Honor. Thank you.




THE COURT: Thank you, sir. You may step out.
THE WITNESS: Thank you, your Honor.
(Witness excused)
THE COURT: Is that the last witness for today?
MS. MURRAY: We have another witness ready, your
Honor. But given the time, we defer to the Court whether you'd
like us to start a few minutes or whether we should stop for
today.
THE COURT: All right. I think we should stop for
today. You may step out.
One moment.
Members of the jury, we have finished our work for
today. Monday is Memorial Day, and so you're going to be
returning to court according to the instructions that have been
given to you so that you'll be able to walk into the courtroom
at 9:30 sharp. It's very, very important that you follow those
instructions closely and that you get here on time.
Remember that you're not allowed to discuss the case
amongst yourselves. Don't permit anyone to discuss the case in
your presence. It's always tempting, once you start to hear
witness testimony, to want to discuss the case, but that is
absolutely prohibited.
I wish you a wonderful long weekend, and I look
forward to seeing you on Tuesday.
(Jury not present)




THE COURT: Please be seated.
I'm going to ask that Alternate No. 5 be brought in.
Is there anything that the parties wanted to raise?
MS. SHROFF: No, your Honor.
MS. MURRAY: No, your Honor.
(Juror present)
THE COURT: Hi. You're Alternate No. 5, right?
JUROR: I am. Yes.
THE COURT: I received a note from you and you raised
certain concerns. But now with the understanding of the
transportation arrangements, my sense is that your schedule can
work with the second option that was discussed; is that
correct?
JUROR: Correct. Up until the point of where my child
is finished school June 18th.
THE COURT: And then?
JUROR: The summer plans will now have to be changed
in order for me to continue to be a juror.
THE COURT: And so that you can do that, you can make
those changes?
JUROR: I haven't even begun to figure out what that
would entail.
THE COURT: Well, I ask that you work on that and that
you return on Tuesday. Thank you.
JUROR: Thank you.




(Juror not present)
THE COURT: All right. If there's nothing further,
then I wish everyone a good holiday weekend.
MS. MURRAY: Thank you, your Honor. You as well.
